# Trend in India's Trade Performance

## TREND IN INDIA'S TRADE PERFORMANCE

3.21  India's trade sector has demonstrated remarkable stability and growth, achieving milestones despite global economic headwinds. Following a dip in FY20 amid the global downturn and the pandemic, overall exports rebounded strongly in FY22, reaching a  record  high  in  FY23.  This  momentum  continued  into  FY24,  with  overall  exports surpassing the previous year's record, even as imports moderated slightly.

3.22  India's total exports (merchandise+services) have shown positive momentum in the first nine months of FY25, reaching USD 602.6 billion, witnessing a YoY growth of 6 per cent. This increase demonstrates the resilience of exports, which have been building on a steady upward trend in recent years despite global economic challenges. Total imports during April-December 2024 reached USD 682.2 billion, registering a YoY growth of 6.9 per cent. This positive import growth indicates a steady demand for goods in the Indian market, supporting domestic consumption and production needs. A more significant increase in overall imports compared to exports led to a rise in the overall trade deficit from USD 69.7 billion during April-December 2023 to USD 79.5 billion in the corresponding period of FY25.

3.23  During April-December 2024, non-petroleum exports were  up by 7.1 per cent. Over the same period, non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery exports rose by 9.1 per cent. Specific sectors like drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronic goods, engineering

goods, and chemicals saw an increase in exports, growing by 6.4 per cent, 28.6 per cent, 9.9 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively, during April-December 2024 on a YoY basis. Textile exports 53  also saw a YoY increase of 7.6 per cent during the same period. Rising inflationary pressures on cereals, pulses, and edible oils limited the exports of agricultural  and  allied  products.  Overall,  merchandise  exports  registered  a  modest growth  of  1.6  per  cent  (YoY  basis)  primarily  attributed  to  a  decline  in  the  value  of petroleum product exports due to a fall in international commodity prices.

3.24 Merchandise  imports  grew  by  5.2  per  cent  during  April-December  2024.  This increase was largely due to a rise in non-oil, non-gold imports, which reached USD 352.1 billion in the first nine months of FY25 compared to USD 340.5 billion during the same period last year, indicating a rebound in domestic consumption despite the inflationary impact. Gold imports increased due to higher international prices, driven by frontloading ahead of festival spending and demand for safe-haven assets. Among the major non-oil, non-gold imports, non-ferrous metals, machine tools, machinery, electrical  &amp;  non-electrical  goods,  and  transport  equipment  witnessed  remarkable growth  in  the  first  nine  months  of  FY25,  reflecting  growing  demand  for  capital goods.  Electronic  goods  also  maintained  consistent  momentum,  signalling  a  rise  in discretionary consumer spending. Additionally, imports of pulses and cotton rose to support domestic production and control inflation.

3.25   The  faster  pace  of  increase  in  merchandise  imports  compared  to  exports contributed to the widening of the merchandise trade deficit to USD 210.8 billion in April-December 2024, compared to USD 189.7 billion in the same period last year.

53    Textile exports include Cotton Yarn/Fabrics/made-ups, Handloom Products, Man-made Yarn/Fabrics/madeups, etc., RMG of all Textiles, Jute Mfg. including Floor covering, carpet and Handicrafts, excluding handmade carpet.

## Textile exports

3.26 India's textile sector has been a matter of pride and strength to the nation for centuries. From the unique prints and weaves to the rich dyes and handwork, the textile sector weaves various aspects of our cultural, social, and historical heritage. India is the sixth-largest exporter of textiles and apparel globally. The textile and apparel industry contributes 2.3 per cent of GDP, 13 per cent to industrial production, and 12 per cent to exports. 54 It is also one of the largest employment generators after agriculture, with over 45 million people employed directly, including many women and the rural population. 55 As further evidence of the inclusive nature of this industry, nearly 80 per cent of its capacity is spread across Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) clusters in the country. 56

3.27    India  exported  textile  items  worth  USD  34  billion  in  2023,  with  apparel constituting  42  per  cent  of  the  export  basket  (USD  14.6  billion),  followed  by  raw materials/semi-finished materials at 34 per cent (USD 11.7 billion) and finished nonapparel goods at 30 per cent (USD 7.8 billion). 57  Europe and the US consumed nearly 66 per cent of India's apparel exports, 58 per cent of finished non-apparel goods and 12  per  cent  of  raw  materials/semi-finished  materials.  Other  prominent  destinations include the UK (8 per cent of apparel exports) and the UAE (7 per cent).

3.28  Generally, the Indian textile export basket is skewed towards cotton and cottonbased products. In 2023, for example, eight out of the top 10 textile exports (by value) consisted of cotton and cotton-based products. For India's major textile export category,

57  Analysis based on UN COMTRADE data at the tariff level.

i.e.,  apparel,  the  country  enjoyed  a  market  share  of  2.8  per  cent  globally  in  2023. However, this is much lower than that of key players in the industry, such as China (30 per cent), Bangladesh (9 per cent), and Vietnam (7 per cent). Further analysis at the HS-6 levels reveals that while India offers stiff competition to other exporters 58 for nearly USD 3 billion worth of apparel exports, the remaining apparel basket is yet to match our competitors' comparative advantage.

3.29 Textile  exports  remained  resilient  throughout  the  COVID-19  period  between 2020 to 2022, but their performance has been weak over a decadal timeframe. Box III.3 elaborates on potential factors that impede export growth and opportunities that must be tapped for the sector to reach its goal of USD 150 billion in textile exports by 2030. 59

## Box III.3: Time to be deft about our warp and weft!

## Costs that chip away at textile export growth

India's  textile  production  occurs  across  multiple  independent  and  clustered  Small  and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) spread across the country. Take cotton production, for example, which is spread across Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. The fresh produce of cotton then travels down to Tamil Nadu, where cotton yarns are produced. The yarns then travel to parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat before being weaved into cotton fabric. A lack of localisation and the complexity of the value chain, in turn, results in higher costs relative to global competitors. In contrast, vertically integrated 'fibre-to-fashion' firms in competitor nations such as China and Vietnam export low-cost products, maintain consistent quality and are nimble enough to adjust to the fast-changing nature of the industry. Simple and liberal customs procedures further reduce regulatory costs and lend a competitive edge to the exports of global textile competitors such as China and Vietnam.

On the other hand, in India textile exporters are constrained by complex procedures, which, for instance, require exporters to meticulously account for every square centimetre of fabric, buttons and zippers used. Similarly, pre-shipment inspection certificates are required for textile imports, which slows down logistics and raises costs for the textile business. 60

58    Exports at the HS-6 level enjoy a market share that is within the periphery or higher than the market share of China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.

60    GTRI report, July 2024, 'How complex procedures, import restrictions and domestic interests hinder India's garment exports',  https://tinyurl.com/yxjxjzyz.

Apart from possessing structural attributes (such as vertical integration, liberal labour laws, etc.) that allow for cost advantages, competitors in the textile market also have the added benefit of FTAs with consumer countries. In effect, Indian apparel exports do not face a level playing field compared to its competition. For instance, as noted by Mukherjee et al. 2019 61 , even though India has a significant comparative advantage in exporting silk shawls and scarves, the country faces a high tariff rate of 11.3 per cent in the US. In comparison, competitors like Korea face zero tariffs on their silk scarf exports due to trade agreements such as the US-Korea FTA.

In  general,  the  costs  for  the  textile  industry  are  likely  to  rise  over  the  coming  years.  A global  structural  shift  towards  sustainable  sourcing  would  drive  this.  Often,  such  a  shift is  necessitated by regulatory changes. The EU, for instance, has as many as 16 pieces of legislation spanning the entire fashion value chain, which came into force between 2021 and 2024. 62  As the EU accounts for nearly 20 per cent of our exports, such a shift poses a challenge for small enterprises who need to shift to environmentally sustainable production methods.

## Changing trends in the global textile industry

India has a great opportunity to align with the evolving global shifts in apparel demand. While our comparative advantage lies in cotton and cotton-based products, global demand has shifted to products made from man-made fibre (MMF). MMF-based products range from  yoga  pants  and  athleisure  wear  to  technical  textiles  in  aviation,  aerospace,  and automobiles.

As  per  International  Cotton  Association,  MMF  comprised  77  per  cent  of  global  fibre consumption in 2024, whereas it was just 22 per cent for cotton.

By tapping into the MMF value chain, India will benefit from the steady rise in global MMF demand. India's share of global MMF production is currently 9.2 per cent, and the potential to catch up with the production levels of global leaders like Vietnam, China, and Taiwan is high. 63

To match the quality of our competition and reap value gains from MMF production, our MMF sector must move towards vertical integration and significantly invest in research and development and sustainable production techniques.

## Fashioning  India's  textile  exports  to  a  global  audience-recent  schemes  and opportunities ahead

In recent years, the government has announced many policies in response to the changing nature of global demand and high relative costs faced by Indian exporters. A PLI scheme has been put in place for the sector with an outlay of ₹10,683 crore, which rewards capacity

creation through investments in the industry. As MMF products require heavy research and development suited to different use cases, the National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM) has been approved with an outlay of ₹1,480 crore. As of 2024, 168 research projects (worth ₹509 crore) were approved under the NTTM mission. 64

In response to the need for a vertically integrated textile industry, the government-sanctioned Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM-MITRA) parks across seven sites in 2022 to create world-class plug-and-play infrastructure and invite FDI into the  textile  sector.  World-class,  standardised  infrastructure  will  also  aid  textile  exporters in  responding  better  to  changing  ESG  requirements  in  the  industry.  To  help  with  cost competitiveness, the Government approved the continuation of the Scheme for Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) for export of Apparel/Garments and Madeups up to 31 March 2026 in the interim Union Budget FY25 65 . Further, deep FTAs such as the UAE-India CEPA (2022) have helped reduce India's textile tariffs with a significant market. India is actively working towards negotiating trade deals with top importers such as the EU and the UK.

India's  textile  sector  has  several  tailwinds  working  in  its  favour.  For  instance,  as  per McKinsey's  chief  procurement  officer  survey,  the  share  of  procurement  officers  looking to form long-term strategic partnerships (including volume commitments) has more than doubled between 2019 and 2023. 66  Further, more than 40 per cent of procurement officers surveyed plan to increase their sourcing from India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

66  McKinsey article, 'Reimagining the apparel value chain amid volatility', https://tinyurl.com/2nhedse4.

While there are tailwinds which will support the growth of India's textile exports, these cannot be fully exploited without lowering the costs of the textile basket and deepening our market share in the MMF sector. These objectives would require the industry to step up its research efforts and vertically integrate and tailor products to international quality and sustainability requirements.

Simplification, consolidation, and elimination of processes that consume the financial and managerial bandwidth of our exporters is a low-hanging fruit. Addressing these challenges can significantly reduce costs and ease the burden on exporters, helping them become more efficient and competitive.

## Diversification of India's exports to new markets

3.30  As discussed in a Collection of Essays of the Department of Economic Affairs 67 , over time, India has added a large number of new products to its export basket. Between 1994 and 2022, India has not just carved out new markets but has become the market leader  in  some  of  the  new  product  categories.  For  instance,  India  is  a  top  exporter of  shipping vessels (with nearly 33 per cent market share). Similarly, it is a leading exporter of iron and steel alloys, an unexplored market before 1994.

3.31  Between April and November 2024, India's exports saw significant growth and expansion into diverse markets despite high global challenges. The analysis depicts the number of diverse markets, consisting of absolutely new markets where no exports were  observed  between  April  and  November  2023,  but  exports  happened  in  the corresponding period of FY25. It also includes new markets where export share was 0-0.1 per cent from April to November 2023 and rose to over 0.1 per cent with growth in value greater than 25 per cent in the corresponding period of FY25. Further, promising markets, where export share was 0.1-1 per cent in April to November 2023 and rose to over 1 per cent with growth in value greater than 25 per cent in April to November 2024. The size of the dot reflects the value of exports. The analysis has been done based on the data available for key Principal Commodities (PCs).

3.32  These 20 PCs were selected based on two criteria: firstly, the PCs were sorted in descending order of the number of new markets explored, and secondly, the PCs had an export value of more than USD 100 million. For instance, Chat III.15 shows that optical items had an export value of USD 16.6 million from April to November 2024 and were exported to 14 new markets (Zimbabwe, Vietnam, Tanzania, Uganda, Tunisia, Romania, Qatar, Philippines, Mozambique, Kuwait, South Korea, Iraq, Ghana, Finland). Similarly, the export of cranes, lifts and winches had a value of USD 23.1 million from April to November 2024, which has been exported to 12 new markets (Taiwan, Somalia, Portugal, Myanmar, Morocco, Madagascar, Lithuania, Jordan, Honduras, Cameroon, Armenia).  Further, office equipment &amp; medical-scientific instruments have an export value of USD 10.7 million (exported to 12 new markets) and USD 62.7 million (exported

to 9 new markets), respectively. Surgicals has also been exported to nine new markets with a total value of USD 5.4 million.

<!-- image -->

3.33 These trends reflect India's ability to maintain and even strengthen its presence in established markets. It also highlights the country's resilience and adaptability in navigating evolving global landscapes. Simultaneously, the exploration of new markets signifies a proactive approach to expanding its export reach and reducing dependency on any single market or region. This diversification strategy mitigates risks associated with market fluctuations and positions India as a more competitive player in the international trade landscape while contributing to the country's economic development.

## Services trade remained resilient amidst global challenges

3.34 Services sector exports have demonstrated resilience, while merchandise exports have witnessed moderation in recent months. They grew at 11.6 per cent in the first nine months of FY25 amidst unfavourable geopolitical conditions. The rise in services exports contributed to an increase in net services receipts from USD 120.1 billion in the first nine months of FY24 to USD 131.3 billion during the corresponding period of FY25.

<!-- image -->

3.35   Services  exports  from  India  have  shown  a  multi-sectoral  presence  in  global exports,  with  notable  contributions  across  several  sectors.  India's  share  in  global services exports has more than doubled, reaching around 4.3 per cent in 2023 from 1.9 per cent in 2005. 68    In 'Telecommunications, Computer, &amp; Information Services', India commands 10.2 per cent of the global exports market (ranking 2nd largest exporter in the world), reflecting its strong position in IT outsourcing, software development, and digital services. The 'Other Business Services sector' also plays a crucial role, with India holding 7.2 per cent of the world share (ranking 3rd largest exporter in the world), driven by its expertise in professional and consulting services. 69

3.36  'Travel' and 'Transport' services represent areas where India holds a relatively smaller share in global exports, at 2.1 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively, likely facing competition from other worldwide tourism and logistics hubs. There are opportunities for  further  growth,  especially  in  enhancing  international tourism infrastructure and global  transport  networks.  India's  financial  services  sector  lags  behind  the  global average,  highlighting  the  potential  for  growth  in  global  banking,  insurance,  and investment services. On the other hand, with a global share of 3.4 per cent in 'Personal, Cultural,  &amp;  Recreational'  services  and  3.5  per  cent  in  'Construction  services,'  India ranks 6th and 8th, respectively, demonstrating its competitive edge in cultural exports and international infrastructure projects.

3.37  India remains a global leader in IT and business services, but there is considerable untapped potential in travel, transport, and financial services. As the country becomes a  hub  for  Global  Capability  Centres  and  continues  to  innovate,  focusing  on  skill development and strategic policy interventions will be key to sustaining this momentum. Strengthening  emerging  sectors  and  improving  global  competitiveness  will  ensure

## India's e-commerce exports

3.38 The  e-commerce  industry  in  India  has  experienced  swift  expansion  over  the past  few  years,  driven  by  various  elements  such  as  the  rise  of  technology-powered advancements like online payments, localised delivery services, data-driven interactions with customers, and digital marketing. According to a report, the global B2C e-commerce market is expected to grow from USD 5.7 trillion in 2022 to USD 8.1 trillion by 2026 at a CAGR of 9.1 per cent. Correspondingly, India's B2C e-commerce market was worth USD 83 billion in 2022, and it is anticipated to grow to USD 150 billion by 2026, showing a CAGR of 15.9 per cent. 70  However, by current market size, India's e-commerce market makes up a small fraction, about 1.5 per cent of the global market, and it is projected to stay around 2 per cent in the coming years. These exports generated an estimated USD 4 to 5 billion in exports during FY23 and are expected to increase to USD 200 to USD 300 billion by 2030. 71  Box III.4 discusses the factors and policies that have played a key role in enhancing India's e-commerce exports.

## Box III. 4:  Factors driving India's e-commerce exports

Expanding data connectivity, increased penetration of smartphones, a rise in availability and use of digital wallets and safer online payments, increased customers' income levels and  growing  familiarity  with  digital  shopping  platforms  have  provided  an  impetus  to India's  e-commerce  exports.  Customers  increasingly  prefer  customised  products  from skilled artisans, and India can leverage its rich tradition of handcrafted items to meet this demand. Additionally, exporters can increase their profits by reducing costs associated with intermediaries  like  agents  and  shopkeepers,  making  e-commerce  a  lucrative  option  for selling products. 72

Government initiatives, such as Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat , have enhanced support and focus on MSMEs and e-commerce exports, thereby paving the way for more domestic sellers going global. These initiatives have provided a conducive environment for businesses to thrive and expand their reach. Recognising the relevance of e-commerce exports, the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023 has laid down provisions for fostering cross-border digital trade and promoting e-commerce and other emerging export channels. These include the Niryat Bandhu scheme 73 , financial assistance to e-commerce exporters under the Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme, export and packing credit 74 , e-commerce exporthubs 75 ,

In  the  recent  past,  various  initiatives  have  been  undertaken  by  state  governments  in collaboration  with  e-commerce  market  players  to  boost  exports.  These  have  included organising e-export Haat 80  and signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with leading e-commerce players to drive e-commerce exports, etc. 81  The Uttar Pradesh government has recently implemented measures to enhance packaging and export capabilities by leveraging design, technology, and market access. The government is also planning to set up e-commerce hubs to facilitate small producers to sell to aggregators. 82  The governmen t of Telangana has announced a new MSME policy which, inter-alia, envisages an increase in e-commerce penetration in MSMEs by encouraging the participation of sellers on the ONDC portal and GeM portal. 83

The central government's E-Commerce Export Hub (ECEH) initiative aims to revolutionise India's cross-border e-commerce. These hubs connect SMEs, artisans, and One District One Product (ODOP) producers to global markets, boosting logistics efficiency and economic inclusion in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. On the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), revised pricing slabs now cap charges at ₹3 lakh for orders above ₹10 crore, significantly reducing transaction costs. The Bharat Mart in Dubai provides Indian MSMEs affordable access to the Gulf Cooperation Council, African, and CIS markets, enhancing exports to these regions. 84

The e-commerce export ecosystem in India presents opportunities for growth alongside a few challenges related to regulatory frameworks and compliance obligations. For example, the  roles  of  sellers  and  e-commerce  platform  operators  are  not  yet  clearly  defined.  This requires collaboration between sellers and e-commerce operators at various stages of export and  payment  processes.  Presently,  exports  are  facilitated  through  two  primary  modes, courier and cargo, with a courier export value limit of USD 12,0 00 (₹1 0 lakh), which is less compared to other countries. 85

85    In the case of China, the consignment limit for e-commerce exports is USD 50,000, https://content.dgft.gov.in/ Website/EcommExportHandbokMSME\_E.pdf.

Additionally,  the  absence  of  distinct  customs  supervision  codes  for  traditional  and e-commerce exports leads to delays in customs verification, and hinders data collection for further policy interventions. 86

The RBI manages the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 1999, which requires foreign exchange receipts within nine months of shipment. This timeline supports efficient transactions  but  may  pose  challenges  for  e-commerce  operators  handling  shipments sold  over  12  to  18  months.  It  opens  the  door  to  exploring  more  flexible  reconciliation timelines. The Export Data Processing and Monitoring System (EDPMS) aids in payment reconciliation, with costs ranging from USD 18 to USD 36 (₹1,500-₹3,000). There is a need for  cost  optimisation,  particularly  for  small-value  shipments.  Additionally,  reimporting of  e-commerce  refunds/rejects  is  exempted  from  duty  only  when  it  can  be  proven  that the  reimported  goods,  are  the  same  as  those  exported,  which  is  a  cumbersome  process. Simplifying these further could improve operational efficiency. 87

India's e-commerce exports hold immense potential to grow significantly and become a key contributor to the country's GDP. Addressing some of the existing challenges can further unlock opportunities for the sector to achieve its full potential and strengthen its position among leading global e-commerce exporters.
