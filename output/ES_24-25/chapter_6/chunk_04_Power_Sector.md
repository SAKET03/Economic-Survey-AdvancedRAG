## POWER SECTOR

6.18 The power sector network continues to expand, with installed capacity rising by  7.2  per  cent  year-on-year  to  456.7  GW  as  of  November  2024.  The  addition  of transformation  capacity  also  gained  momentum  this  year  (Chart  VI.13).  However, the addition of transmission lines was affected by the heavy monsoon conditions that hampered work.

6.19 In  the  shift  towards  renewable  energy,  the  power  sector  has  been  bolstered primarily by large-scale solar and wind initiatives. By the end of December 2024, the country's total renewable energy installed capacity increased by 15.8 per cent year-onyear, reaching 209.4 GW, up from 180.8 GW in December 2023. Renewable energy now constitutes about 47 per cent of India's total installed capacity (left panel of chart VI.14) , highlighting a growing dependence on cleaner, non-fossil fuel-based energy sources.

6.20 The  Government  of  India  implemented  multiple  initiatives  aimed  at  ensuring uninterrupted power supply to every household. Under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) introduced in

2014, and the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA), introduced in 2017, about ₹1.85 lakh crore has been invested to boost distribution infrastructure across various states.  Consequently, 18,374 villages  have  been  electrified  under  DDUGJY, and 2.9 crore households have gained access to electricity through SAUBHAGYA 7 .

6.21 The government has also been implementing the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme  since  July  2021  to  enhance  the  quality  and  reliability  of  power  supply  for consumers. This initiative aims to create a financially sustainable and operationally efficient distribution sector. With a total outlay of ₹3.0 lakh crore and gross budgetary support of ₹97,631 crore allocated for the period from FY22 to FY26, projects worth ₹2.8 lakh crore have been approved to develop distribution infrastructure and implement smart metering solutions 8 .

6.22 Aided by these measures, the daily average power supply has improved from 22.1 hours in FY14 to 23.4 hours in FY24 in the urban areas and from 12.5 hours in FY14 to 21.9 hours in the rural areas. The gap between energy demand and supply has also declined from 4.2 per cent in FY14 to a mere 0.1 per cent by December 2024 9 .

## Box VI.8: Measures initiated in February 2024 to facilitate consumers

To enhance the energy infrastructure following additional measures have been undertaken to  simplify  rooftop  solar  installations,  support  EV  charging,  expedite  new  electricity connections and  facilitate better consumer experience.

- Rooftop solar PV simplification: Rules were amended in February 2024 to ease and accelerate the installation of rooftop solar systems. Approvals for systems up to 10 kW no longer require feasibility studies, and timelines for larger systems and commissioning were significantly reduced.
- EV charging connections: Consumers can now obtain separate electricity connections for charging electric vehicles, supporting India's Net Zero goal by 2070.
- Faster new connections: Timelines for  obtaining  new  electricity  connections  were reduced to three days in metropolitan areas, seven days in municipal areas, and fifteen days in rural areas.
- Consumer choice in metering: Residents of group housing societies and residential colonies  can  choose  either  individual  or  single-point  electricity  connections.  This  has promoted transparency and flexibility.
- Meter reading accuracy: If a consumer disputes their meter reading, the licensee must install  an  additional  meter  within  five  days  to  verify  consumption  over  three  months, ensuring billing accuracy.
