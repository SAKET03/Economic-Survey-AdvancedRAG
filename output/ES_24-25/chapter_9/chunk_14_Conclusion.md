## CONCLUSION

9.55 India's agricultural sector, despite encountering various challenges, remains a crucial pillar for economic growth and ensuring food security for the nation. This sector has consistently demonstrated remarkable resilience, evidenced by stable growth rates supported by a range of government initiatives to enhance productivity, diversify crop portfolios, and provide essential social security support for farmers.

9.56 The increasing significance of allied sectors, such as animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries, underscores the importance of diversification in activities and sources of income for boosting their income levels and building resilience. By tapping into these complementary  sectors,  farmers  can  create  additional  streams  of  revenue  that  can buffer them against the inherent volatility of traditional crop production.

9.57 However, the  sector  is  not  without  its  challenges.  Issues  like  climate  change and  water  scarcity  present  significant  obstacles  that  require  focused  and  targeted interventions. Promoting agricultural production patterns and practices that align with the  specific  agro-climatic  conditions  and  natural  resource  availabilities  of  different regions across the country is vital. Investment in research and development, especially on climate-resistant varieties, improved agriculture practices, diversification to highyield and climate-resilient crops, and micro-irrigation, can yield sustainable long-term benefits.  The  widespread  adoption  of  digital  technologies  in  agriculture  will  unlock further possibilities for enhancing productivity.

9.58 Improving price discovery and market efficiency is another critical aspect that necessitates attention. Strengthening market infrastructure is essential to facilitate this improvement. This can be achieved by effectively utilising the e-NAM, a platform for farmers to access broader markets. Furthermore, supporting the establishment and operational capabilities of FPOs and enabling cooperatives to play a more active and influential role in agricultural markets is paramount to fostering an inclusive market environment.

9.59 Government initiatives like PM-KISAN, which provides direct income support to farmers, and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY), which offers pension schemes  for  farmers,  have  successfully  contributed  to  bolstering  farmers'  incomes and enhancing their social security safety nets. More than 11 crore farmers have been benefitted under PM-KISAN and 23.61 lakh farmers had enrolled under PMKMY as of 31st October 2024. In addition to these efforts, reforms such as e-KYC compliance under the ONORC initiative and credit guarantee schemes for e-NWR financing address systemic inefficiencies that have historically plagued the agricultural sector.

9.60 Moreover, there is a concerted focus on modernising food grain storage systems, particularly in remote and hilly areas, which reflects a strong commitment to improving the overall supply chain infrastructure.

9.61 While  various  initiatives  have  helped  India's  agriculture  and  allied  services  to grow under challenging circumstances, the good news is that there is still significant

untapped growth potential. The right set of policies across all levels of government can reduce the overproduction of cereals and address the underproduction of pulses and edible oil. For instance, India's farmers must be allowed to receive price signals from the market unimpeded, with separate mechanisms designed to take care of the cost-ofliving impact on deserving households for specified durations. Two, they need to have market mechanisms to hedge their price risks. Three, they need the right policies that nudge them away from impairing their soil fertility with an unbalanced application of  fertilisers  and  from  producing already overproduced crops, which deplete India's water  resources  and  use  up  electricity  excessively.  These  policy  shifts  will  help  lift agricultural productivity in the economy by boosting land and labour productivity in the sector. Consistent and stable growth of agriculture at around 5 per cent, with a 20 per cent share of overall GVA in the economy, will contribute 1 per cent growth to GVA. Agriculture will then absorb surplus labour even as output per worker and output per hectare rise. Agro-based entrepreneurship will flourish even more than it already does. In the process, India will not only achieve food security for itself but will also enable it for other nations too. The possibilities are both exciting and limitless.
