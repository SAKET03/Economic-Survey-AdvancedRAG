## SERVICES: NEW CHALLENGES FOR THE OLD WAR HORSE

CHAPTER

08

The  service  sector  has  been  fuelling  growth  both  domestically  and  globally. In  FY25  so  far,  services  propped  up  GDP  growth  when  manufacturing  has been  affected  by  dampening  global  merchandise  trade.  The  critical  role  of services exports in strengthening India's external balance and the increasing 'servicification'  of  the  industrial  sector  adds  to  its  importance  to  the  Indian economy. Logistics services have regained their pre-pandemic momentum and are enhancing the user experience through digitisation. India continues to be an important partner in the changing global technology landscape through the adoption of digital technologies in business processes. Initiatives such as Open Network  for  Digital  Commerce  (ONDC)  are  making  these  transformations more inclusive. Equipping the labour force with requisite skills and creating an enabling environment through simple and transparent processes of grassroots level governance will go a long way in realising the full potential of commercial services and building resilience to global headwinds.

## INTRODUCTION

8.1 Services value added accounts for about 62 per cent of the global GDP 1 . Services have been the growth engine for middle-income countries like China, Thailand, and India in the last decade. Presently, the Euro area is reeling under a slowdown but is expected  to  improve  in  2025  on  the  back  of  improving  services  activity.  However, higher  nominal  wage  growth  compared  to  pre-pandemic  wage  growth  has  kept service inflation high. This has caused the current cycle of global disinflation to slow down 2 .

8.2 The Global Services PMI Business Activity Index rose to a four month high of 53.8 in  December  2024.  This  signals  expansion  for  the  twenty-third  consecutive  month. Growth  of  new  order  intakes  and  employment  also  strengthened,  while  business sentiment edged higher 3 . However, global supply chains continue to face significant disruptions due to geo-political uncertainty, i.e., the rise of protectionism, wars, and

8.3 India's  share  in  global  services  exports  has  been  steadily  rising  for  the  last two  decades.  This  has  helped  compensate  the  impact  of  oscillation  in  the  share  of merchandise exports in global merchandise exports to some extent. In 2023, the United States led global services exports with a dominant 13 per cent share, followed by the United Kingdom with 7.4 per cent, Germany with 5.5 per cent and Ireland, China, and France, each accounting for approximately 5 per cent. India ranks seventh globally, representing a 4.3 per cent share in the global services export.

## SERVICES SECTOR PERFORMANCE IN INDIA

8.4 India's services sector has been the steadiest contributor to the gross value added (GVA) in the economy. Its contribution to the total GVA at current prices has increased from 50.6 per cent in FY14 to about 55 per cent in FY25. It also provides employment to approximately 30 per cent of the workforce. Services also contribute indirectly to the GDP through the servicification of manufacturing, i.e., increasing utilization of services in manufacturing production and post-production value addition 4 .

<!-- image -->

8.5 The growth in the service sector, as measured by YoY change in the real GVA by services, has been above six per cent in each year in the last decade, except for the Covid-19 pandemic that affected FY21. The average services growth rate before the prepandemic year was eight per cent. The average services growth in the post-pandemic year i.e. FY23 to FY25 has risen to 8.3 per cent.

8.6 The  service  sector  is  divided  into  the  following  sub-sectors:  (i)  trade,  repair, hotels  and  restaurants,  (ii)  transport,  storage,  communication  &amp;  services  related to  broadcasting,  (iii)  financial  services,  (iv)  real  estate,  ownership  of  dwelling  &amp; professional services, (v) public administration and (v) other services.

8.7 Within  the  service  sector,  public  administration  services  have  accounted  for  a share in the range of 11-12 per cent of the total services GVA during FY13 to FY23. Information and computer related services had the maximum buoyancy among the

services during the last decade (FY13 to FY23) which grew at a trend rate of 12.8 per cent during the last decade and stepped up its share in overall GVA from 6.3 per cent in FY13 to 10.9 per cent in FY23. This service has shown outstanding resilience both during and after the pandemic.

## Purchasing manager's index (PMI)- services

8.8 HSBC's  India  services  PMI  shows  that  the  service  sector  remained  in  the expansionary zone for continuous 41 months since August 2021. The index remained above the 60 mark for the first five months of FY25. However, in September, the index witnessed  a  ten-month  low,  but  it  quickly  rebounded  in  October.  The  recent  data 5 indicates  demand  buoyancy  continued  to  drive  new  business  inflows  higher,  which in  turn  supported output growth and prompted firms to recruit additional workers. Finance &amp; insurance registered strongest increases in both new orders and business activity at the sub-sector level.

Note: The index varies between 0 and 100, with a reading above 50 indicating an overall increase compared to the previous month and below 50, an overall decrease.

## Trade in the services

8.9 The export of services grew at a trend rate of 11 per cent during FY14 to FY23, at constant prices. Computer services and business services exports account for around 70  per  cent  of  India's  services  exports.  India  remained  amongst  the  top  five  major countries in terms of growth in services exports in FY25 (April-September) 6 . India's services export growth accelerated to 12.8 per cent in April-November FY25 from 5.7 per cent in FY24. In April-November FY25, services imports grew by 13.9 per cent, in contrast to a decline of 2.9 per cent during the same period in FY24.

## PROGRESS IN LOGISTICS AND PHYSICAL CONNECTIVITYBASED SERVICES

## Indian Railways: keeping the development on track

8.12  Indian Railways (IR) is the fourth largest network in the world. Passenger traffic originating  in  IR  achieved  a  growth  of  8  per  cent  over  the  previous  year.  Revenueearning freight in FY24, achieved a growth of 5.2 per cent.

<!-- image -->

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;

8.13  In view of the rising passenger traffic, the government is taking various steps to upgrade passenger amenities. Out of a total of 7,325 railway stations across the nation, train indication boards have been provided at 1351 stations, coach guidance systems at 866 stations, digital clocks at 5605 stations, and public address systems at 6071 stations as of November 2024. Wi-Fi facility has been provided at 6112 stations to date. A new policy for the management of mobile catering services was introduced in 2023. As of date, 557 base kitchens have been commissioned catering to 468 pairs of trains.

8.14  As a result of the push toward digitalization in IR, E-ticketing has touched 86 per cent in the reserved sector as of October 2024. Ticketing through digital means in the unreserved sector has increased from 28 per cent at the beginning of the current financial  year  to  around  33  per  cent  in  October  2024.  IR  has  also  transformed  the refund process enabling refunds in eligible cases within 24 hours in around 98 per cent of cases. Dynamic QR code-based payment has been enabled across all the counters. The passenger reservation system is being redeveloped using cloud-native technologies.

The new application will have features like high scalability, high performance, high availability, high level of security, ease of operations, and high agility.

8.15   To  encourage  tourism,  Bharat  gaurav  trains  have  been  introduced  as  themebased tourist circuit trains that showcase India's rich cultural heritage and magnificent historical places. Under this scheme, the service provider is to provide comprehensive tour  services  comprising  meals,  accommodation,  transport,  sightseeing,  tour  guide, etc. As of date, a total of 325 trips of Bharat gaurav trains carrying 1,91,033 tourists have been operated covering various tourist destinations.

## Road transport

8.16   Road  transport  generates  the  highest  GVA  within  transport  services.  During FY23, road transport accounted for 78 per cent of the total GVA of transport services. Enhancing user  convenience  on  national  highways  is  central  to  the  growth  of  road transport.  In this direction, the government has moved from traditional ways of tolling to  digitised  tolling  by  adopting  electronic  toll  collection  through  FASTag.  This  has reduced the average waiting time at toll plazas from 734 seconds to 47 seconds 10 . The government has targeted the rollout of barrier-free tolling on all four lane plus NHs and high-speed corridors by FY29. The government has planned to establish more than one thousand wayside amenities in the next five years to provide world-class facilities and amenities to highway users in line with global standards along the NHs at every 40-60 kms on both sides.

8.17   In  a  major  step  towards  road  safety,  the  government  has  formulated  a comprehensive strategy to improve road safety standards on NHs. A cashless treatment scheme for road accident victims has been initiated. Institute of driving training and research, regional driving training centres, and driving training centres at the state/ district level have been set up. The government is also working towards road safety through  initiatives  like  supporting  truck  driver  health  with  the  Abhay  project,  and providing eye tests and health checks for drivers.

## Aviation: flying high

8.18   India  is  the  fastest-growing  aviation  market  globally.  To  accommodate  the substantial growth in air traffic, Indian airlines have placed amongst the largest orders for aircraft globally.

<!-- image -->

8.19   In  the  sphere  of  the  maintenance,  repair,  and  overhaul  (MRO)  industry,  the government is encouraging original equipment manufacturers to establish facilities in India and has introduced policies to align the sector with global standards.

## Box VIII.2: New segments - drones, leasing and MRO

- As of October 31, 2024, India has seen a notable rise in drone activities, with 140 remote pilot  training  organisations,  18,862  remote  pilot  certificates  issued,  26,659  registered drones, and 82 approved drone models (DGCA type certificates). About ₹ 60.6 crore have been disbursed under the PLI scheme to support drone manufacturing.
- As  of  November  30,  2024,  32  aircraft  leasing  entities  (including  provisional)  have registered  in  the  GIFT-IFSC,  leasing  105  aviation  assets,  including  53  aircraft  and  52 engines.
- On July  12,  2024,  the  government  announced  a  uniform  5  per  cent  integrated  goods and  services  tax  on  imported  aircraft  parts  and  tools,  applicable  regardless  of  HSN classification.

8.20 The PM Gati Shakti initiative aims to create a seamless multimodal connectivity network across the country. Under this initiative, the aviation sector is being integrated with other modes of transport, such as railways, roads, and waterways.

## Real Estate: Building the economy

8.26  India's real estate market witnessed robust performance under office demand as well as residential sales driven by economic stability and positive market sentiment. After the enactment of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority, India ranked 31st out of 89 countries in the Global Real Estate Transparency Index in 2024 11 . The demand for real estate is emerging not only in tier 1 and tier 2 cities but across the country due to the expansion of metro networks, enhancement to road networks, and improvements in  connectivity.  Housing  demand  in  India  is  expected  to  touch  93  million  units  by 2036 12 . The rise of real estate investment trusts (REITs) further amplifies the positive trajectory of the commercial sector.  The residential real estate market scaled an 11-year high in sales volume in the first six months of 2024. During this period, total sale across top eight cities recorded 11 per cent YoY growth 13 .

<!-- image -->

8.27   The  Real  Estate  (Regulation  and  Development)  Act  has  brought  numerous improvements in the real estate sector, including protection against fraud, increased transparency,  timely  project  deliveries,  and  measures  to  prevent  misuse  of  funds, among other benefits. GST has helped to simplify the taxation structure in real estate transactions by applying a single unified tax system across states. It has encouraged proper  invoicing  and  documentation,  thus  reducing  the  scope  for  tax  evasion.  The government  introduced  REITs  as  an  investment  vehicle  in  commercial  real  estate, allowing investors to pool funds and invest in income-generating real estate. This helps increase commercial real estate market liquidity and attracts institutional investors. Implementation of online platforms for the submission and approval of building plans has led to a reduction in delays and brought more transparency to the process. The

8.34   There  has  been  a  paradigm  shift  in  India's  telecom  technology  space  that underscores an ongoing effective transition from a technology importer to a technology developer and exporter.

## Box VIII.4: C-DOT- the catalyst of India's telecom revolution

The Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) has been committed to research and development of indigenous solutions and reducing dependency on foreign technologies.

C-DOT has consistently spearheaded next-generation telecom technologies:

4G  and  5G  core  networks: C-DOT has  been  instrumental  in  developing  indigenous 4G and 5G core solutions, reducing reliance on global vendors and helping in reduction of  telecom imports. Its innovations support the deployment of secure, scalable networks tailored to India's needs.

Quantum communication systems: Recognising the rising importance of cybersecurity, C-DOT has developed quantum encryption solutions, ensuring secure communication for government and strategic sectors.

Disaster management solutions: Technologies like geo-targeted and automated multihazard,  multi-media  early  warning  alerts  to  citizens  have  reinforced  India's  resilience against natural disasters.

Cybersecurity  and  resilience: As  telecom  infrastructure  evolves,  so  do  the  threats. C-DOT  has  developed  indigenous  cybersecurity  tools  that  monitor  and  protect  critical infrastructure. These tools are pivotal in mitigating risks associated with cyber warfare and ensuring national security. C-DoT has developed the SAMVAD app to provide secure call and chat for sharing text, image, audio, and video files and deployed in strategic organizations.

Uplifting  domestic  telecom  ecosystem: Through  its  CCRP  (C-DOT  Collaborative Research  Program),  C-DOT  fosters  indigenous  telecom  innovation  by  partnering  with industry  players.  This  initiative  strengthens  India's  telecom  research  ecosystem,  with C-DOT offering funding and expertise to help companies develop advanced technologies. C-DOT also supports startups incubated under the CCRP framework.

C-DOT's journey can exemplify India's transition from a telecom consumer to a technology innovator, propelling the nation towards a future of digital sovereignty and inclusive connectivity.

## Box VIII.5: Open Network for Digital Commerce: thinking beyond platforms

The  pandemic  underscored  the  critical  role  of  digital  commerce  in  enabling  business continuity  and  consumer  access  to  essentials.  Digital  commerce  played  role  in  enabling resilience  in  the  economy.  The  prevailing  platform-centric  model  of  digital  commerce globally,  and  increasingly  in  India,  calls  for  attention.  A  few  large  e-commerce  players dominate the market, which affects participation and flexibility of smaller sellers, such as local retailers, artisans, and MSMEs. Sellers often have to conform to terms and conditions, from customer data access to product visibility, reducing their market leverage and fostering dependence on these platforms.

The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) represents a paradigm shift, promoting a democratic and interoperable digital commerce ecosystem thus fostering inclusivity and equity. ONDC enables buyers and sellers to transact seamlessly across different platforms. It  helps  by  reducing  customer  acquisition  costs,  enhancing  business  efficiencies,  and expanding choices for merchants and consumers.

ONDC recorded more than 14 million transactions in the month of November 2024 across 1100+ cities. 7 lakh+ sellers and service providers are active on the ONDC network spread across 600+ cities and towns across India. 190+ network participants are live on the network. Presently, over 7000 farmer producer organisations (FPOs) have registered to be a part of the ONDC network through various seller network participants. Around 400 self-help groups (SHGs), micro-entrepreneurs, and social sector enterprises have been onboarded on the network. Mobility through the ONDC network is live in 15+ cities with around 5.45 lakh taxi and auto drivers onboarded.

<!-- image -->

## Scaling new frontiers: thinking beyond traditional e-commerce

Logistics as a service: ONDC is integrating  hyperlocal  and  inter-city  logistics  service providers to ensure a seamless supply chain with unified first-mile, middle mile, and lastmile connectivity across 1200+ cities.

Financial services: ONDC's financial services category was launched in August 2024. It  integrated  with  9  lending  service  providers  applications  and  3  lenders,  to  enhance accessibility  and  efficiency  in  credit  services.

## STATE WISE ANALYSIS OF SERVICE SECTOR PERFORMANCE

8.35   The context for presenting the state-specific patterns in industrial and service gross state value added (GSVA) 19   has been mentioned in Chapter 7 of this Survey. The service sector accounts for about 55 per cent of the national GVA in FY25. However, the  distribution  of  service  sector  activity  across  Indian  states  reveals  a  pronounced geographic dispersion. For FY23, Karnataka and Maharashtra account for more than one fourth of the total service sector GSVA of all the states. These states along with Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat together share more than 50 per cent of the total service sector GSVA. These states also have more than 50 per cent of the total industrial GSVA, suggesting that both feed into each other. On the other hand, another set of  19 states collectively account for only one fourth of the service sector GSVA of all the states (Chart VIII.21).

8.36  Among the different service activities, public administration is a unique category that reflects the strength of the state machinery in the state. This is majorly determined by the strength of state's own revenues, central transfers including tax devolution and

These GSVA numbers are estimated by the respective State Directorates of Economics &amp; Statistics and hosted by MoSPI.

borrowing of the state, which together define the spending capacity of the state. This is independent of other services which are largely commercially driven.

8.37  The economies of many north eastern states have considerable dependence on the resources of the state and central government because there are natural disadvantages to those regions to pursue large-scale industrialisation and commercial services. (Chart VIII.22)

8.38  There are four different scenarios in the relationship between services share in total GSVA (defined as service intensity of the state economy), and, services GSVA per capita.

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;

- i.  low service intensity, low per capita service GSVA;
- ii.  low service intensity, high per capita service GSVA;
- iii.  high service intensity, low per capita service GSVA; and,
- iv.  high service intensity, high per capita service GSVA.

8.39   Category  (ii)  above  indicates  that  the  productivity  of  commercial  services  is high.  In  contrast,  category  (iii)  represents  high  dependence  on  commercial  service activities without their being productive enough to generate high levels of income. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn from states falling in the other two categories without analysing supplementary information. However, in category (iv), some state patterns are  very  clear-Karnataka's,  and  to  an  extent,  Telangana's  positions  are  majorly explained by the large presence of IT services, Maharashtra's position is largely due to its strength of financial intermediation activities, and, Kerala's position mainly because of the strong presence of trade, financial and real estate services. The following three charts present service activities that constitute more than two-thirds of the total services GSVA net of public administration. These three charts provide some explanation for the patterns seen in Chart VIII.23.

8.40   The states like Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, and Mizoram have more than a third of their services GSVA coming from trade, repair, hotels, and restaurants, partly because of  tourism. Many bigger states have trade and repair intensity of close to or higher than the national average indicating a large presence of low value adding trade in these states. Many of these states are relatively less industrialised also (Refer Chapter 7).

8.41     Financial,  real  estate  and  professional  services  have  very  high  levels  of  concentration in a few states. Within the service sector, financial services are highly concentrated with Maharashtra (Mumbai), Tamil Nadu, Gujarat (GIFT City) and Karnataka accounting for more than 50 per cent of total financial services GSVA.  (Maharashtra is not presented in the chart because it is a big positive outlier).

8.42   Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Telangana,  Haryana,  Tamil  Nadu  have  more  than one  third  of  their  services  GSVA  coming  from  real  estate,  ownership  of  dwelling  &amp; professional services. (Karnataka is not presented in the chart because it is a positive outlier). Karnataka (Bengaluru), Telangana (Hyderabad) and Maharashtra (Mumbai), Haryana (Gurugram) and Tamil Nadu (Chennai) have concentration of IT and fintech services leading to high demand for office and residential space.

8.43  Chart VIII.27 combines the state patterns flowing from this chapter and chapter 7. (Sikkim and Goa are not presented here because they are outliers). It largely indicates the comparative advantages of different states.

8.44   On  the  basis  of  the  above  analysis,  states  can  be  classified  into  four  distinct categories based on their service and industrial performance in terms of per capita GSVA.

- i. States  with  high  per  capita  industrial  GSVA:  These  are  states  like  Gujarat, Uttarakhand,  and  Himachal  Pradesh.  States  like  Chhattisgarh  and  Odisha perform reasonably well in the industrial sector while they have low service sector presence. This indicates that these states will stand to gain largely by accelerating their industrialisation and industrial productivity which will strengthen their  service  sectors  through  the  ongoing  trends  in  greater  'servicification'  of industries. 20
- ii. Strong  service  sector  performers:  States  such  as  Karnataka,  Telangana  and Kerala excel in services, with high per-capita service GSVA and service shares in GSVA but exhibit only around average industrial per capita GSVA. These regions largely depend on urbanised service-driven economies.
- iii.    Dual strengths-industrial and service: Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu typically represent  states  with  reasonably  strong  industrial  and  service  sectors.  Their diversified  economies  integrate  manufacturing  with  trade,  financial  services, real estate &amp; professional services.
- iv. States  with  reform  potential:  While  the  need  for  business  reforms  cuts  across  states in general, the fourth category specifically includes states that have significant potential for reform led development. These states are Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh,  Jharkhand,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Manipur,  Meghalaya,  Nagaland, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

8.45  As per DPIIT's Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP) 21 , which ranks states based on their performance in introducing business reforms, the states with service intensity backed by industry are the states which have introduced larger numbers of reforms in comparison to their peer states and fall in top achiever and achiever's category. Thus, introducing business reforms is essential to industrial as well as service development in the state.

8.46  As per annual survey of unincorporated sector enterprises 2022-23, the number of estimated enterprises belonging to the unincorporated sector stands at 6.5 crore. 72.6 per cent of these enterprises operate in the service sector. Many states like Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have a substantial presence of these enterprises. These enterprises, though contributing to the overall development of the economy in terms of employment and income, are losing out on benefits normally offered by incorporation such as tax benefits, and credibility which could help them build better client relationships, access

to credit and durability which would help them provide continuity to their business operations  etc.  States,  through  policy  nudges  reducing  compliance  difficulties,  can accelerate the incorporation of these enterprises.

## CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD

8.47  In the Economic Survey 2023-24, we reported that two significant transformations are reshaping India's services landscape: the rapid technology-driven transformation of domestic service delivery and the diversification of India's services exports. At the helm of this change are financial and professional services. In the first half of FY25, about 45 per cent of the total service sector GVA growth in India was due to financial, real estate, rental and professional services; almost as much as they did during the last decade. Globally, services are presently shoring up growth even in countries where there is a manufacturing slowdown inflicted by moderation in merchandise trade buoyancy. This presents an upside of possibilities to services exports and hence domestic services output.

8.48  At the same time, new risks have surfaced in the growth of IT and professional services in view of the recent changes in global policies following key electoral outcomes. Regulators, have expressed concerns about the potential impact of offshore work on the quality of audits. The general concerns expressed seem to stem from the breakdown of traditional apprenticeship model, inadequate direct supervision, language barriers and inability  to  communicate  instructions  effectively  in  complex  cases,  information gaps of the remote auditors, risks of loss of confidentiality and differences in regulatory provisions  in  the  countries  involved,  resulting  in  compliance  gaps.  These  perceived risks present a downside risk to export-led services growth.

8.49   Domestically,  the  embedded  service  content  of  the  non-service  economic activities has increased significantly, as evidenced by the National Accounts Statistics. There is also growing literature emphasising the 'servicification' of manufacturing, i.e., increasing  utilization  of  services  in  manufacturing  production  and  post-production value addition 22 .  This means that growth in manufacturing has a significant bearing on service sector growth, and vice versa. At the same time, the increasing penetration of digital technologies and artificial intelligence in manufacturing and service sector activities  like  finance,  retail  and  commerce,  telecom,  and,  transport  and  logistics  is changing the very composition of demand for embedded services.

8.50  This picture of the emerging services landscape auto-generates two conclusions. First,  it  is  widely  believed  that  the  manpower  (and  sectors)  with  suitable  digital

and technical skills stand to benefit from AI penetration. Hence, one of the primary conditions for manufacturing and service sector progress is the focus on appropriate skilling of the labour force. The significant initiatives taken in the Budget 2024-25 need to be carried forward into action by the synergic efforts of all tiers of the government, private sector and skilling institutions. Second, there is an urgent need to review and amend complicated procedures at the grassroot level, regulations and rules that hinder both manufacturing and services. Chapter 5 offers several suggestions in this regard. These will help build resilience against the likely persistent global headwinds.
