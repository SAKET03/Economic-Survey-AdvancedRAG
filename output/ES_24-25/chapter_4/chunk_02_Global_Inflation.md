## GLOBAL INFLATION

## Global resilience amid synchronised monetary policy tightening

4.4.  Despite the sharp and synchronised tightening of monetary policy across countries, the global economy has demonstrated an unusual level of resilience in output growth throughout the disinflationary process. This resilience is reflected in the steady decline of the headline inflation rate in most countries during FY24 and the current year. The concerted efforts by central banks to curb inflation through increased interest rates and other policy measures have yielded positive outcomes, resulting in a significant reduction in inflationary pressures.

## Decline in core inflation

4.5.  In alignment with the downward trend in headline inflation, core inflation, which excludes  volatile  food  and  energy  prices  has  also  decreased  in  most  countries.  The decline can be predominantly attributed to a moderation in international commodity prices.  This  trend  highlights  the  effectiveness  of  policy  interventions  in  stabilising prices across various sectors.

## Global food inflation eases with divergence in a few EMEs

4.6.  Global food inflation is on a downward trend, aligning with the patterns observed in both headline and core inflation. Improving global supply conditions due to solid harvests  and  favourable  growing  conditions  contributed  to  the  softening  of  food prices 2 . However, some emerging economies, such as Brazil, India, and China have a contrasting pattern.
