## RISKS PERTAINING TO INDIA'S FINANCIAL SECTOR

2.86    The  Indian  financial  sector  is  currently  at  a  pivotal  moment.  The  traditional dominance of banks in providing credit is beginning to decline, and other participants and products in the financial sector are increasingly filling this role. This shift is a longawaited and positive development for a country that aims to become a developed nation by 2047. Various financial innovations such as UPI, Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) and T+1 settlement have significantly eased access to credit in India. A recent

initiative by the RBI, the Unified Lending Interface (ULI), can potentially be a gamechanger in MSME financing.

2.87  While there is evidence of increasing reliance on the financial markets as a funding source, the financial markets must work in tandem with the banking sector to bridge the  capital  requirement  gap.  The  financial  markets  must  grow  in  line  with,  but  not faster than, the economy's capital needs and overall economic growth. As the country undergoes  this  significant  transformation,  it  is  crucial  to  be  aware  of  the  potential vulnerabilities that may arise. India must prepare itself with appropriate regulatory and government policy measures to intervene and mitigate these risks when necessary. Additionally, banks need to enhance their capabilities to meet the demands of new-age households and the digital economy while maintaining their primary credit creation function. Excessive financialisation can hurt the economy. The costs may be particularly high for a low-middle-income country like India. Box II.5 discusses this in detail.

## Box II.5: Can the growth of the financial sector come at a cost?

Lessons from the global financial crisis of 2008 reveal that uninhibited financial sector growth can come with a cost to the real economy. Till the run-up to the crisis, however, conventional wisdom dictated that the financial sector performed best when deregulated. 93   To sustain financial growth but prevent a crisis, regulators must be sensitive to the nuanced relationship between financial sector growth and the real economy.

## Financial sector and the real economy - relationship

A developed financial system reduces transaction costs, allows better price discovery, and channels  the  flow  of  capital  into  innovative  and  risky  economic  activities.  Research  has established that finance is a causal driver of growth, not a by-product of the development process. 94  There is evidence that finance aids consumption smoothing and allows firms and households to absorb shocks. 95  Finance is essential for poverty and inequality reduction. 96 However, there is an inflexion point at which financial development switches from propelling growth to holding it back. For instance, BIS research shows that Ireland's steep rise in private credit to GDP ratio from 90 per cent in the 1990s to 150 per cent in 2007 shaved away 0.5 percentage points from productivity growth. 97  In contrast, by reducing its private credit to GDP during the Asian financial crisis, Thailand contributed to its productivity growth by 0.5 percentage points.

93    After the crisis erupted, Former Fed Governor Alan Greenspan admitted that he "made a mistake" in trusting that free markets could regulate themselves without government oversight.

When the economy reaches a state of 'over-finance', the financial sector would compete with the real sector for resources. This competition for resources is especially seen in the case of skilled labour, which gets absorbed into the financial sector at the cost of the real economy. 98   Often financial sector innovation may result in products that do not add value to the real economy. Research also shows that rapid financial sector growth tends to favour high collateral-low productivity projects. 99  Often, financial booms are associated with the growth of sectors such as construction, where the collateral is high, but productivity growth is relatively low.

Greater  levels  of  financial  engineering  can  create  complex  products  whose  risks  are  not apparent to the regular consumer. At the same time, these products are designed so that the lenders have little 'skin in the game'. 100   Ultimately, the proliferation of such products can lead to an event such as the financial crisis of 2008. In the run-up to the crisis, mortgages were granted to people with little ability to pay them back. In turn, lenders reduced their exposure to risk  by  securitising  these  mortgages  at  multiple  stages.  When  the  mortgage bubble burst, it, in turn, took down with it instruments that were highly securitised, leading to the crises.

The  changing  influence  of  financial  development  on  growth  can  be  depicted  as  a  bellshaped relationship. 101   As research by the IMF shows, several developed nations, such as Ireland, the USA, and Japan, are past the point where incremental advances in the financial sector can contribute to growth. 102   In contrast, under-developed and developing countries such as Gambia, Ecuador and Morocco reap dividends to growth through faster financial development.

## Sustaining financial development while mitigating financial stability risks role of regulation

Can  a  developing  economy  (nations  to  the  left  of  the  peak  of  the  bell  curve)  reach  a point of over-finance such that advancements to the financial sector hamper its growth prospects? In the presence of weak institutions and poor regulatory quality, it is possible for an emerging economy to reach well past its optimal level of financial development. 103 Thus, the upper bound to financial development is fixed by the regulatory quality of the emerging market.

As the regulatory quality in the financial sector improves, regulators will need to play a delicate balancing act between the goals of financial resilience and growth. On the one hand, building  financial  resilience  would  entail  higher  capital  buffers,  stricter  regulations  and reduced risk-taking. On the other hand, this would lead to lower financial growth by limiting profitable investments and innovation. For instance, a system where banks maintain high reserve  ratios  and  only  lend  to  the  most  creditworthy  borrowers  may  exclude  smaller households and businesses from accessing credit.

Managing the trade-offs between financial resilience and efficiency is especial significant for  EMEs,  which  have  two  undertake  large-scale  financial  inclusion  and,  at  the  same time, reduce there vulnerability to crises. In this context, regulatory innovations that use technology  such  as  unified  ledgers  and  digital  infrastructure  can  help  advance  financial efficiency  without  compromising  on  resilience.  EMEs  such  as  Brazil  and  Thailand  were making positive steps towards advancing such as technology in there financial system. 104  In India's case, innovations such as the OCEN framework and the ULI provide access to realtime information on the risk profiles of debtors and reduce the need for provisioning based on an overestimation of default risk.
