11.111  The Indian economy's growth story emphasises a welfare-enhancement approach by  the  government,  focusing  on  empowering  all  citizens  and  ensuring  the  efficient delivery of welfare measures. The government's initiatives aim to provide opportunities

198  So far, 9186 BFTs have been trained in 20 States.

199 A  total  of  2,00,000  beneficiaries  to  be  trained  till  March  2025  with  an  estimated  financial  expenditure  of Rs.307.34 Crore. A total of 73,628 beneficiaries have been trained till 30th September 2025.

for everyone, enabling them to achieve their professional and personal goals. With the focus on education, health, skilling, and innovation, with improved social and economic infrastructure the aim is to achieve welfare for all.

11.112   While the education and health system has made significant progress through various initiatives aimed at achieving national goals, there is a critical need to enhance the delivery mechanisms. By rethinking and improving these systems and integrating innovation and technologies, one can ensure that benefits effectively reach the last mile and are fully realised by those who need them most.

11.113    The  importance of focusing on learning outcomes is underscored by reports revealing the gap between class standards and actual learning levels. To address this gap and enhance learning outcomes, it is crucial to implement innovative teaching methods and strategies that prioritise peer learning, social and emotional development, digital literacy, and life skills. These approaches will not only boost academic performance but also foster cognitive and critical thinking skills among students.

11.114   Policymaking in India emphasises preventive health to enhance life expectancy, quality  of  life,  and  economic  growth  through  lower  healthcare  costs  and  improved productivity.  The  National  Health  Policy  2017  advocates  universal  health  coverage, affordable  care,  and  prevention  of  NCDs.  Advancements  in  physical  and  digital infrastructure, including eSanjeevani, UWIN, NDHM, drones, and AI, have improved healthcare  access,  particularly  in  underserved  areas.  Mental  health  initiatives  and strategies to promote healthier lifestyles are crucial for addressing NCDs and boosting productivity.

11.115    The  government's  focus  on  rural  infrastructure,  housing,  and  livelihoods reflects a comprehensive 'welfare for all' approach. By improving rural connectivity, sanitation, housing, access to drinking water, and social inclusion, alongside supporting microfinance,  SHGs,  and  localisation  of  SDGs,  these  initiatives  ensure  inclusive development.  Together,  they  uplift  rural  communities,  bridging  gaps  in  equity  and quality of life.

11.116    Regulatory institutions in the areas of health and education must constantly balance the needs of the society and that of the ease of provision of such services by the  providers.  Where  the  market  can  do  an  effective  job,  regulations  can  either  be withdrawn or compliance made voluntary with disclosure. Tight regulations increase the compliance and supervision burden on state capacity that is already stretched. This gives rise to unfulfilled expectations on the part of the public. Therefore, for India to receive the demographic dividend in full in the coming years, regulatory institutions need  to  evolve  to  focus  on  allowing  outcomes  to  happen  without  being  fixated  on

inputs. Trust-based regulation backed up by transparency and disclosure on the part of the regulated deserves a chance. Regulators must develop their assessment parameters and report on their own effectiveness transparently.  There is no better way to demand right behaviour than to set an example.
