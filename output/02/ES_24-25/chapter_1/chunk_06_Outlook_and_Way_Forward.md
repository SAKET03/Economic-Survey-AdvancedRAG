# Outlook and Way Forward

## OUTLOOK AND WAY FORWARD

1.68 A steady growth trajectory shapes the global economic outlook for 2024, though regional patterns vary. The near-term global growth is expected to be a shade lower than  the  trend  level.  The  services  sector  continues  to  drive  global  expansion,  with notable resilience in India. Meanwhile, manufacturing is struggling in Europe, where structural weaknesses persist. Trade outlook also remains clouded in the next year.

1.69 Inflationary  pressures  have  been  easing  globally,  though  risks  of  synchronised price pressures linger due to potential geopolitical disruptions, such as tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Central banks have adopted more accommodative monetary policies. However, the pace of rate cuts varies across regions depending on the growth imperatives and the pace of disinflation, creating potential divergences in economic recovery.

1.70 On the domestic front, rebounding rural demand augurs well for consumption. Investment  activity  is  expected  to  pick  up,  supported  by  higher  public  capex  and improving business expectations. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing remains above the  long-term  average,  and  private  sector  order  books  have  shown  steady  growth, alongside a rise in investment intentions. However, these gains could be tempered by the global excess capacities in sectors such as steel, leading to aggressive trade policies in search of demand.

1.71  Going forward, food inflation is likely to soften in Q4 FY25 with the seasonal easing of vegetable prices and Kharif harvest arrivals. Good Rabi production is likely to contain food prices in the first half of FY26. Adverse weather events and rise in international agricultural commodity prices, however, pose risks to food inflation. Global energy and commodity prices have softened in the recent past, making the core inflation outlook benign. However, risks remain on account of significant global political and economic uncertainties.

1.72  In  brief,  there  are  many  upsides  to  domestic  investment,  output  growth  and disinflation in FY26. There are equally strong, prominently extraneous, downsides too.

Nonetheless, the fundamentals of the domestic economy remain robust, with a strong external account, calibrated fiscal consolidation and stable private consumption. On balance of these considerations, we expect that the growth in FY26 would be between 6.3 and 6.8 per cent.

1.73  Navigating global headwinds will require strategic and prudent policy management and  reinforcing  the  domestic  fundamentals.  The  Budget  2024-25  laid  out  a  multisectoral policy agenda for sustained growth push. In this context, Chapter 5 elaborates on the need for deregulation and reforms at the grassroots level to improve the overall competitiveness of the economy and to lift trend growth rates, supporting higher levels of economic activity.
