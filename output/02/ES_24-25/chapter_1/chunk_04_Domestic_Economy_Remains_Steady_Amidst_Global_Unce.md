# Domestic Economy Remains Steady Amidst Global Uncertainties

## DOMESTIC ECONOMY REMAINS STEADY AMIDST GLOBAL UNCERTAINTIES

1.22 As per the first advance estimates released by the National Statistical Office, Ministry  of  Statistics  &amp;  Programme  Implementation  (MoSPI),  the  real  gross domestic product (GDP) growth for FY25 is estimated to be 6.4 per cent. From the angle of aggregate demand in the economy, private final consumption expenditure at constant prices is estimated to grow by 7.3 per cent, driven by a rebound in rural demand. PFCE as a share of GDP (at current prices) is estimated to increase from 60.3 per cent in FY24 to 61.8 per cent in FY25. This share is the highest since FY03. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) (at constant prices) is estimated to grow by 6.4 per cent.

1.23 On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) is also estimated to grow by 6.4 per cent. The agriculture sector is expected to rebound to a growth of 3.8 per cent in  FY25. The industrial sector is estimated to grow by 6.2 per cent in FY25. Strong growth rates in construction activities and electricity, gas, water supply and other utility

services are expected to support industrial expansion. Growth in the services sector is expected to remain robust at 7.2 per cent, driven by healthy activity in financial, real estate, professional services, public administration, defence, and other services. The analysis of growth trends in this chapter, hereinafter, is mostly based on the trends in the first half (H1) of FY25, on which the information base is more comprehensive.

## Resilient recovery

1.24 The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions to economies worldwide. Economic Survey 2023-24 14  compared the post-pandemic trends until Q4 FY24 with the  pre-pandemic  trajectory  and  concluded  that  the  economy  grew  briskly  enough to avert any permanent loss of output. This section extends the analysis to Q2 FY25 (ending September 2024) with a sectoral view of the economy.

1.25  The  overall  picture  is  encouraging.  Aggregate  GVA  surpassed  its  pre-pandemic trend in Q1 FY25, and it now hovers above the trend in the H1 FY25  15 . The agriculture sector remains strong, consistently operating well above trend levels. The industrial sector has also found its footing above the pre-pandemic trajectory. The robust rate of  growth  in  the  recent  years  has  taken  the  services  sector  close  to  its  trend  levels (Chart I.21 to Chart I.24).

1.26 A closer look at industrial sub-sectors reveals a spectrum of performances (Chart I.25). Construction has been a standout, gaining momentum since mid-FY21 and soaring approximately 15 per cent above its pre-pandemic trend-an impressive feat driven by robust infrastructure development and housing demand. The utilities sector, including electricity,  gas,  water  supply, and other services, reached its pre-pandemic trend by the end of FY23 and has consistently stayed above these levels. Manufacturing, while steadily  recovering,  remains  slightly  below  its  pre-pandemic  trajectory.  Meanwhile, mining continues to operate below its pre-pandemic trend.

1.27  The recovery within the services sector has been uneven (Chart I.26). Financial, real  estate  and  professional  services  have  taken  the  lead,  surpassing  pre-pandemic trend  levels  by  the  end  of  FY23.  Public  administration,  defence,  and  other  services followed suit, exceeding the trend for the first time in Q1 of FY25 since the onset of the  pandemic.  However,  trade,  hotels,  transport,  and  communication  services  are gradually catching up with the pre-pandemic trend. These contact-intensive sectors faced challenges due to lockdown, restricted demand for travel, and reduced demand for hospitality, entertainment, and personal services.

## Growth in H1 FY25 driven by agriculture and services sector

1.28 The real GVA grew by 6.2 per cent in H1 FY25. A strong growth momentum in Q1 FY25 was followed by a subdued performance in Q2 FY25. The agriculture and services sectors emerged as key growth drivers during this period. However, the overall growth was tempered by moderation in industrial growth, particularly in manufacturing, which faced challenges from slowing global demand and supply chain disruptions.

## Improved agricultural prospects in FY25

1.29 Agriculture growth remained steady in H1 FY25, with Q2 recording a growth rate of  3.5  per  cent,  marking  an  improvement  over  the  previous  four  quarters.  Healthy Kharif production, above-normal monsoons, and an adequate reservoir level supported agricultural growth. As per the first advanced estimates of agricultural production for 2024-25, total Kharif food grain production is estimated at a record 1647.05 lakh metric tonnes (LMT), higher by 5.7 per cent compared to 2023-24 and 8.2 per cent higher than the average food grain production in the past five years. The estimated increase is mainly on account of the rise in rice, maize, coarse grains and oilseeds output. A normal southwest  monsoon  in  2024  has  improved  the  water  levels  in  reservoirs,  ensuring sufficient water for irrigation during the rabi crop production. As of 10 January 2025,

rabi sowing of wheat and gram was 1.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent higher, respectively, compared  to  the  previous  year.  Improved  agricultural  prospects  also  bode  well  for softening of food inflation pressures over the course of the year.

## Manufacturing sector growth moderates but shows positive expectations

1.30 The industrial sector grew by 6 per cent in H1 FY25. Q1 saw a strong growth of 8.3 per cent, but growth moderated in Q2 due to three key factors. First, manufacturing exports slowed significantly due to weak demand from destination countries, and aggressive trade and industrial policies in major trading nations. Second, the aboveaverage monsoon had mixed effects - while it replenished reservoirs and supported agriculture, it also disrupted sectors like mining, construction, and, to some extent, manufacturing. Third, the variation in the timing of festivities between September and October in the previous and current years led to a modest growth slowdown in Q2 FY25.

1.31  Disaggregated data reveals that while many manufacturing sub-sectors experienced growth, others faced challenges, likely due to global and seasonal factors. Oil companies suffered due to inventory losses and lower refining margins, while steel companies faced price pressures and lower global prices. The cement sector faced weak demand in Q2 due to heavy rains and lower selling prices. However, with the conclusion of the monsoon season and the expected pick-up in government capital expenditure, sectors such as cement, iron, and steel are expected to see a recovery. Further, mining and electricity are expected to normalise after the monsoon-related disruptions. 16

1.32 Despite  various  challenges,  India  continues  to  register  the  fastest  growth  in manufacturing PMI, which is also reflected in Chart I.7 of the previous section. The latest Manufacturing PMI for December 2024 remained well within the expansionary zone. The expansion rate for December 2024 exceeded its long-term average, driven by new business gains, robust demand, and advertising efforts. Meanwhile, international orders grew to a four-month high midway through the third fiscal quarter, signalling recovering external demand, as reported by companies.

1.33 According to the RBI's Industrial Outlook Survey, manufacturing firms reported improved demand conditions in Q3 FY25 and expect further improvements in Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26. The survey also reflected better expectations for production, order books, employment,  capacity  utilisation,  and  the  overall  business  environment  during  Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26.

## Robust growth in the services sector

1.34 The services sector continues to perform well in FY25. A notable growth in Q1 and Q2 resulted in 7.1 per cent growth in H1 FY25. Across sub-categories, all the sub-sectors have performed well. The robust performance of the services sector is also reflected

in high-frequency indicators (HFIs). PMI services have been in an expansionary zone during H1 FY25, supported by growth in new orders, rise in output, improvement in sales and enhanced employment generation. The hospitality sector performed well, with hotel occupancy rates in H1 FY25 similar to the previous year. Average daily rates and revenue per room increased due to higher corporate and leisure travel. Air cargo activity grew in double digits, while port traffic remained stable. Information Technology (IT) companies also performed better than the previous quarter. 17

## Analysis of GDP by expenditure categories

1.35  India's GDP at constant (2011-12) prices grew by 6.7 per cent and 5.4 per cent in Q1 and Q2 FY25, respectively. This implied a real GDP growth of 6.0 per cent in the first half of the current fiscal.

1.36 From  a  demand  perspective,  Private  Final  Consumption  Expenditure  (PFCE) firmed up in H1 FY25, growing by 6.7 per cent YoY. While National Accounts data is not disaggregated by geography, indicators such as 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler sales and tractor sales signal that rural demand contributed to private consumption growth. This is also reflected in the January 2025 round of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD's) Rural Economic Conditions and Sentiments Survey, where 78.5 per cent of rural households reported an increase in their consumption expenditure during the last year. 18  The impulse from rural demand is expected to continue in the second half of the fiscal year with the returns from a bumper Kharif crop and higher MSPs for a prospectively good Rabi crop.

1.37 On  the  other  hand,  indicators  of  urban  demand  presented  mixed  trends. According  to  data  from  the  Federation  of  Automobile  Dealers  Associations (FADA) 19 , the growth of passenger vehicle sales has slowed to 4.2 per YoY cent in April - November 2024 compared to 9.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sales in urban areas, as per  Nielsen  IQ,  have  recorded  a  moderate  growth  in  H1FY25.  However,  there  is steady growth of 7.7 per cent YoY in air passenger traffic in April - November 2024. The 7.3 per cent YoY growth indicated by the First Advance Estimates for PFCE at constant prices for FY25 indicates a pick-up in the most recent months.

1.38 The  moderation in  real  GDP  growth  can  be  traced  to  a  softening  of  growth  in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) from 10.1 per cent in H1 FY24 to 6.4 per cent in  H1  FY25.  Q1  FY25  witnessed  a  slowdown  in  capital  expenditure  across  different levels of government on account of the conduct of the general elections. Private sector investment growth may have remained subdued thus far in FY25 on account of the domestic political timetable, global uncertainties and overcapacities.

1.39 An additional reason for the slowdown in capital formation growth in Q2 FY25 may have emanated from the moderation in residential investment by households in this quarter, which is on the back of a sharp uptick over the last few quarters. Industry reports, however, point out that the correction in demand-supply metrics in this sector is indicative of market normalisation after a period of robust performance. An inventory overhang of 23 months signals healthy demand momentum in the segment.

1.40 The  slowdown  in  investment  activity  is  likely  temporary.  Green  shoots  in  capital formation are visible. Union government capex is up 8.2 per cent in July - November 2024 and is expected to pick up further pace. Early results of the RBI's Order Books, Inventory, and  Capacity  Utilisation  Survey  (OBICUS)  show  that  the  seasonally  adjusted  capacity utilisation (CU) in manufacturing firms was 74.7 per cent in Q2 FY25, above the longterm average of 73.8 per cent. 21 A private sector report's 22 analysis of a sample of capital goods companies indicates that the order books of these companies have registered a sharp increase of 23.6 per cent in FY24 as against a compund anual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5 per cent in the preceding four years. Moreover, in H1 FY25, there has been a growth of 10.3 per cent compared to the end of FY24. The RBI's report on private investments showed that investment intentions increased to ₹2.45 lakh crore for FY25 as compared to ₹1.6 lakh crore for FY24. Along with fresh investment, some of the existing intentions would spill over and be implemented in FY26.

1.41  On the external front, exports of goods and non-factor services at constant prices increased by 5.6 per cent in H1 FY25, while imports increased by 0.7 per cent. In Q2 FY25,  imports  of  goods  and  services  at  constant  prices  contracted  by  2.9  per  cent, primarily driven by a decline in commodity prices. As a result, net exports contributed positively to real GDP growth in this period.

1.42 As  India's  economy  continues  to  expand,  the  growth  process  has  been  ably supported by stability on fronts such as inflation, fiscal health, and balance of payments.
