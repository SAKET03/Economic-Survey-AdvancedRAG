6.6 As  the  electoral  process  settled,  capital  expenditure  saw  an  uptick  in  JulyNovember 2024 (Chart VI.2). Capex in infrastructure sectors is expected to gain further momentum in the remaining months of the current fiscal. On an average, ministries related to infrastructure sectors utilised 60 per cent of the budgeted capex during April to November 2024. This compares favourably with the progress achieved in the same period in FY20 when the 17th Lok Sabha elections were held.
