## Box VI.10:  Capacity advancement in data centre

India's  data  centre  market  is  witnessing  significant  growth,  fuelled  by  the  expansion  of infrastructure and a rising demand for digital services. The following literature provides evidence to support this trend:

- India's colocation data centre capacity reached 977 MW 11 in 2023. Capacity of 258 MW

11 Cushman &amp; Wakefield (2024, July). Potential for 5x capacity expansion to fuel digital transformation. https:// tinyurl.com/4w4x34a4.

was added in the year, reflecting a 105 per cent year-on-year growth. The total capacity under construction for 2024-2028 is 1.03 GW, with an additional 1.29 GW planned.

- The  data  centre  market  in  India  is  expected  to  grow  from  US$4.5  billion  in  2023  to US$11.6 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 10.98 per cent 12 .
- India benefits from lower construction costs, owing to its well-established IT and digitally enabled services ecosystem, as well as relatively affordable real estate with a median of US$6.8 million per MW in 2023, compared to US$9.17 million in Australia, US$12.73 million in Japan, and US$11.23 million in Singapore 13 .
