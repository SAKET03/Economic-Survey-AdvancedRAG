## INVESTMENT AND INFRASTRUCTURE: KEEPING IT GOING

06

<!-- image -->

Building infrastructure - physical, digital and social - has been a central focus area for the Government in the last five years. This has had various dimensions -  increase  in  public  spending  on  infrastructure,  creation  of  institutions  to de-bottleneck  approvals  and  execution  and  innovative  modes  of  resource mobilisation.  In  FY25,  capital  expenditure  has  gathered  momentum  postelections.

The  government  has  recognised  the  importance  of  continuing  the  pace  of infrastructure building and  the  increasing  need  to  promote  sustainable construction practices. It is also clear that public capital alone cannot meet the demands  of  upgrading  the  country's  infrastructure  commensurate  with  the requirements  of  Viksit  Bharat@2047.  We  need  to  ensure  increasing  private participation  in  infrastructure  by  improving  their  capacity  to  conceptualise projects and their confidence in risk and revenue-sharing mechanisms, contract management, conflict resolution and project closure. The efforts of the Union Government would need to be supplemented with wholehearted acceptance of the need for public-private partnerships in infrastructure across the country. Equally important, the private sector must reciprocate, too.

## INTRODUCTION

6.1 India's development aspirations require a substantial investment in infrastructure over the next decade. While estimates of the required spending differ in scale 1,2,3, there is  general  agreement  that  current  infrastructure  spending  needs  to  be  increased  to achieve these objectives. Keeping this in view, the government has laid a special focus on infrastructure in the last five years. Reflecting this intent, the capital expenditure by the union government on major infrastructure sectors 4   has been increased at a trend rate of 38.8 per cent from FY20 to FY24.

4  Infrastructure sectors include atomic energy, civil aviation, telecommunications, renewable energy, power, road, rural development, ports, housing &amp; urban affairs and railways.

6.2 The  government  has  also  instituted  many  complementary  mechanisms  to expedite planning, clearances and execution of projects.  The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) was launched with a forward-looking approach, targeting a projected infrastructure investment of around ₹111 lakh crore from FY20 to FY25. The NIP serves as a centralised platform for hosting projects of states, union territories and central ministries to facilitate their monitoring and review. Currently, it encompasses over 9,766 projects and schemes across 37 sub-sectors. These projects are tracked and reviewed through the integrated India Investment Grid (NIP-Project Monitoring Group) portal.

6.3 The government is bringing in innovative frameworks for attracting investment in infrastructure projects. To boost private investment in brownfield assets, the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) was launched in August 2021. This initiative laid down the  framework  for  monetisation  policy  and  identified  a  pipeline  of  potential  core assets with an indicative value of ₹6.0 lakh crore for the period FY22 to FY25 5 .  For the period FY22 to FY24, against the target of ₹4.30 lakh crore, transactions of ₹3.86 lakh crore in terms of accruals or private investments were completed under the core asset monetisation. Sector-wise, roads, power, coal, and mines led the performance, supported by market-tested models and reforms. For FY25, the aggregate monetisation target is set at ₹1.91 lakh crore.

6.4 Despite  such  earnest  efforts  by  the  union  government  and  quite  a  few  state governments and public sector undertakings supplementing these efforts with increased capex,  there  is  still  a  significant  unmet  demand  for  infrastructure  development. While this is typical of a dynamic, developing economy, India's goal of Viksit Bharat necessitates the progressive filling of this gap with innovative modes of financing and greater private participation. This sets the context for the discussion in this chapter.

## INFRASTRUCTURE CAPEX IMPROVES POST-ELECTION

6.5 The pace of the Union Government's capital expenditure in major infrastructure sectors 6 was affected during Q1FY25, largely due to the model code of conduct during the general elections. The unusual patterns of the last monsoon season also slowed down the progress of work. Hence, a year-over-year comparison may not be appropriate for Q1FY25.

6.6 As  the  electoral  process  settled,  capital  expenditure  saw  an  uptick  in  JulyNovember 2024 (Chart VI.2). Capex in infrastructure sectors is expected to gain further momentum in the remaining months of the current fiscal. On an average, ministries related to infrastructure sectors utilised 60 per cent of the budgeted capex during April to November 2024. This compares favourably with the progress achieved in the same period in FY20 when the 17th Lok Sabha elections were held.

## PHYSICAL CONNECTIVITY

6.7 Notwithstanding  the  electoral timetable, the capacity addition in physical connectivity sectors stayed on course during FY25. This section examines developments in major components of physical connectivity.

## Railways

6.8 During FY25 so far, the progress in the expansion of the railway network stayed at levels comparable to the previous year, while the addition of rolling stock increased considerably. Between April and October 2024, 17 new pairs of Vande Bharat trains were introduced to the network, and 228 coaches were produced.  The details of progress in major railway projects are given in Box VI.1.

## POWER SECTOR

6.18 The power sector network continues to expand, with installed capacity rising by  7.2  per  cent  year-on-year  to  456.7  GW  as  of  November  2024.  The  addition  of transformation  capacity  also  gained  momentum  this  year  (Chart  VI.13).  However, the addition of transmission lines was affected by the heavy monsoon conditions that hampered work.

<!-- image -->

6.19 In  the  shift  towards  renewable  energy,  the  power  sector  has  been  bolstered primarily by large-scale solar and wind initiatives. By the end of December 2024, the country's total renewable energy installed capacity increased by 15.8 per cent year-onyear, reaching 209.4 GW, up from 180.8 GW in December 2023. Renewable energy now constitutes about 47 per cent of India's total installed capacity (left panel of chart VI.14) , highlighting a growing dependence on cleaner, non-fossil fuel-based energy sources.

<!-- image -->

6.20 The  Government  of  India  implemented  multiple  initiatives  aimed  at  ensuring uninterrupted power supply to every household. Under the Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY), Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS) introduced in

2014, and the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana (SAUBHAGYA), introduced in 2017, about ₹1.85 lakh crore has been invested to boost distribution infrastructure across various states.  Consequently, 18,374 villages  have  been  electrified  under  DDUGJY, and 2.9 crore households have gained access to electricity through SAUBHAGYA 7 .

6.21 The government has also been implementing the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme  since  July  2021  to  enhance  the  quality  and  reliability  of  power  supply  for consumers. This initiative aims to create a financially sustainable and operationally efficient distribution sector. With a total outlay of ₹3.0 lakh crore and gross budgetary support of ₹97,631 crore allocated for the period from FY22 to FY26, projects worth ₹2.8 lakh crore have been approved to develop distribution infrastructure and implement smart metering solutions 8 .

6.22 Aided by these measures, the daily average power supply has improved from 22.1 hours in FY14 to 23.4 hours in FY24 in the urban areas and from 12.5 hours in FY14 to 21.9 hours in the rural areas. The gap between energy demand and supply has also declined from 4.2 per cent in FY14 to a mere 0.1 per cent by December 2024 9 .

## Box VI.8: Measures initiated in February 2024 to facilitate consumers

To enhance the energy infrastructure following additional measures have been undertaken to  simplify  rooftop  solar  installations,  support  EV  charging,  expedite  new  electricity connections and  facilitate better consumer experience.

- Rooftop solar PV simplification: Rules were amended in February 2024 to ease and accelerate the installation of rooftop solar systems. Approvals for systems up to 10 kW no longer require feasibility studies, and timelines for larger systems and commissioning were significantly reduced.
- EV charging connections: Consumers can now obtain separate electricity connections for charging electric vehicles, supporting India's Net Zero goal by 2070.
- Faster new connections: Timelines for  obtaining  new  electricity  connections  were reduced to three days in metropolitan areas, seven days in municipal areas, and fifteen days in rural areas.
- Consumer choice in metering: Residents of group housing societies and residential colonies  can  choose  either  individual  or  single-point  electricity  connections.  This  has promoted transparency and flexibility.
- Meter reading accuracy: If a consumer disputes their meter reading, the licensee must install  an  additional  meter  within  five  days  to  verify  consumption  over  three  months, ensuring billing accuracy.

- India's colocation data centre capacity reached 977 MW 11 in 2023. Capacity of 258 MW

11 Cushman &amp; Wakefield (2024, July). Potential for 5x capacity expansion to fuel digital transformation. https:// tinyurl.com/4w4x34a4.

was added in the year, reflecting a 105 per cent year-on-year growth. The total capacity under construction for 2024-2028 is 1.03 GW, with an additional 1.29 GW planned.

- The  data  centre  market  in  India  is  expected  to  grow  from  US$4.5  billion  in  2023  to US$11.6 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 10.98 per cent 12 .
- India benefits from lower construction costs, owing to its well-established IT and digitally enabled services ecosystem, as well as relatively affordable real estate with a median of US$6.8 million per MW in 2023, compared to US$9.17 million in Australia, US$12.73 million in Japan, and US$11.23 million in Singapore 13 .

## RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE

## Rural Drinking Water and Sanitation

6.28 The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) aims to ensure long-term water security for rural households  by  providing  reliable  access  to  safe  piped  drinking  water.  When  it  was launched in August 2019, only 3.23 crore (17 per cent) of rural households had tap water connections. Since then, over 12.06 crore families have been added, increasing the total to more than 15.30 crore (79.1 per cent) out of approximately 19.34 crore rural households as of November 26, 2024. Eight states, namely, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Haryana,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Punjab,  Telangana  and  Mizoram,  and  three union territories, namely, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, Dadra Nagar Haveli &amp; Daman Diu and Puducherry have achieved 100 per cent coverage. There are 2,160 water quality laboratories, 1,570 of which are accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories, ensuring the safety of drinking water.

## Box VI.11: Impact of Jal Jeevan Mission

The mission improved access to safe drinking water in rural areas, particularly in regions affected by water quality issues like arsenic and fluoride. Its impact includes better health outcomes and enhanced water security for vulnerable populations.

- Coverage of quality-affected Areas: At the time of the launch of JJM, out of 19.4 crore  rural  households,  over  75.2  lakh  households  lived  in  quality-affected  areas  that lacked  safe  drinking  water.  Since  its  implementation,  69.23  lakh  rural  households  in quality-affected areas are getting safe piped water supply.
- Arsenic-affected and fluoride-affected habitants: Arsenic-Affected and FluorideAffected  Habitants:  Safe  drinking  water  has  been  provided  to  more  than  23  lakh households in arsenic-affected habitations and 11.43 lakh households in fluoride-affected habitations.

6.29 Swachh  Bharat  Mission-  Grameen  (SBM-G)  achieved  open  defecation-free (ODF) status in the first phase. Phase II of SBM-G is implemented from 2020-21 to 2024-25, with a focus on converting the villages from ODF to ODF Plus.  An ODF plus progress is captured in three categories 14  namely aspiring, rising and model. The goal of SBM-G Phase-II is to make all the villages ODF Plus, i.e. 'Model Category'. An ODF Plus village in the model category is one that is sustaining its ODF status, plus having arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, observing visual cleanliness (minimal  litter,  minimal  stagnant  wastewater  and  no  plastic  waste  dump  in  public places) and displaying ODF plus information, education and communication messages. During April to November 2024, 1.92 lakh villages were incrementally declared ODF Plus under the model category, taking the total number of ODF Plus villages to 3.64 lakh.

## Box VI.12:  Success stories of waste management initiatives

Model of sustainable development and community empowerment in Erattayar Gram Panchayat, Idukki, Kerala :

<!-- image -->

By focusing on waste management, the Panchayat preserves the environment and creates jobs,  particularly  for  women.  The  strategy  involves  door-to-door  collection,  resource recovery, and recycling, reaching over 4,600 households and 500 institutions. Around 30 women are employed, earning an average of ₹10,000 monthly.

Despite  initial  challenges  like  fee  collection  and  infrastructure  issues,  the  Panchayat's resilience has driven progress. With enhanced training and partnerships, waste management practices have improved. The Haritha Karma Sena, with 28 dedicated members, plays a crucial  role  in  this  effort,  collecting  user  fees  from  about  85  per  cent  of  households  and 90 per cent of institutions, generating approximately ₹2.5 lakh per month. Materials are meticulously segregated and sent to private agencies for further processing.

The Panchayat collects four tonnes of plastic and other non-biodegradable items monthly, adhering to a set schedule. This initiative not only fosters cleanliness but also empowers women, promoting inclusivity and gender equality. Erattayar Gram Panchayat's approach, emphasising  collaboration,  innovation,  and  empowerment,  sets  an  example  for  other communities striving for a greener, more equitable future.

## Transforming Waste into Wealth: NADEP Composting, Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh

The Chhindwara district of Madhya  Pradesh has prioritised biodegradable waste management as part of SBM-G Phase 2, establishing waste management infrastructure in 784 Gram Panchayats and 1,898 villages, including 8,507 NADEP (a method of organic composting that produces fertiliser from organic materials) compost pits. However, due to improper usage of these pits as community dustbins, the district initiated a comprehensive Swachhata Drive from May 1 to June 30. This initiative focused on enhancing awareness and promoting sustainable practices among rural communities.

Community  engagement  and  capacity-building  programmes  were  instrumental  in  the initiative's  success.  Extensive  outreach  efforts  educated  community  members  about  the benefits  of  composting,  while  targeted  training  programmmes  equipped  farmers  and stakeholders with the knowledge to manage organic waste effectively. These efforts ensured the appropriate utilisation of cow dung and organic waste in NADEP pits, facilitating the production of high-quality compost.

The  initiative witnessed  active participation  of  approximately  68,050  stakeholders, including  farmers,  PRI  members,  Swachhagrahis,  SHGs,  and  community  members, fostering significant improvements in waste segregation and management across villages. Each NADEP pit is projected to yield 500 kg of compost per cycle, generating an estimated income  of  ₹30,000  annually  for  farmers  through  three  composting  cycles.  This  shift  is expected  to  reduce  dependency  on  chemical  fertilisers,  decrease  costs,  and  enhance  soil health, supporting sustainable agricultural practices. Future plans include expanding the deployment of NADEP pits, ensuring their optimal use, and establishing market linkages for compost.

## URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE

## Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban

6.31 Building on the success of the Open Defecation Free (ODF) nation through the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM-U), SBM-Urban 2.0 was launched in 2021. It envisions

creating 'garbage-free cities', integrating waste management and sanitation practices aligned with sustainability and circular economy principles. Progress and cumulative achievements under the SBM-U are given below:

6.33   Besides,  leveraging  ICT-enabled  tools  strengthened  the  mission  governance. The Swachhata App effectively allows citizens to report grievances, directing them to the relevant municipal corporation for resolution. With 2.08 crore users, the app has handled 2.55 crore complaints, resolving 2.39 crore. The Google toilet locator allows users to upload information about community and public toilets in their cities as 'SBM Toilet' on Google Maps and provide feedback. To date, 67,407 toilets across 3,326 cities are mapped on Google Maps, including those in hospitals, malls, bus stands, railway stations, metro stations, markets, and more.

6.34 Urban  housing: The  Pradhan  Mantri  Awas  Yojana  -  Urban  (PMAY-U), launched in 2015, aims to provide permanent housing in urban areas. As of November 25, 2024, a total of 1.18 crore houses have been sanctioned, with 1.14 crore grounded and over 89 lakh completed. PMAY-U 2.0 was launched in September 2024 to assist an additional one crore households. Currently, 29 states and union territories have signed agreements to implement PMAY-U 2.0, with approval having been granted for 6 lakh houses in FY25.

6.35 Urban transport: Metro rail and rapid rail transit systems are operational or under construction in 29 cities across India, with 1010 kilometres currently operational in 23 cities and an additional 980 kilometres underway. As of January 5, 2025, 62.7 kms were operationalised in FY25, and the daily ridership reached 10.2 million. These systems have led to considerable savings in emissions, time, vehicle operating costs, accidents and infrastructure maintenance.

## 6.36 Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT):

AMRUT scheme was launched in 2015 to focus on improving urban water management in 500 cities. As a result, tap water coverage has increased to 70 per cent, and sewerage coverage has risen to 62 per cent. The mission has created or augmented water treatment capacity of 4,649 million litres per day and developed 2,439 parks, adding 5,070 acres of green space. In 2021, AMRUT 2.0 was introduced to expand coverage to all statutory towns and cities, with an allocation of ₹2.77 lakh crore during FY22 to FY26. This phase so far has initiated 8,923 projects worth ₹1.89 lakh crore. AMRUT 2.0 actively involves self-help groups and promotes innovative technologies.

6.37 Smart Cities Mission: Launched in 2015, the mission aims to develop smart cities with essential infrastructure, good quality of life and a sustainable environment. As of 13 January 2025, 8,058 projects worth 1.64 lakh crore have been proposed, with 7,479 projects worth 1.50 lakh crore completed (Chart VI.20). Achievements under the mission are provided in Chart V1.21.

6.38 Central to urban transformation is leveraging technology and data to improve the efficiency and quality of urban services, including transportation, energy, healthcare, and education. Along these lines, the government has taken various initiatives, which are detailed in Box VI.13.

## Box VI.13: Initiatives driving urban transformation

Several  initiatives  are  being  implemented  to  foster  sustainable  urban  development  and governance.  These  efforts  focus  on  enhancing  climate  resilience,  promoting  data-driven decision-making,  and  improving  infrastructure  and  citizen  services  across  cities.  These initiatives include:

- Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework (CSCAF): Launched in 2019, this public assessment framework aims to enhance climate-sensitive development in cities. CSCAF 2.0 was introduced in 2020, evaluating 126 cities via 28 indicators across five thematic areas. The upcoming CSCAF 3.0 is currently being developed.
- DataSmart cities strategy: promotes data-driven governance with the data maturity assessment framework to assess cities'  readiness  to  adopt  data  solutions,  focusing  on systemic and sectoral pillars.
- National urban innovation stack: facilitates collaboration within urban ecosystems by leveraging urban data, supporting data-driven governance.
- National  urban  learning  platform: A  scalable  platform  designed  for  capacity building among urban local bodies, offering a comprehensive approach to improve urban management capabilities.
- City  investments  to  innovate,  integrate  and  sustain  challenge: supports innovative urban projects with significant funding, promoting circular economy practices. The  second  phase  was  approved  in  2023  to  fund  climate-resilient  infrastructure  in  a maximum of 18 cities.
- Urban learning internship programme: Launched in 2020, TULIP connects urban local bodies with youth, offering internship opportunities to enhance skills and experience in  urban  transformation. As of now, more than 49,000 internship opportunities have been posted across the nation, out of which over 14,500 internships are ongoing and completed.
- National  Urban  Digital  Mission: seeks  to  establish  shared  digital  infrastructure across cities, enhancing citizen-centric governance and service delivery by 2024.

6.39 Real  Estate  Development: Rules  under  the  Real  Estate  (Regulation  &amp; Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) have been notified in all States and Union Territories except Nagaland, with various regulatory authorities established. About 1.38 lakh real estate projects and 95,987 real estate agents have been registered under the Real Estate Regulatory Authority as of January 6, 2025. 1.38 lakh complaints have been disposed of by the RERA across the country.

## TOURISM INFRASTRUCTURE

6.40 The government has introduced several initiatives to promote domestic tourism. Pilgrimage  Rejuvenation  and  Spiritual  Augmentation  Drive  (PRASHAD)  aims  to develop tourism infrastructure at identified pilgrimage destinations and heritage cities (Chart VI.22).

<!-- image -->

6.41 Another  major  initiative  of  the  Government  to  promote  domestic  tourism is  Swadesh  Darshan,  which  is  aimed  at  the  integrated  development  of  tourism destinations, including theme-based tourist circuits. This programme was rechristened as  the  Swadesh  Darshan  Scheme  2.0  (SD  2.0)  in  2022,  with  the  vision  to  develop sustainable and responsible tourism destinations. Under this scheme, 34 projects have been approved, with a total funding of ₹793.2 crore.

6.42 Moreover,  in  line  with  the  FY25  budget  announcement,  40  projects  across  23 states have been approved for interest-free loans for 50 years for an amount of ₹3,295.8 crore under the special assistance to states for capital investment. This initiative aims to create iconic tourist centres of global standards by supporting their development and marketing  17 .

## SPACE INFRASTRUCTURE

6.43 India  currently  operates  56  active  space  assets,  including  19  communication satellites, nine navigation satellites, four scientific satellites, and 24 earth observation satellites. ISRO has enhanced its capabilities by adding a small satellite launch vehicle to its fleet. New Space India Limited (NSIL) successfully fulfilled its contract to launch 72 OneWeb satellites into low earth orbit.  Recently it also launched the GSAT-20 satellite in collaboration with SpaceX. Various initiatives by the government in the domain of space-based infrastructure are given in Box VI.14.

## Box VI.14: Space-based infrastructure monitoring platforms

ISRO's advanced geospatial platforms are playing a pivotal role in infrastructure monitoring and management. These initiatives support a range of projects, from rural development and electrical infrastructure to judicial and urban planning, enhancing efficiency and tracking progress.

- ISRO's  Bhuvan  Platform: supports  infrastructure  monitoring  under  schemes  like MGNREGA and the watershed component of PMKSY at different stages of implementation.
- Electrical  infrastructure  management: Bhuvan  facilitates  the  management  of electrical infrastructure in Maharashtra and Telangana through Web-GIS portals.
- NyayaVikas Portal for judicial infrastructure: Developed in collaboration with the Department of Justice, this portal monitors 2,840 judicial projects using Web GIS and mobile geotagging, with over 7,900 geotags created to track progress.
- Urban geospatial databases for AMRUT Cities: ISRO has created large-scale 2D urban  geospatial  databases  for  238  AMRUT  cities,  assisting  in  developing  GIS-based master plans for urban planning.

6.44 As  part  of  India's  Space  Vision  2047,  the  Union  Cabinet  has  approved  four key  projects:  the  Gaganyaan  follow-on  mission,  which  will  pave  the  way  for  the establishment of the first module of the Bhartiya Antariksh Station; the Chandrayaan-4 Lunar Sample Return Mission; the Venus Orbiter Mission; and the development of the Next Generation Launch Vehicle. These initiatives aim to enhance India's technological capabilities,  foster  industry  collaboration,  and  strengthen  the  country's  position  in global space exploration.

## CONCLUSIONS AND WAY FORWARD

6.45 The government has placed infrastructure development at the centre stage of its fiscal and public policy agenda. The capital expenditure of the union government for  FY25 has been budgeted at about 3.3 times the capex for FY20. In Q1FY25, the constraints on new approvals and spending during the general elections, coupled with heavy monsoon in many regions, affected the progress of the infrastructure spending. Between July and November 2024, the pace of capex has picked up.

6.46 The review in the chapter shows that the progress of physical indicators in the current year mirrors the financial progress. The addition to the rolling stock of railways, port handling capacity and power and transformation capacity improved during FY25 so far on a Y-o-Y basis. The addition to the length of highways, roads and railway lines has been modestly lower. On the whole, seen against the background of the constraints that  prevailed  in  Q1FY25,  infrastructure  build-up  in  the  current  year  has  stayed  on course.

6.47 Apart from asset creation, our infrastructure programme also emphasises the use of sustainable materials and processes. These considerations are receiving particular attention in areas such as highway development, waterway projects, power capacity addition and waste management. Given the global imperative of promoting sustainable practices, model practices in this direction need to be replicated widely.

6.48 India needs a continued step-up of infrastructure investment over the next two decades to sustain a high rate of growth. Requirements are aplenty. Accelerating our efforts to build integrated multi-modal transport, coupled with the modernisation of existing physical assets, will improve efficiency and last-mile connectivity. Disasterresilient  urbanisation,  public  transport,  preservation  and  upkeep  of  heritage  sites, monuments and tourist destinations, as well as rural public infrastructure, including connectivity, call for greater attention. Our Net Zero commitments entail added stress on creating renewable energy capacities.

6.49 Quite clearly, public sector efforts cannot fully meet these requirements. There are binding budget constraints to the different tiers of government. Private participation should accelerate in many critical infrastructure sectors in many ways-programme and project planning, financing, construction, maintenance, monetisation and impact assessment.

6.50 Our  infrastructure  programme  supports  a  variety  of  PPP  models  like  buildoperate-transfer  (toll  and  annuity),  design-build-finance-operate-transfer,  hybrid annuity  model  and  toll-operate-transfer.  The  government  has  instituted  many  debottlenecking and facilitatory mechanisms like the National Infrastructure Pipeline, National Monetisation Pipeline and PM-Gati Sakti that have made progress. Financial market regulators have introduced reforms to encourage private participation. Yet, the uptake of private enterprise is limited in many core sectors.

6.51 The  strategy  to  step  up  private  participation  needs  coordinated  action  of  all stakeholders involved - governments at different tiers, financial market players, project management experts and planners, and the private sector. Capacities to conceptualise projects,  develop  sector-specific  innovative  strategies  for  execution,  and,  develop high-expertise areas such as risk and revenue sharing, contract management, conflict resolution and project closure need to improve substantially. The efforts of the Union Government would need to be supplemented with wholehearted acceptance of the need for public-private partnerships in infrastructure across the country.
