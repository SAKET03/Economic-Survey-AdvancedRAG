# India's Medium-term Outlook

## INDIA'S MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK

- 5.1 To realise its economic aspirations of becoming Viksit Bharat by the time of the centenary of independence, India needs to achieve a growth rate of around 8 per cent at constant prices, on average, for about a decade or two. While the desirability of this growth rate is unquestionable, it's important to recognise that the global environment - political and economic - will influence India's growth outcomes.

5.2 The projections for India from the lens of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) of the International Monetary Fund (referred to as IMF or the Fund interchangeably in the rest of this chapter) as recently as October of FY25 are sanguine. The IMF WEO projects India to become a USD 5 trillion economy by FY28 and reach a size of USD 6.307 trillion by FY30 [Chart V.1]. This translates into an annual nominal growth rate

of nearly 10.2 per cent in USD terms for FY25 to FY30. 2  To put this in context, in the thirty years between FY94 and FY24, India's dollar gross domestic product (GDP) grew at a compounded annual rate of 8.9 per cent. So, the IMF expects India to grow at a significantly higher rate of 10.2 per cent in dollar terms in the next five years.

5.3 In rupee terms, India's nominal GDP grew at a compounded annual rate of 12.4 per cent in the three decades ending FY24. In the next five years, the IMF projects that India's nominal GDP will grow at around 10.7 per cent annually. So, in effect, given the projected growth rate of only 10.2 per cent in dollar terms, the Fund expects the rupee to weaken, on average, only by 0.5 per cent per annum in the next five years, compared to the 3.3 per cent annual depreciation experienced in the three decades up to FY24. The  projected  mild  rupee  depreciation  is  a  recognition  of  India's  growth  potential, its attractiveness as an investment destination and the expectation of convergence of India's inflation rate with that of the United States. The Fund also projects that India's current account deficit will rise gently and gradually to 2.2 per cent of GDP by FY30. To reiterate, given the current state of the world and its likely evolution, the realisation of these projections will be a very good thing for India.

5.4 The Ministry of Statistics  and  Programme Implementation reckons in the first advance estimate the economy will grow at 6.4 per cent in constant prices. For FY26, we project a growth rate of between 6.3 per cent and 6.8 per cent in the first chapter of this Survey. This is in line with the Fund's projection of the growth rate of India's

2  India's GDP growth at constant prices adjusted for the inflation differential between India and the USA gives us the estimate of GDP in USD terms. Thus, GDP expressed in a numeraire currency like the USD accounts for prices. That is why it is also a measure of 'real' GDP.

GDP at constant prices at around 6.5 per cent between FY26 and FY30. This chapter explores the policy action agenda to help us achieve or exceed these growth rates.

5.5 It begins by sketching out the global economic and political environment. The first section delves into the reality of geo-economic fragmentation and examines its implications for global growth. The second section outlines the case for acknowledging the elephant [and the dragon] in the room that will have a bearing on the growth projections  -  fundamental  shifts  in  the  global  economic  order  combined  with China's manufacturing prowess and strategic dominance. The third section probes into  a  key  channel  of  the  slightly  less  acknowledged  but  critical  aspect  of  China's dominance, viz., dependency of the global economy on it for energy transition efforts. India has ambitious goals for energy transition despite being one of the lowest per capita emitters of greenhouse gases. Dependence on China-made goods to achieve that transition enhances the complexity of the challenge for India. The fourth section sheds light on the need to focus on domestic growth levers for India, given the global context and challenges outlined. It makes a case for trusting the ingenuity of people and organisations and using policy to enhance their economic freedoms, which will give impetus to growth in line with the projections of WEO. The last section takes a deep dive into specific aspects of systematic deregulation that need to be focussed on to facilitate economic freedom for individuals and businesses so that India's mediumterm growth prospects remain strong.

## GEO-ECONOMIC FRAGMENTATION - THIS TIME MAY BE DIFFERENT

5.6 In  one  of  his  seminal  pieces,  ' The  Economic  Consequences  of  Peace ',  John Maynard  Keynes  writes  about  early  twentieth-century  London,  ' the  inhabitant of  London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages '.

5.7 Keynes  was  describing  a  state  of  affairs  not  unlike  the  one  to  which  we  have become  accustomed  over  the  past  few  decades  of  hyper-globalisation,  wherein  the flows of capital, goods, services, and people have transformed our world, helped by the  spread  of  new  technologies  and  ideas.  These  forces  of  integration  have  boosted productivity and living standards, tripling the size of the global economy and lifting 1.3 billion people out of extreme poverty.

5.8 However, just  like  Keynes'  description  of  how  the  prosperity  of  Londoner  was destroyed  by  ' the  projects  and  politics  of  militarism  and  imperialism,  of  racial and  cultural  rivalries,  of  monopolies,  restrictions,  and  exclusion ',  we  can  draw uncomfortable parallels with the present-day era wherein the global economy is once again confronted with the challenge of geo-economic fragmentation (GEF). This time, it is of a scale, scope and complexity that is likely more severe in its impact than what the world witnessed in the early 20th century.

- 5.9 The decades since the 1980s have witnessed significant globalisation, marked by remarkable shifts in global trade, investment, and economic activity. Here are some key statistics:

Global trade growth: In 1980, global trade accounted for about 39 per cent of world GDP. By 2012, this share had risen to 60 per cent, reflecting the deep integration of global markets.

Foreign direct investment (FDI): Global FDI inflows grew from USD 54 billion in 1980 to over USD 1.5 trillion in 2019, showcasing the increasing role of multinational corporations in cross-border investments.

Economic growth and poverty reduction: The global economy grew from USD 11 trillion in 1980 to over USD 100 trillion in 2022 (nominal).

Extreme poverty rates (those living on less than USD 2.15 a day) fell from 42 per cent of the global population in 1981 to 8.4 per cent in 2019, driven by rapid economic growth in countries like China and India.

## Global population and urbanisation:

The global population grew from 4.4 billion in 1980 to 8 billion in 2022, with urbanisation rates rising from 39 per cent in 1980 to 57 per cent in 2022, fuelling economic activity and connectivity.

Internet penetration: In 1980, internet connectivity was virtually non-existent. By 2022, over 5.3 billion people, or 66 per cent of the global population, had access to the internet, revolutionising communication, trade, and innovation.

These  statistics  illustrate  the  profound  changes  globalisation  has  brought,  driving economic integration and altering the global economic landscape. But, the next two decades are more likely to be about economic fragmentation.

5.10   Aiyar et  al .  (2023) 3 define  'geo-economic  fragmentation'  as  a  policy-driven reversal  of  global  economic  integration  often  guided  by  strategic  considerations. This process encompasses different channels, including trade, capital, and migration

flows. 4  Despite the benefits of integration, hyper-globalisation has also brought about associated  complacencies.  People  have  been  left  behind  as  industries  have  changed amid global competition. Rising geopolitical tensions and the breakout of war have further intensified these underlying fissures in the global economy.

5.11  In a re-enactment of the cold war era, countries are once again getting grouped into  two  blocs  and  phrases  like  friend-shoring  have  come  to  play  centre-stage  in global  policymaking.  Tensions  over  trade,  technology  standards,  and  security  have been  growing  for  many  years,  undermining  growth  and  trust  in  the  current  global economic system. Therefore, fragmentation - economic, social and cultural - is a direct consequence of the imposition of a 'one-size-fits-all' emission, as well as social and labour standards by western nations. These developments have growth implications.

## Growth implications of geo-economic fragmentation

5.12   The consequences and costs of GEF are propagated via all the channels whereby countries engage with each other economically. Trade is the main channel through which fragmentation is reshaping the global economy. The capacity of trade to incentivise within-industry  reallocation  and  generate  productivity  gains  is  getting  increasingly stifled. This is most evident in the increase in the trade-restrictive measures imposed by countries. As per figures released by the World Trade Organization (WTO) as part of the WTO Director-General's annual overview of global trade developments, there is a sharp rise in the coverage of trade-restrictive measures by WTO members between mid-October  2023  and  mid-October  2024,  compared  to  the  last  Trade  Monitoring Report in November 2023 [Chart V.2].

5.13    As  per  estimates,  the  value  of  trade  covered  by  the  169  new  trade-restrictive measures introduced between October 2023 and October 2024 is USD 887.7 billion, which is  half  a  trillion  dollars  more  than  the  value  of  trade  covered  by  restrictions introduced in the preceding year, which stood at USD 337.1 billion. 5  IMF 6  observes that trade fragmentation is much more costly this time because, unlike the start of the cold war when goods trade to GDP was 16 per cent, now that ratio is 45 per cent. Less trade implies less knowledge diffusion, a key benefit of integration, which could also be reduced by fragmentation of cross-border direct investment. One way to visualise trade restrictiveness is to quantify the trade coverage of new import-restrictive measures, apart from the number of restrictive measures presented earlier (Chart V.2) 7 .

5.14  The impact of GEF is seen in global FDI flows, which are increasingly concentrated among geopolitically aligned countries, particularly in strategic sectors. This relocation of FDI increases the vulnerability of several emerging markets and developing economies. The output losses associated with this FDI relocation emerging from friend-shoring and re-shoring are especially severe for emerging markets and developing economies. They face heightened restrictions from advanced economies, which are their major sources of FDI. 8

5.15    Depending  on  the  modelling  assumptions,  it  is  estimated  that  the  cost  to global output from trade fragmentation could range from 0.2 per cent (in a limited fragmentation/low-cost adjustment scenario) up to 7 per cent of the GDP (in a high fragmentation/high-cost  adjustment  scenario).  When  we  add  likely  technological decoupling to the mix, the output loss is predicted to be as high as 8-12 per cent of GDP in select countries. The overarching impact of such a denouement would mean that as the global economy slows down, global capital tends to look for economies with sustainable growth.
