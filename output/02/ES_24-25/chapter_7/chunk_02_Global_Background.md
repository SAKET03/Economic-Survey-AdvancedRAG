# Global Background

## GLOBAL BACKGROUND

7.1 In the global manufacturing space, high-income countries have lost a significant part of their share during the last decade 1 . This was largely gained by the upper middleincome countries, mainly based on China's strength. The share of lower middle-income economies did not, in general, increase. Yet, India managed to improve its share in the pie and global presence.

7.2 However, with 2.8 per cent of the global share in manufacturing, compared to China's  28.8  per  cent,  India  has  a  large  opportunity  to  climb  up  the  ladder 2 (chart VII.1(a)). India also has a substantial scope to improve the contribution of the industrial sector in GDP in relation to its comparator countries (chart VII.2(b)). More so in the

light of the IMF's observation 3   that manufacturing production is increasingly shifting towards emerging market economies, particularly China and India. India stands a good chance of benefitting from the trends in global industrial diversification 4 .

7.3 While this remains an upside of possibility, the downside stems partially from the increasing risks of industrial and trade policy measures by the countries faced with external competition and internal weaknesses. There are also early global indications that,  given  elevated  commodity  price  trends,  consumption  is  tilting  away  from manufactured items and more towards services.

As a result, the global manufacturing output rose modestly by 0.4 per cent only in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a stronger growth of nearly 1 per cent in the previous quarter 6 . Hence, in a rather unsupportive global environment, it calls for lasting, coordinated efforts from all tiers of government, the private sector, the skilling ecosystem, academia and R&amp;D institutions, as well as financial stakeholders to enable India to realise its ambition as a manufacturing powerhouse.
