# Appropriate Policies Likely to Bring in Greater Equity in State-Wise Patterns in Industrial Production

## APPROPRIATE POLICIES LIKELY TO BRING IN GREATER EQUITY IN STATE-WISE PATTERNS IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION

7.42   Developmental  disparities  across  States  have  always  been  a  matter  of  keen attention, bringing convergence of per capita incomes and living standards to policy focus.  However,  convergence  does  not  mean  convergence  in  every  sector,  because different states will have comparative advantages in different sectors-be it dairying &amp; farming, manufacturing, conventional or medical tourism, software, financial sector or any other activity. Coastal states can do better in industrialisation and exports.

7.43   Even  while  recognising  this,  the  Survey  presents  inter-state  differences  in industrialisation in this Chapter.  Disparities in  service  sector  developments  are presented  in  Chapter  8.  As  shown  by  the  national  account  statistics,  in  FY23  about 84.7 per cent of GVA (at constant prices 2011-12) in the country is generated by industrial and service activities together, with an inter-state 30 variation (chart VII.16) 31 . And hence, sustained improvements in productivity and growth in one or more service or industrial sectors is inescapable for overall development of states. This is true of even states that have an advantage in agricultural activities. This is because, dynamic industrial and service sectors can help to move and productively employ the surplus manpower in agriculture, apart from generating additional intermediate and final demand for farm output.

7.44   Four  states-the  western  states  of  Gujarat  and  Maharashtra  and  the  southern states  of  Karnataka  and  Tamil  Nadu-  account  for  about  43  per  cent  of  the  total industrial GSVA. (In this section, industrial GSVA refers to the year FY23 at constant 2011-12 prices; population refers to figures used by the respective State Directorates of  Economics &amp; Statistics for their GSDP calculations). In contrast, six states of the Northeast (excluding Sikkim and Assam), account for only 0.7 per cent of the industrial GVA. There is a need for focus on industrial strategies appropriate to unique geographies like the North East.

7.45  In chart VII.17, states are placed and colour-coded in three categories based on their position relative to the overall average in the share of industrial and its component GVA (FY23 at constant prices). States with industrial share higher/lower by 25 per cent of  the  national  average  are  'Green'  and  'Red'  respectively.  States  around  the  overall average are yellow. The intent is to only understand whether there is a fairly balanced pattern in the share of industry and its components in the overall GSVA of each State. However, as observed in para 7.43, the observed patterns reflect, to a great extent, the

comparative advantages of States. 32  There is no strong conspicuous regional pattern visible in terms of industrial dependence, except to an extent in the Eastern region.

(*) Note: All State average of the share of industrial GVA is 33.2 per cent; mining: 2.8 per cent; manufacturing: 19 per cent; electricity: 2.5 per cent; and, construction: 8.9 per cent. The shares are in constant prices. The all-State average may not match with the national average.

7.46   High level of dependence on industrial sectors does not necessarily reflect high level of industrial development. Thus, concealed within the state shares are the variations in per capita industrial GSVA. The chart VII.18 presents four quadrants demarcated by the all-state average in the share of industrial sector in State's total GVA and their

per capita industrial GSVA. There are clear patterns in the degree of industrialisation emerging from chart VII.18. Only a few States like Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh  are  able  to  cash  on  their  high  level  of  dependence  on  industrial  sector  to generate reasonable levels of incomes for their people. Chart VII.18 also shows that few states have high levels of dependence on industrial sector with low income generation while states in eastern and northern region are least industrialised.

7.47    Construction activity, closely linked with infrastructure development, urbanization and real  estate  trends,  also  shows  inter-state  differences.  At  one  extreme,  Kerala  is comparatively less industrial than many other States (chart VII.18), but it is a positive outlier in construction activity (chart VII.19), with construction contributing about half of its industrial GVA.

7.48  The industrial patterns shown by many States reflect their comparative advantages. However, as shown by charts VII.18 &amp; VII.19, in the case of many States, it signifies dependence  on  relatively  low  income  generating  industrial  activities,  hampering movement of surplus labour in agriculture and structural transformation.

7.49  The mining sector contributes about 8 per cent to the total industrial output. On expected lines, the mining activity is highly concentrated with top five states that is Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Odisha, accounting for about 60 per cent of the all-State mining GSVA.

7.50   Ramaswamy  (2019) 33 ,  in  his  study  on  concentration  of  manufacturing  units and  workers  across  states,  suggested  that  among  States,  there  was  no  decline  in concentration in the registered sector but there was a decline in concentration in the unregistered sector. Data from Annual Survey of Industries for FY23 for the factory sector and the data on unincorporated manufacturing enterprises (from ASUSE Survey for FY23) show vast inter-State disparities in the number of factories/enterprises per person in different states (chart VII.20). Among the bigger states, Tamil Nadu leads the pack with the highest concentration of factories per person, followed by Gujarat. Bihar hardly has any factories, while Uttar Pradesh hardly has any smaller enterprises.

7.51   The very weak relation between the state-wise patterns in factories per person and  unincorporated  manufacturing  establishments  per  person  indicates  that  some States low in the factory sector activity have considerable presence of unincorporated enterprises. It is an opportunity for those States to recognise, nurture and increase the durability and scales of their smaller enterprises, with appropriate policy facilitation and deregulation.

7.52  Research papers that examine the factors affecting industrial progress in States, highlighted that state-level policies play a crucial role in shaping the economic growth patterns  across  Indian  states  (IMF,  2006) 34 .    Another  early  study  (Debnarayan  et al.,  2011) 35     suggested that Indian states that implemented significant economic and administrative  reforms  during  the  reform  period  reaped  the  benefits  of  industrial expansion.  Factors  like  regulatory  environment,  infrastructure  development,  and state-level  reforms  are  shown  to  significantly  influence  industrial  growth  patterns. Shiladitya  Chatterjee  (2022) 36 shows  that  the  state  level  industrial  growth  drivers are infrastructure, human development and policy and institutional environment for industrial development.

7.53   The  Business  Reform  Action  Plan  (BRAP)  formulated  by  the  Department  for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade aims to assess and enhance the ease of doing business across states. As per the BRAP 2020, states are categorised into four groups in terms of ease of doing business, i.e., top achievers, achievers, aspirers and emerging business eco-systems. Chart VII.21 shows a positive correspondence between business reforms and the level of industrial activity, suggesting the need for deregulation and enterprise-friendly reforms in aspiring and emerging states 37 .

## BOX-VII.5: Tamil Nadu's Strategic Initiatives to Foster Footwear Manufacturing Growth

Tamil Nadu is a leader in the traditional leather sector and now championing the growth of non-leather footwear. The state contributes to 38 per cent share in India's footwear and leather  products  output,  contributing  to  about  47  per  cent  share  in  India's  total  leather export. This sector generates more than 2 lakh employment. Tamil Nadu (TN) also houses technical  and  academic  institutions  like  Central  Leather  Research  Institute,  Council  for Leather Exports, Footwear Design and Development Institute.

Some of the major initiatives taken by Tamil Nadu Government to attract large footwear manufacturers in the recent years are listed below:

- The State has focused on developing industrial estates in rural areas to ensure access to a ready workforce, particularly women. These efforts have attracted foreign investors, such as Feng Tey from Taiwan, who set up contract manufacturing for Nike.
- It  has  identified  land  in  districts  like  Madurai  and  Sivagangai  for  future  footwear investments, ensuring land availability for potential manufacturers.
-  TN's investment promotion agency, namely, Guidance, has made concerted investment promotion activities. Guidance actively liaised with Taiwanese agencies to strengthen ties with  potential  investors  in  footwear  sector.  Guidance  established  contacts  with  major contract  manufacturers  of  Nike  like  Pou  Chen,  Hong  Fu,  Taekwang  and  Changshin, positioning Tamil Nadu as an attractive destination for manufacturing.

- The  External  Engagement  Cell  in  Guidance  prepares  publicity  material  in  foreign languages like Mandarin, Japanese and Korean; it is now being prepared in German and French as well for smooth communication.
- A  dedicated  investment  facilitator  is  assigned  to  each  investor.  The  entire  clearance process and operational issues after commencement of production are managed through this single point of contact. This has enhanced the reputation of TN as an investment friendly state.
- The  agency  has  a  division  called  WorkLabs  which  is  a  dedicated  industry-academia coordination cell to actively engage industry in curriculum reform and familiarise new companies entering Tamil Nadu with the talent ecosystem of the State.
- It has also appointed regional officers for various parts of the State, who are based in Tier II towns like Madurai, Coimbatore and Tirunelveli.
- The incentive package system offered in Tamil Nadu is flexible and can be tailored to the needs of each investor. Tamil Nadu offers a range of incentives such as capital subsidies, payroll subsidies, and land cost subsidies. The state has launched a dedicated Footwear and Leather Products Policy 2022, which aims to develop a comprehensive ecosystem that supports both large manufacturers and smaller enterprises.

7.54  There is a close connection between industrial and service sectors, as indicated by the increasing 'servicification' of industrial output and exports. 38 Goldar et al. (2017) also indicated that services inputs contribute significantly to export intensity of Indian manufacturing firms. Hence, it is important that States focus on business reforms on a priority basis so as to achieve buoyancies in some industrial or service sectors where it  has  natural  advantages. States should make it easier for businesses to commence operations,  to  grow  and  even  be  closed,  if  deemed  inevitable  by  the  entrepreneur. Allowing economic activity as far as possible and getting out of the way will foster faster convergence of living standards and per capita incomes. The route taken by different states will be different and will necessarily have to be so.
