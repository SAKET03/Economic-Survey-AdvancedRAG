## CONCLUSION

12.84. In conclusion, India has seen good growth in employment in recent years, as highlighted  by  labour  market  indicators  that  show  strong  signs  of  post-pandemic recovery and increased formalisation of the economy. This growth can be attributed to notable achievements in entrepreneurship, formalisation, skill development, and the transformation of the regulatory framework.

12.85. Labour laws intended to protect the rights of women workers have, more often than  not,  discouraged  hiring  by  creating  systemic  barriers  to  their  entry  into  the workforce. India's new Labour Codes address this by enabling night shifts for women with safety measures, extending 26 weeks of maternity leave to gig and informal workers and mandating creche facilities in workplaces with 50 or more employees. The Codes ensure  equal  pay  and  prohibit  gender  discrimination  in  recruitment  while  allowing women to work in all sectors, including hazardous roles, with safeguards. These reforms will promote gender inclusivity, workplace safety, and social security for women.

12.86. By simplifying compliance, fostering labour flexibility, and promoting worker welfare, labour reforms have created an enabling environment that balances ease of doing business with the protection of worker rights. Together, these measures foster a  'virtuous  cycle  of  job  creation,'  supporting  sustainable  employment  growth  and economic inclusivity. Chapter 5 of the survey 'Medium Term Outlook' discusses in detail the important role of deregulation in the economy. Deregulation, in general, whether or not related to labour, will boost employment because it helps lower the cost of doing business and allows for the resource to be used for expanding capacity through more labour and more and better equipment.
