## MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS

2.3 The primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while also considering the goal of economic growth, as stable prices are essential for sustainable growth. The RBI employs various policy instruments, such as manoeuvring the interest rates, conducting open market operations (OMO), altering the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), etc, to achieve this stability.

2.4 During the first nine months of FY25 (April 2024-December 2024), the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the RBI, in its various meetings, decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent. Until its August 2024 meeting, the committee retained its stance on the 'withdrawal of accommodation' to ensure inflation aligns with the target while supporting growth. Considering the prevailing and expected inflationgrowth dynamics, the committee, in its October 2024 meeting, decided to change the policy  stance  from  the  'withdrawal  of  accommodation'  to  'neutral'.  In  its  December 2024 meeting, the MPC announced a cut in CRR to 4 per cent of the net demand and

time liabilities (NDTL) from 4.5 per cent. The decision is expected to infuse around â‚¹1.16 lakh crore liquidity in the banking system. 1

2.5 Examining the trend in various measures of money supply in the economy, viz., different aggregates that reflect varying degrees of liquidity, it is seen that the monetary base, viz. the most liquid form of money, M0, recorded a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 3.6 per cent as of 3 January 2025, compared to 6.3 per cent a year ago. The growth in M3, excluding the impact of the merger of a non-bank with a bank (with effect from 1 July 2023), was 9.3 per cent (YoY) as of 27 December 2024, compared to 11 per cent a year ago. Component-wise 2 , aggregate deposits were the most significant component and contributed most to the expansion of M3. Amongst sources 3 , bank credit to the commercial sector was a major contributor to the increase in M3. As of 27 December 2024, MM 4 , i.e., the ratio of M3 to M0, stood at 5.7 against 5.5 a year ago. Adjusted for reverse repo amounts, analytically akin to banks' deposits with the central bank, the adjusted MM was lower at 5.6 as of 27 December 2024.

4  The money multiplier measures the maximum amount of money that a banking system generates with each unit of central bank money.

2.6 A country's MM is influenced by two main factors: - the amount of cash individuals (and businesses) hold and the reserves that banks maintain. When individuals keep more cash, the banking system cannot create money, resulting in a lower multiplier. In this case, cash in hand acts as a leakage from the banking system. Similarly, the reserves that banks hold with the central bank also count as a leakage, further decreasing the MM. In India's case, banks hold a portion of their deposits as reserves with the RBI, known as CRR.

2.7 A higher MM indicates that the banking system is generating a greater money supply from the money provided by the central bank. In India, recent efforts to promote financial inclusion have encouraged people to hold less cash in hand relative to their deposits, which partly explains the increase in the MM. Chart II.2 shows that MM has been on an upward trend over the years. It declined during the COVID-19 pandemic as increased economic uncertainty caused individuals to increase their cash holdings, resulting in a fall. However, after FY22, it has resumed its upward trajectory, reflecting enhanced liquidity generation in the economy.
