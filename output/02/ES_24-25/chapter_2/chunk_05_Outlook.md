## OUTLOOK

2.88   India's  financial  sector  has  performed  well  amidst  unfavourable  geopolitical conditions. On the monetary front, system liquidity, represented by the net position under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility, remained in surplus during October-November 2024. The financial parameters of banks continue to be strong, reflected in improved profitability indicators. The gap between the growth of credit and deposits of SCBs has

narrowed, with deposits keeping pace with loan growth. Capital markets significantly contribute to capital formation, the financialisation of domestic savings, and wealth creation. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals, healthy corporate earnings, supportive institutional  investment,  robust  inflows  from  SIPs,  and  increased  formalisation, digitisation, and accessibility have all fuelled the market's continued growth. India's insurance  sector  is  performing  well  and  is  projected  to  become  the  fastest-growing market among G20 nations over the next five years (2024-2028). The pension sector is expected to grow as the economy transitions from a lower-middle-income to an uppermiddle-income country.

2.89  The financial sector is witnessing a moment of positive flux, with several changes taking shape. Firstly, there is a rise in the share of consumer credit in overall credit extended by banks. 105   Between FY14 and FY24, the share of consumer credit in total bank credit increased from 18.3 per cent to 32.4 per cent. 106  Secondly, there has been a rise in non-bank-based financing in recent years. Banks' share in total credit has declined from 77 per cent in FY11 to 58 per cent in FY22. 107  Simultaneously, there has been a rise in NBFCs and bond market financing. Thirdly, equity-based financing has catapulted to popularity, with IPO listings growing six times between FY13 and FY24 and India being ranked first globally in terms of the number of IPO listings in FY24. 108 Young investors are also driving the equity boom under the age of 30. As a report by the NSE notes that between March 2018 to September 2024, the proportion of young investors surged from 23 per cent to 40 per cent. 109

2.90  These emerging trends mark the dawn of a new era for India's financial sector. However,  they  also  bring  regulatory  challenges  and  potential  risks  that  cannot be  overlooked.  One  critical  risk  to  guard  against  is  the  dominance  of  financial markets  in  shaping  policy  and  macroeconomic  outcomes,  a  phenomenon  known as  'financialisation.'  The  consequences  of  financialisation  are  evident  in  advanced economies, where it has led to unprecedented levels of public and private sector debtsome visible to regulators and some not. Economic growth in such contexts becomes overly reliant on rising asset prices to offset leverage, exacerbating inequality and asset  market  considerations  that  may  overly  influence  public  policies,  particularly regulatory  ones.  As  India  strives  to  align  its  financial  system  with  its  economic aspirations for 2047, she should strive to maintain the fine balance between financial

sector development and growth on the one hand and financialisation on the other. It means that the country has to chart its path with respect to its context, considering the levels of financial savings in households, its investment needs, and levels of financial literacy.  Ensuring  that  incentives  in  the  sector  are  consistent  with  national  growth aspirations is a policy imperative.
