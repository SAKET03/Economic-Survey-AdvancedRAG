## DOMESTIC INFLATION

## Softening core inflation cools headline inflation

4.7.  India's  headline  inflation,  measured  by  the  Consumer  Price  Index  (CPI),  has moderated  in  FY25  (April-December)  compared  to  FY24.  This  decline  is  primarily due to a significant decrease in core inflation, which dropped by 0.9 percentage points between FY24 and FY25 (April-December). The sharp decline in core inflation was largely driven by core services inflation, which was lower than core goods inflation. A decrease in fuel price inflation has also contributed to the moderation in headline inflation, alleviating pressure on household budgets. In general, the decline in retail inflation can be attributed to a reduction in input prices, as reflected in wholesale price inflation, which was in the deflationary zone (-0.7 per cent) in FY24 and remained low in FY25 (April-December).

## Food Inflation is majorly driven by very few food items

4.8.  Over the past two years, India's food inflation rate has remained firm, diverging from global trends of stable or declining food inflation. This can be attributed to factors such as supply chain disruptions exacerbated by extreme weather events and reduced harvest of some food items.

4.9.  Food inflation, measured by the CFPI, faced pressures in FY25 (April-December), primarily driven by a few food items such as vegetables and pulses. Vegetables and pulses together holds a total weightage of 8.42 per cent in CPI basket. However, their contribution to the overall inflation stood at 32.3 per cent in FY25 (April to December). When these items are excluded, the average food inflation rate for FY25 (April-December) was 4.3 per cent, which is 4.1 per cent lower than the overall food inflation. Similarly, the average headline inflation would be 3.2 per cent when the vegetables and pulses inflation rate were excluded, 1.7 per cent lower than the actual headline inflation.

4.10.  Uneven  monsoon-induced  supply  disruptions  in  certain  regions  caused  price pressures,  mainly  in  tomatoes  and  onions,  contributing  to  higher  inflation  rates  in vegetables and overall food inflation. When we exclude the three most price-sensitive vegetables (tomato, onion and potato (TOP)) from the CPI basket, the average food inflation rate in FY25 (April-December) was 6.5 per cent, which is 1.9 per cent lower than the current food inflation. Similarly, average headline inflation is 4.2 per cent when excluding TOP, which is 0.7 per cent lower than the current headline inflation. Given that  tomato and onion prices have been drivers of food inflation, and consequently headline inflation in recent months, the next section will explore the causes  of price pressure in these vegetables.

## Extreme weather conditions impact vegetable production and prices

4.11 Vegetables are more susceptible to uneven weather compared to food grains, as highlighted by various studies. Extreme weather events such as cyclones, heavy rains, floods,  thunderstorms,  hailstorms,  and  droughts  impact  vegetable  prices.  Further, evidence  indicates  that  inflationary  pressure  in  horticultural  commodities  in  202324 was driven by unseasonal rainfall during the pre-monsoon season, which damaged crops  in  major  horticulture-producing  states 3 .  The  coexistence  of  good  areas  sown coupled with greater price volatility suggests that extreme weather events significantly impact production and supply chains, thereby affecting retail prices.

4.12.  The  data  accessed  from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Ministry of  Earth  Sciences  indicates  a  notable  increase  in  the  frequency  of  extreme  weather conditions, particularly heatwaves. On an average, during 2022-2024, India experienced heatwaves on 18 per cent of days compared to 5 per cent of days in 2020 and 2021.

4.13.   Data published by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and Down to Earth (DTE) 5,6   finds that the total crop area damaged in 2024 was higher compared to the last two years due to extreme weather events.

4.14.  The  increasing  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events-specifically  uneven  and unseasonal rainfall and heat waves -  impacts vegetable production, thereby increasing prices. These adverse weather conditions also present significant challenges to storage and transportation, resulting in temporary disruptions to the supply chain and causing an increase in vegetable prices. This phenomenon is also corroborated by a positive correlation between the frequency of extreme weather events occurring within a given month  and  the  vegetable  inflation  rates  observed  in  the  subsequent  months,  with notable effects evident for up to three months following such events.

4.15.   Furthermore, the fall in onion and tomato production in the last two years can be  partially  explained  by  higher  extreme  weather  events  in  major  producing  states compared to other regions.

## Trends in onion and tomato production and prices

4.16. The inflationary pressures in onion remained firm in FY24 and the current year, despite  prompt measures by the government to contain prices due to constrained supply  resulting  from  reduced  production.  Onions  are  grown  in  both  the  Kharif and Rabi seasons, with around 70 per cent of production occurring during the Rabi season 7 . Fresh onions generally last about 2-3 months when stored in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place, with their shelf life further extendable under a dehumidified environment. Thus, onions produced in one year - specifically Rabi onions harvested from March onwards are typically available for consumption in the following year, influencing  inflation  dynamics  in  that  year.The  lower  production  in  2022-23  and 2023-24 has consequently led to inflationary pressures in onions for FY24 and FY25 (April-December)(Chart IV.6b).

4.17.  The price pressures in tomatoes remained intermittently high since FY23 due to constrained supply (Chart IV.6a). This occurred despite earnest efforts by the government to improve supply conditions in deficient regions by procuring from producing regions. The inflation dynamics of tomatoes are influenced by multiple factors. Unlike onions, tomatoes have short crop cycles and are highly perishable, creating challenges in storage and transportation and leading to supply shortages and price spikes. Fresh tomatoes have a shelf life of only about 1-2 weeks when stored properly. Tomato production is mainly concentrated in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Odisha. This regional concentration makes the supply chain vulnerable to disruptions in any of these areas. Similar to onions, a major portion of tomato production - more than 65 per cent 8 - occurs in the Rabi season.

## Consumption and seasonality in production of onion and tomato

4.18.  Analysis of production and consumption trends over the past three years shows that domestic household consumption is lower than production for both tomatoes and onions. Horticultural Statistics at Glance 2021 9 , indicates that approximately 15 per cent of production is used for bulk consumption in hotels, marriages etc. Even while treating this as a net additionality to household consumption, the production is still higher.  Therefore,  it  turns  out  that  price  pressures  are  not  fundamentally  due  to  a shortfall in production but to post-harvest losses, seasonal production, and regional dispersion in production. Also, onion exports averaged more than 6 per cent of domestic production during FY20 to FY24.

4.19.    For  instance,  tomato  prices  typically  rise  from  July  to  September,  the  lean production  season  coinciding  with  the  monsoon,  adding  to  challenges  related  to distribution  and  increased  transit  losses.  Onion  prices  tend  to  increase  from  October to  December,  representing  a  lean  season  for  onion  production.  India's  status  as  the major producer and consumer of onion and tomato significantly limits the potential to import during times of seasonal supply and demand imbalances. Given that India and China contribute about half of the total production of onion 10 , the import options for India  during  periods  of  demand-supply  imbalances  are  quite  limited.  The  next  eight major producing countries only contribute around 18 per cent of the production. Also, the highly perishable nature of tomatoes restricts import options from neighbouring countries, which are not significant producers of tomatoes. Consequently, India faces challenges in importing these essential commodities.

## Trends in production and inflation rate of tur

4.20.  In addition to tomato and onion, tur dal also contibuted to food inflation in India. The deficient production of tur in 2022-23 and 2023-24 has indeed led to high price pressures in tur dal during FY24 and FY25 (April-December), despite various measures by the government to shore up the supply in consuming regions. Production declined by 13.6 per cent in 2022-23 and 10.8 per cent in 2023-24 compared to the last 5-year average, affecting the supply. Over the past decade, there has been a strong negative correlation (-0.8) between the annual inflation rate and the 1-year lagged production, indicating that lower production in one year typically results in higher inflation in the following year. As a major Kharif pulse, tur is harvested from November to January, with its price impact mainly observed in the subsequent financial year.

4.21.    Despite  these  challenges,  the  government  is  actively  working  to  ensure  an adequate supply of tur dal to consumers. To ensure that the produced quantity reaches the market and to prevent stockpiling, the government is taking proactive measures by periodically imposing stock limits for tur, and active monitoring through the stock disclosure portal. Further, to meet the demand for tur, the country imported 7.7 lakh tonnes of tur in FY24, mainly from Mozambique, Tanzania, Malawi, and Myanmar.
