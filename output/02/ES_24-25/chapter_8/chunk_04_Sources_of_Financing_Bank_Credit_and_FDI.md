NITI  Aayog  working  paper  on  'Identifying  Potential  Service  Sub-Sectors:  Insights  from GVA, Exports, and Employment Data' studies the potential of services in transforming the Indian economy from various dimensions such as the contribution to output /value added, employment and exports. Based on the analysis of the performance of the various service sub-sectors on these key dimensions, services are classified into four categories each with its own set of policy recommendations: defend, accelerate, transform, and untapped.

8.13  In view of the rising passenger traffic, the government is taking various steps to upgrade passenger amenities. Out of a total of 7,325 railway stations across the nation, train indication boards have been provided at 1351 stations, coach guidance systems at 866 stations, digital clocks at 5605 stations, and public address systems at 6071 stations as of November 2024. Wi-Fi facility has been provided at 6112 stations to date. A new policy for the management of mobile catering services was introduced in 2023. As of date, 557 base kitchens have been commissioned catering to 468 pairs of trains.

8.14  As a result of the push toward digitalization in IR, E-ticketing has touched 86 per cent in the reserved sector as of October 2024. Ticketing through digital means in the unreserved sector has increased from 28 per cent at the beginning of the current financial  year  to  around  33  per  cent  in  October  2024.  IR  has  also  transformed  the refund process enabling refunds in eligible cases within 24 hours in around 98 per cent of cases. Dynamic QR code-based payment has been enabled across all the counters. The passenger reservation system is being redeveloped using cloud-native technologies.

The new application will have features like high scalability, high performance, high availability, high level of security, ease of operations, and high agility.

8.15   To  encourage  tourism,  Bharat  gaurav  trains  have  been  introduced  as  themebased tourist circuit trains that showcase India's rich cultural heritage and magnificent historical places. Under this scheme, the service provider is to provide comprehensive tour  services  comprising  meals,  accommodation,  transport,  sightseeing,  tour  guide, etc. As of date, a total of 325 trips of Bharat gaurav trains carrying 1,91,033 tourists have been operated covering various tourist destinations.

## Road transport

8.16   Road  transport  generates  the  highest  GVA  within  transport  services.  During FY23, road transport accounted for 78 per cent of the total GVA of transport services. Enhancing user  convenience  on  national  highways  is  central  to  the  growth  of  road transport.  In this direction, the government has moved from traditional ways of tolling to  digitised  tolling  by  adopting  electronic  toll  collection  through  FASTag.  This  has reduced the average waiting time at toll plazas from 734 seconds to 47 seconds 10 . The government has targeted the rollout of barrier-free tolling on all four lane plus NHs and high-speed corridors by FY29. The government has planned to establish more than one thousand wayside amenities in the next five years to provide world-class facilities and amenities to highway users in line with global standards along the NHs at every 40-60 kms on both sides.

8.17   In  a  major  step  towards  road  safety,  the  government  has  formulated  a comprehensive strategy to improve road safety standards on NHs. A cashless treatment scheme for road accident victims has been initiated. Institute of driving training and research, regional driving training centres, and driving training centres at the state/ district level have been set up. The government is also working towards road safety through  initiatives  like  supporting  truck  driver  health  with  the  Abhay  project,  and providing eye tests and health checks for drivers.

## Aviation: flying high

8.18   India  is  the  fastest-growing  aviation  market  globally.  To  accommodate  the substantial growth in air traffic, Indian airlines have placed amongst the largest orders for aircraft globally.

About â‚¹ 60.6 crore have been disbursed under the PLI scheme to support drone manufacturing.
- As  of  November  30,  2024,  32  aircraft  leasing  entities  (including  provisional)  have registered  in  the  GIFT-IFSC,  leasing  105  aviation  assets,  including  53  aircraft  and  52 engines.
- On July  12,  2024,  the  government  announced  a  uniform  5  per  cent  integrated  goods and  services  tax  on  imported  aircraft  parts  and  tools,  applicable  regardless  of  HSN classification.

8.20 The PM Gati Shakti initiative aims to create a seamless multimodal connectivity network across the country. Under this initiative, the aviation sector is being integrated with other modes of transport, such as railways, roads, and waterways.
