# Prices and Inflation: Successful Tight-Rope Walking

## Prices and inflation: successful tight-roPe Walking

Consumer price inflation in India went through three phases in 2022. A rising phase up to April 2022 when it crested at 7.8 per cent, then a holding pattern at around 7.0 per cent up to August 2022 and then a decline to around 5.7 per cent by December 2022. The rising phase was largely due to the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war and a shortfall in crop harvests due to excessive heat in some parts of the country. Prompt and adequate measures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have reined in the rise in inflation and brought it within the Central Bank's tolerance limit. In contrast, major Western countries, which pumped stimulus during the pandemic periods, continue to grapple with high levels of inflation.

The  divergence  between  a  relatively  high  Wholesale  Price  Index  (WPI)  inflation  and lower Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation widened in May 2022 primarily owing to a difference in relative weights of the two indices and the lagged effect of imported input costs on retail prices. However, the gap between the two measures of inflation has reduced since  then,  demonstrating  a  tendency  towards  convergence.  An  important  measure of  demand-pull  inflation  -  core  inflation  -  remains  sticky.  There  have  been  significant variations in retail inflation rates among the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India.

According to Housing Price Index (HPI) published by National Housing Bank (NHB), the overall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market price in Quarter Ending (QE) September 2022 over QE September 2021 indicates a revival in the housing finance sector.

RBI's  Monetary  Policy  Committee  increased  the  policy  repo  rate  under  the  liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 225 basis points from 4.0 per cent to 6.25 per cent between May and December 2022. Central Government has undertaken fiscal measures like reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, prohibition of the export of wheat products, imposition of export duty on rice, reduction in import duties and cess on pulses, rationalisation of tariffs and imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds, maintenance of buffer stock for onion and pulses and rationalisation of import duties on raw materials used in the manufactured products.

The RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term, owing to supply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike, reflecting high feed costs. In general, climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to food prices. A lot depends on industrial input prices: they may ease, but

on the flip  side,  their  delayed  pass-through  to  consumer  prices  may  contribute  to  the stickiness of core inflation.

In general, the year 2022 was marked by a return of high inflation in the advanced world after three to four decades, depending on the country. In India, the government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices. India's retail inflation rate peaked at 7.8 per cent in April 2022. The overshoot of inflation above the upper end of the target range in India was one of the lowest in the world. We are confident that authorities would remain vigilant and be as proactive as they were in 2022 should inflation pressures re-emerge in India in 2023.
