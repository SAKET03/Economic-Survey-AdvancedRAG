# Conclusion

## conclusion

3.41. The Government of India has adopted a holistic policy towards fiscal stability in the last few years. Using the crisis as an opportunity to bring about reforms, the government undertook a series of policy measures in the previous few years. These policies range from bringing in budget  transparency  and  using  prudent  assumptions  in  the  Budget  to  transforming  the  tax ecosystem by implementing technology, rationalising GST, reducing tax rates, simplifying tax compliances, and ending the uncertainty around retrospective taxation. All these measures have led to a greater formalisation of the economy, enhanced compliances and better reporting of the income by the public and imparted credibility to the government's commitment to fiscal management.

- 3.42. The  spike  in  India's  debt  and  deficit  ratios  has  not  only  been  due  to  higher  spending necessitated  by  the  pandemic-induced  cessation  of  economic  activity  but  also  due  to  the contraction or slower growth in the denominator (nominal GDP). In FY20, India's GDP growth slowed down due to the ongoing stress in the financial system. While the banking sector was undergoing repair and was recapitalising, the non-banking financial sector crisis renewed the uncertainties for the banking system. This kept credit growth muted, leading to slower GDP growth. 11  The pandemic aggravated the situation in FY21, which caused the nominal GDP to contract, a rare occurrence in India. A detailed discussion may be seen in Chapter 2.
- 3.43. As India's economic recovery advances, amidst the continuing global uncertainties and risks, the fiscal glide path illuminates the path for fiscal policy. That will ensure more significant fiscal space for policy action in uncertain times. Further, in reality, fiscal discipline translates into a fiscal stimulus for all sections of the economy through lower interest rates. As governments make their fiscal situations sustainable and stick to that path, the risk premium embedded in their interest rates comes down, thus lowering the cost of capital for all sections of society - on their educational loans, housing loans, car loans and business loans - and putting more money in their hands. For EMDE, the stimulus effect of fiscal deficit, via diminishing risk-premium, is likely greater than it is for advanced economies. That is the reality, as financial markets do not treat advanced and emerging economies similarly on fiscal deficits. Therefore, it stands to reason that they reap greater rewards for fiscal prudence. As stated earlier, this is particularly relevant in an era of rising interest rates.
- 3.44. The Centre should continue incentivising the States for reforms and higher capital spending to ensure a stronger General government. The capex-led growth strategy will ensure sustainable debt levels in the medium term.

## Annexe 2:  Indirect tax measures by CBIC during 2021-22

The  reforms  initiated  by  the  government  in  recent  years  have  ensured  the  development  of a  trust-based  tax  system.  Progress  has  been  made  to  move  to  an  efficient  and  effective  tax administration, which honours honest taxpayers and provides better taxpayer facilitation while advancing the government's policy of facilitating Ease of Doing Business.

## Ease of Compliance for Taxpayers

- A new scheme of updated return has been introduced in the Income-tax Act of 1961, which facilitates the taxpayer to voluntarily update his return anytime within two years from the end of the relevant assessment year by paying an additional tax. This scheme encourages voluntary compliance and reduces litigation.
- The scope of information in the pre-filled Income tax Returns (ITR) has been further expanded by including information such as house property income, capital gains from securities, bank interest, and dividends to make tax compliance more convenient.
- A new provision to effect business reorganisation has been made under the Income-tax Act, 1961, requiring the successor entity to file a modified return within six months of the order of the reorganisation being passed by the Competent Authority.
- The procedures for assessment, appeal and levy of penalty under the Income-tax Act have been made faceless by eliminating the human interface between the Assessing Officer and the assessee, optimising the use of resources through functional specialisation and streamlining the procedures to enable efficient implementation.

## Reduction in litigation

- A Dispute Resolution Committee is constituted to reduce litigation and give an impetus to dispute resolution for small taxpayers. A taxpayer having taxable income up to ₹50 lakh and disputed income up to ₹10 lakh shall be eligible to approach the Committee. The procedure of the Committee will be conducted electronically to ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability.
- Taking forward the policy of litigation management and to avoid repetitive appeals, a new provision  has  been  made  under  the  Income-tax Act,  1961,  wherein  if  a  question  of  law in  the  case  of  an  assessee  is  identical  to  a  question  of  law  pending  in  appeal  before  the jurisdictional High Court or the Supreme Court in his case or any other case, the filing of further appeal to the Appellate Tribunal or the jurisdictional High Court in the case of the assessee shall be deferred till such question of law is decided by the relevant Court subject to certain conditions.

## Measures undertaken to curb tax evasion &amp; facilitate the widening of the tax base

- A  formal  mechanism  of  sharing  information  through  the Annual  Information  Statement (AIS)  and  e-Verification  scheme  has  recently  been  enabled.  These  measures  further  the aim of widening and deepening the tax base by ensuring authorities possess all relevant financial information of an assessee, thus allowing access to such information to a taxpayer for accurate filing of his return of income.
- The Finance Act 2022 has also introduced specific provisions for the taxation of virtual digital  assets  (VDA),  where  the  transfer  of VDA  is  to  be  taxed  at  the  rate  of  30%  with no deduction in respect of expenditure (other than the cost of acquisition) to be allowed. Moreover, loss from the transfer of virtual digital assets cannot be set off from any other income and cannot be carried forward to subsequent years. Further, the transfer of VDA is subject to TDS of 1% of the transaction value (whether in cash/ kind/ both). The gift of VDA would also be taxed in the hands of the recipient.
- Deduction  of  tax  at  source  on  benefit  or  perquisite  in  respect  of  business  or  profession has also been introduced in Finance Act 2022 to widen and deepen the tax base. A person providing any benefit or perquisite to a resident would deduct TDS of 10% of the value or aggregate of the value of such benefit or perquisite (whether in cash/kind/ both).
- Finance Act 2022 has provided that no set off of any loss shall be allowed against undisclosed income  detected  during  search  and  survey  operations  to  bring  certainty  and  increase deterrence among tax evaders.
- Vide  Finance Act  2022,  provisions  applicable  to  bonus  stripping  have  also  been  made applicable to securities. It has also been provided that the provisions on bonus stripping and dividend stripping shall also apply to units of an Infrastructure Investment Trust or a Real Estate Investment Trust, or units of Alternative Investment Funds.

## Tax incentives

- Finance Act 2022 has provided income tax relief to the amount received by a taxpayer for medical treatment from an employer or from any person for treatment of Covid-19 during FY 2019-2020 and subsequent years. Income-tax relief has also been provided to ex-gratia

payment received from the employer/ other person by family members of a person who has died on account of Covid-19 during FY 2019-2020 and subsequent years.

- Tax relief has also been widened to the persons with disability. The payment of annuity and lump sum amount from insurance scheme is to be allowed to differently abled dependent during the lifetime of parents/guardians, i.e., on parents/ guardian attaining the age of 60 years or more and where such contribution to the scheme has been discontinued.
- To bring parity between employees of State and Central government, the tax deduction limit on employer contribution has been increased from existing 10% to 14% of salary in NPS Tier-I Account for State Government employees as well. This would also help in enhancing social security benefits.
- To promote start-ups, the Income Tax Act of 1961 allows for a deduction of 100% of the profit and gains of eligible start-ups for three consecutive years out of ten years. However, due to Covid-19, there have been delays in setting up such eligible businesses. To lend a supporting hand to these start-ups, the period of incorporation of the eligible start-up has been extended to 31.03.2023 vide Finance Act 2022.
- To provide a level playing field between cooperative societies and companies, the alternate minimum tax rate  paid  by  cooperatives  has  been  reduced  from  18.5%  to  15%.  Further, surcharge on cooperative societies has been reduced from 12% to 7% for those having total income of more than ₹1 crore and up to ₹10 crore.
- For concessional tax regime to establish a globally competitive environment, the date of commencement of manufacturing or production of an article or thing for a newly established manufacturing entity for availing 15% concessional tax rate under section 115BAB of the Income-tax Act, 1961 has been extended from 31st March 2023 to 31st March 2024.
- Over the past few years, several tax concessions have been provided to units located in International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) under the Income-tax Act, 1961, to make it a global hub of the financial services sector. To further incentivise operations from IFSC, the following have been made exempt from tax subject to specified conditions vide Finance Act, 2022:
- i. Income of a non-resident from offshore derivative instruments
- ii. Income from over-the-counter derivatives issued by an offshore banking unit
- iii.  Income from royalty and interest on account of the lease of a ship
- iv.  Income received from portfolio management services in IFSC

## Annexe 3: Measures by CBIC undertaken during FY23

## Reform measures as regards customs:

- The Customs duty rate structure has been guided by a conscious policy of the government to incentivise domestic value addition under Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative, which  inter  alia  envisages  imposition  of  lower  duty  on  raw  materials  and  providing reasonable tariff support to goods being manufactured in India. The customs duty structure has  been  calibrated  to  incentivise  investment  in  key  areas  like  petroleum  exploration,

electronic manufacturing, etc. In accordance with this policy, the MFN rates of BCD have been increased in recent years on such items which are being manufactured in India or which domestic industry aspires to manufacture. Accordingly, during the last 6 years, about 4000 tariff lines (approximately 1/3rd of total tariff lines) have seen upward calibration of BCD. Such items include, metals, metal products, auto parts, footwear, fabrics, garments, specified chemicals, toys, certain machinery, medical equipment, a number of MSME items like bells, gongs, ceramic wares, table ware, utensils, hardware etc, consumer electronics and home appliances including mobile, TV, refrigerators, washing machine, AC, fans, heaters, hair dryers, shavers, toasters, ovens etc. At the same time, duties of inputs and raw materials have been rationalised.

- Phased Manufacturing Plan (PMP) in respect of significant products like mobile phones, other electronic goods like TVs, electric vehicles, batteries, solar panel etc- The BCD rates in respect of different stages of the value chain of these products are calibrated in a manner that encourages gradual deepening of domestic value addition. For example, in respect of mobile phones, initially the parts were placed under nil BCD while duty was imposed on mobiles.  Gradually,  duty  has  been  raised  on  parts  in  phased  manner  as  their  production began in India.
- India  stands  fully  compliant  with  all  the  commitments  under  WTO's  Trade  Facilitation Agreement. Compliance has been achieved well within the stipulated timeline of February 2022 and the same stands duly notified and acknowledged by the World Trade Organisation. The heartening results achieved can be evidenced from the significant improvements in the standings in the United Nation's Global Survey on Digital and Sustainable Trade Facilitation, wherein, India has witnessed a sustained improvement in the Trade Facilitation score to 90.32% in 2021 from 78.49% in 2019. India is the best performing country when compared with South and South West Asia (63.12%) region.
- With the objective to enhance the uniformity in the physical examination process of EXIM cargo  and  reduce  the  time  and  cost  involved  in  the  process,  CBIC  has  introduced  Risk Management based uniform cargo examination orders at all Customs locations across the country, vide Circular No. 16/2022-Customs dated 29th of August, 2022.
- Continuing with the trend to implement measures to facilitate taxpayers, CBIC has notified the Customs (Electronic Cash Ledger), Regulations, 2022 dated 30.03.2022 to enable the importer, exporter or any person liable to pay Customs duty, fees etc., to deposit an advance with the government instead of making transaction wise payment as was being done earlier. Such deposit can be utilised for payment of duties and other sums relating to Customs by seamlessly debiting the requisite amount from the ECL. Additionally, CBIC has launched an  Anonymised  Escalation  Mechanism  for  handling  the  grievances  related  to  delay  in clearances. In the above mechanism, CBIC's ICEGATE registered users can submit their grievance for delayed clearances under faceless assessment and escalate it anonymously to  the  concerned assessing as well as the higher officers at relevant FAG Port (Faceless Assessment Group). The Anonymized Escalation facility also  enables  users  to  track  the status of the grievances submitted by them till the final resolution.

- With an objective to utilise technology to optimise internal processes, CBIC has launched a  pilot  project  for  implementation  of  Electronic  Cargo  Tracking  System  (ECTS)  on 14.10.2021, based on blockchain technology for tracking movement of goods from the port to a warehouse at ICD Tughlakabad ensuring secured documentation &amp; GPS based tracking of containers.
- Indian  Customs  has  notified  IGCRS  Rules,  2022  vide  Notification  74/2022  dated  9th September, 2022 superseding the existing Customs (Import of Goods at Concessional Rate of Duty) Rules, 2017. These rules have come into effect from 10th September 2022. These rules have introduced significant changes for simplifying and automating the procedures for import of goods at concessional Rate of Duty in accordance with the larger goals of "Ease of doing business" by accommodating long standing demands from the trade such as inclusion of  job  work,  clearance  of  capital  goods  at  depreciated  value,  making  the  entire  process simple and online and doing away with any need for physical interface with officers.

## Changes in Customs Law and Procedure:

- As a trade facilitation measure, the validity of e-scrips issued under the Electronic Duty Credit Ledger Regulations, 2021, has been increased from one year to two years from the date of their generation. Further, the recovery provisions from the transferee holder of the e-scrips (issued under RoDTEP and RoSCTL schemes) and suspension of its credit account have also been omitted.
- In order to leverage the vast network of post offices across the country and enable MSME's (Micro Small and Medium Enterprises) to export to global markets using e-commerce or other regular channels, the CBIC in collaboration with the Department of Posts (Dop) has notified  the  Postal  Exports  (Electronic  Declaration  and  processing)  Regulations,  2022. Under the new system, an exporter need not visit a Foreign post Office (FPO) to file the Postal Bill of Export (PBE) and present export parcel. Rather, he is enabled to file the PBE online from his home/office and handover the export parcel to postal authorities at a nearby booking post office. Postal authorities shall arrange secure transport of export parcel from booking post office to an FPO, where customs clearance shall take place.
- Circular  No.8/2022-Customs  dated  17.5.2022  has  been  issued  to  enable  exports  from Bangladesh  to  India  by  rail  in  closed  containers,  with  clearance  at  hinterland  ICDs.  A transshipment module has also been developed in the Indian Customs EDI system to digitise the  procedure. This  would  decongest  the  border  trade  points  and  facilitate  Bangladesh's exports.
- Vide Circular No. 17/2022-Customs dated 9.9.2022, CBIC has enabled export of containerised cargo from any inland Container Depot (ICD) to Bangladesh using a combination of rail/ road route and riverine route. For instance, the containerised cargo after customs clearance at an ICD shall be transported to Kolkata/Haldia port by rail or road, from where it shall be loaded on a barge for export to Bangladesh using riverine route. Customs clearance shall take place at the ICD and only preventive checks are conducted at Kolkata/Haldia. This facility is expected to help reduce congestion of export cargo at land Customs Stations.

- With a view to leveraging the potential of inland Waterways for enhancing trade and transit, CBIC has allowed movement of containerised export goods of Bangladesh through India using a combination of riverine and rail routes. This facility, allowed Vide Circular No. 19/2022-Customs dated 14.9.2022, involves entry of containerised cargo on a barge/vessel from Bangladesh into India up to the sea port of Kolkata or Haldia using the riverine route. From the sea port of Kolkata or Haldia, the goods will travel by rail to the sea port of Nhava Sheva or Mundra for final export to third countries by sea route. The Circular lays down detailed procedure and documentation and provides for track and trace facility using ECTS (Electronics Cargo Tracking System). This arrangement is expected to save time and cost for the traders by providing an alternate and more efficient trade route.
- Vide Circular No. 09/2022-Customs dated 30.6.2022, CBIC has put in place a simplified regulatory  framework  for  e-commerce  exports  of  jewellery  via  international  Courier Terminals (ICTs). To accommodate the e-commerce business need, it incorporates a re-import process for return of jewellery. For this purpose, the Courier import and export (Electronic Declaration  and  Processing)  Regulations,  2010  have  been  amended  vide  Notification No. 57/2022-Customs (N.T) dated 30.6.2022. The simplified framework is applicable on e-commerce export of jewellery made of precious metals (whether or not studded or set with precious or semi-precious stones). This reform is aimed at supporting the Make-in-India brand in the international markets and enhancing the competitiveness of Indian jewellery exports leveraging the rapidly evolving global e-Market space.

## Changes in Excise Duty:
