# Progress on India's Climate Action

## Progress on india's Climate action

7.21  India's climate vision is integrally linked to its vision of development that foregrounds the goals of poverty eradication and guaranteeing basic well-being to all its citizens. Action on addressing climate action was initiated even before the Paris Agreement came into being. In 2008, India launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), establishing eight National Missions, covering several initiatives and a slew of measures in the area of solar, water, energy  efficiency,  forests,  sustainable  habitat,  sustainable  agriculture,  sustaining  Himalayan ecosystem, capacity building and research and development (R&amp;D).

7.22  National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC), a central sector scheme, was initiated in 2015-16 to support adaptation activities in the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India that are vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. NAFCC is implemented in project mode, and to date, 30 projects have been sanctioned in 27 States and UTs with a total project cost of ₹847.5 crore. NAFCC supports adaptation action, in, inter alia, agriculture, water, forestry, livestock, and restoring ecosystems. At present (November 2022), 28 projects are under implementation.

7.23  Demonstrating higher ambition in its climate action, the Government of India submitted its updated NDC on August 26, 2022. The new NDC with enhanced targets translates the vision of the Hon'ble PM expressed through the ' Panchamrit' at the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP 26) in Glasgow in November 2021. The vision mentions of sustainable lifestyles and climate justice to protect the poor and vulnerable from the adverse impacts of climate change. Aligning with this vision, the share of non-fossil fuel-based capacity in overall capacity has risen rapidly over time.  Including the large hydro, the share of non-fossil sources in total installed electricity capacity is estimated to be about 40.4 per cent (on 31.09.2022) compared to 27.3 per cent in 2014-15. This period has seen a sizeable enhancement in the share of installed electricity capacity in solar and wind energy from 8.9 per cent in 2014-15 to 25.1 per cent in 2022-23 (April-Sept).

## Box vii.1: india's updated nationally determined Contribution (ndC)

India submitted its first NDC to UNFCCC in October 2015. This was updated in August 2022. The 2015 NDC comprised eight goals, three of which were quantitative targets to be achieved up to 2030. The three targets included cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources to reach 40 per cent, reduction in the emissions intensity of GDP by 33 to 35 per cent compared to 2005 levels, and creation of additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO 2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover.

Article 4 of the Paris Agreement provides that each Party shall communicate or update its NDC every five years. Therefore, in accordance with the aforesaid provision of the Paris Agreement, India submitted the following updates to its first NDC of 2015.

1. T o  put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions and values of conservation and moderation, including through a mass movement for 'LIFE''Lifestyle for Environment' as a key to combating climate change.
2. T o adopt a climate-friendly and cleaner path than the one followed hitherto by others at the corresponding level of economic development.
3. T o reduce the Emissions Intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent by 2030, from the 2005 level.
4. T o  achieve  about  50  per  cent  cumulative  electric  power  installed  capacity  from  non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, with the help of the transfer of technology and low-cost international finance, including from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).

5. T o  create  an  additional  carbon  sink  of  2.5  to  3  billion  tonnes  of  CO 2 equivalent  through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.
6. T o better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in development programmes in sectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, the Himalayan region, coastal regions, and health and disaster management.
7. T o mobilise domestic and new &amp; additional funds from developed countries to implement the above mitigation and adaptation actions in view of the resource required and the resource gap.
8. T o build capacities and create a domestic framework and international architecture for quick diffusion of cutting-edge climate technology in India and for joint collaborative R&amp;D for such future technologies.

## Status of Forest and tree Cover

7.24  One of the three quantifiable targets of India's NDC is to achieve an additional carbon sink of 2.5 billion to 3.0 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The forest and tree cover in India has shown a gradual and steady trend of increase in the last one and a half decades.

7.25  The country ranks third globally with respect to the net gain in average annual forest area between 2010 and 2020. This gain is mainly attributed to the robust framework and policies of the National and State Governments that have promoted and safeguarded forests. Schemes like the Green India Mission (GIM), Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), National Afforestation Programme (NAP), Green Highway Policy - 2015, Policy for enhancement of Urban Greens, National Agro-forestry Policy, and Sub-Mission on Agro-forestry (SMAF), etc. are among the most important ones.

## Carbon Stock in india's Forest and tree Cover

7.26  A robust forest ecosystem is a vital sink of carbon.  Forest Survey of India (FSI) assessed the carbon stock (which is the amount of carbon sequestrated from the atmosphere and stored in biomass, deadwood, soil, and litter in the forest) in India's forests for the first time in 2004 and then biennially since 2011. The Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR) estimates the carbon stock of forests to be about 7,204 million tonnes in 2019 7 , which is an increase of 79.4 million tonnes of carbon stock as compared to the estimates of the previous assessment for 2017. This translates into carbon emissions sequestrated through forest and tree cover to be 30.1 billion tonnes of CO 2 equivalent.

7.27  Among the Indian States, Arunachal Pradesh has the maximum carbon stock in forests (1023.84 million tonnes), followed by Madhya Pradesh (609.25 million tonnes). The per-hectare forest carbon stock among different States/UTs indicates that Jammu &amp; Kashmir is contributing the maximum per-hectare carbon stock of 173.41 tonnes, followed by Himachal Pradesh (167.0 tonnes), Sikkim (166.2 tonnes) and Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands (162.9 tonnes).

## Preservation of ecosystems: a Critical adaptation action

7.28  Ecosystems  play  an  important  role  in  carbon  storage,  protect  the  coastal  areas,  and enhance water quality besides other services, such as cultural, spiritual or tourist attractions. Wetlands are natural buffers against floods, droughts, and tropical cyclones. Wetlands can act as sponges, storing peak rainfall and releasing water gradually during the lean season. The floods in Kashmir Valley in September 2014 and Chennai city in December 2015 are reminders of the ways wetland destruction can make lives vulnerable. The Ramsar Convention, signed on February 2, 1971, is one of the oldest inter-governmental accords signed by member countries to  preserve  the  ecological  character  of  their  wetlands  of  international  importance.  Wetlands declared as Ramsar sites are protected. India has 75 Ramsar sites covering an area of 13.3 lakh ha, and 49 of these have been added in the last 8 years.

7.29  Mangroves and coastal wetlands form the first line of defence for coastal communities against increased storm surges, flooding, and hurricanes. As per a recent study, certain mangrove species in Chilika and Sundarbans along the east coast and Dwarka and Porbandar along the west coast of India are likely to reduce and shift landward by 2070 due to a decline in suitable habitats in response to precipitation and sea level changes. 8

7.30  The  Government  has  taken  both  regulatory  and  promotional  measures  to  protect  and conserve  mangroves.  The  National  Coastal  Mission  Programme  on  'Conservation  and Management of Mangroves and Coral Reefs' is being implemented. Regulatory measures are implemented through Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification (2019) under the Environment

## river Conservation and rejuvenation

7.31  The Government is working on mapping and converging the 5Ps' - People, Policy, Plan, Programme and Project. It has been supplementing the efforts of the States/Union Territories (UTs) by providing financial and technical assistance for the abatement of pollution in identified polluted stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for  River  Ganga  and  its  tributaries,  and  the  Centrally  Sponsored  Scheme  of  National  River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers.

7.32  In  addition,  the  government  has  recently  released  Detailed  Project  Reports  (DPR)  for the rejuvenation of 13 major rivers prepared by the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education  (ICFRE),  Dehradun  in  consultation  with  the  State  Forest  Departments  and  other line  Departments.  Works  proposed  under  these  DPRs  include  afforestation  on  riverbanks leading to increased green cover, measures to contain soil erosion, recharge the groundwater table,  sequester  carbon  dioxide,  catchment  area  treatment,  ecological  restoration,  moisture conservation, livelihood improvement &amp; income generation, etc.

## approach to transition to renewable energy Sources

7.33  While the target was to achieve 40 per cent of the installed electric capacity from nonfossil fuel sources by 2030 in the initial NDC submitted in 2015, the target has already been achieved. India is now striving to achieve the target of 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, in line with updated NDCs.

7.34  India is progressively becoming a favoured destination for investment in renewables. As per the Renewables 2022 Global Status Report, during the period 2014 -2021, total investment in  renewables  stood  at  US$  78.1  billion  in  India.  Investment  in  renewable  energy  has  been close to or higher than US$ 10 billion per year since 2016, except for a dip in 2020 likely due to various Covid-19 restrictions.

7.35  The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has projected the optimal generation capacity mix to meet the peak electricity demand and electrical energy requirement for 2029-30. The estimate builds in improved efficiency and minimises the total system cost subject to various technical/financial constraints. The likely installed capacity by the end of 2029-30 is expected to be more than 800 GW of which non-fossil fuel would be more than 500 GW.

7.36  Moreover,  the  CEA  has  also  estimated  that  the  average  emission  rate  will  decline  by around 29 per cent by 2029-30 compared to 2014-15.

## green hydrogen-a critical source of alternate energy

7.37  From  the  emerging  global  momentum  on  green  hydrogen,  India  can  situate  this decarbonisation opportunity not just within the context of a low-carbon economy but also as an enabler of energy security and economic development for the nation. It will be crucial for achieving  decarbonisation  of  harder-to-abate  sectors  such  as  fertilisers,  refining,  methanol,

maritime shipping, iron &amp; steel and long-haul transport. Green hydrogen is also an important element of India's Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS).

7.38  With a vision to make India an energy-independent nation, and to de-carbonise critical sectors, the Government approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission on January 4, 2023 with an initial outlay of ₹19,744 crore. The Mission will facilitate demand creation, production, utilisation and export of Green Hydrogen and mobilisation of over ₹8 lakh crore of investment by 2030.

7.39  A report by NITI Aayog 9 in June 2022 shows that in the case of India, renewable tariffs have fallen in recent years, and electrolyser costs are expected to fall in the future.  A recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (2020) 10 suggests that the cost of electrolysers is crucial for making green hydrogen economically viable. The report also underscores the importance of innovation in electrolyser technology and the rapid increase in its scale of production as the main factors that would drive down the cost of electrolysers and green hydrogen.

7.40  NITI's report estimates that the cumulative value of the green hydrogen market in India will be US$ 8 billion by 2030 and US$ 340 billion by 2050. The electrolyser market will be approximately US$ 5 billion by 2030 and US$ 31 billion by 2050. In addition, the adoption of green hydrogen will also result in 3.6 Giga tonnes of cumulative CO 2 emission reduction by 2050. This will also generate enormous energy import savings, ensure stability in industry input prices, and strengthen foreign exchange reserves in the long run.

7.41  However, all this is based on the assumption that access to critical minerals essential for renewable energy at a reasonable cost will continue-an assumption that could be an effective constraint  in  the  face  of  the  concentration  of  these  minerals  in  certain  geographies  with  a monopoly in access to some countries. 12

## Box vii.2: Critical minerals-Key to green transition

The shift  to  a  clean  energy  system  is  set  to  drive  a  huge  increase  in  the  requirements  for  critical minerals. This is because an energy system powered by clean energy technologies differs profoundly from one fuelled by traditional hydrocarbon resources. Cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, and rare earth elements (REEs) are critical for producing electric vehicles and batteries and harnessing solar power and wind energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) plants, wind farms and electric vehicles (EVs) generally require more minerals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts. A typical electric car requires six times the mineral inputs of a conventional car, and an onshore wind plant requires nine times more mineral resources than a gas-fired plant 12 .

The types of mineral resources used vary by technology. Lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite are crucial to battery performance, longevity and energy density. REEs are essential for permanent magnets that are vital for wind turbines and EV motors. Electricity networks need a huge amount of copper and aluminium, with copper being a cornerstone for all electricity-related technologies.

While the demand for critical minerals is set to increase because of the global preference and emphasis towards renewable energy, the global supply chain of the critical minerals is highly concentrated and unevenly distributed. The skewed distribution of the resource poses a supply risk in the face of its enhanced demand.

11 LCOH refers to the cost of hydrogen production per unit of hydrogen includind capital and operational costs.

A carefully crafted multi-dimensional mineral policy would reduce our dependence and address the problems for the future. The country has resources of nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, and heavy REEs, but further exploration would be needed to evaluate the quantities of their reserves. There is a need to create strategic mineral reserves along the lines of strategic petroleum reserves to ensure a continuous supply of minerals. Also, policies should consider investing in internal research including technological innovation for mineral exploration and processing and the development of Recycling, Reusing, and Repurposing (R3) technologies.

In order to ensure the mineral security of the nation and to attain self-reliance in the area of critical and strategic minerals, the Ministry of Mines has created a Joint Venture company, namely Khanij Bidesh India Ltd (KABIL), with participating interests of NALCO, HCL and MECL. KABIL is mandated to identify and acquire overseas mineral assets of critical and strategic nature, such as Lithium, Cobalt etc. Further, the Ministry of Mines, Government of India and the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources (DISER), Government of Australia, signed an MoU on June 3, 2020 for cooperation in the field of mining and processing of critical and strategic minerals.  Further, KABIL has also signed a detailed MoU with a collaborative framework with the Critical Minerals Facilitation Office under the DISER on March 10, 2022 to identify lithium and cobalt mineral assets for final joint investment decisions and acquisition of the assets in Australia catering to the critical and strategic ecosystem of both the countries.

## long-term low emissions development Strategy (lt-ledS)

7.42  India  submitted  its  Long-Term  Low  Carbon  Development  Strategy  (LT-LEDS)  on November 14, 2022, at COP 27. The salient features of LT-LEDS are:

- Focus on the rational utilisation of national resources with due regard to energy security. The transitions from fossil fuels will be undertaken in a just, smooth, sustainable and allinclusive manner.
- Encompasses the objectives of the National Hydrogen Policy. The rapid expansion of green hydrogen production, increasing electrolyser manufacturing capacity in the country, and a

three-fold increase in nuclear capacity by 2032 are some of the other milestones that are envisaged alongside the overall development of the power sector.

- Increased use of biofuels, especially ethanol blending in petrol. The drive to increase electric vehicle penetration, and the increased use of green hydrogen fuel are expected to drive the low carbon development of the transport sector. India aspires to maximise the use of electric vehicles, ethanol blending to reach 20 per cent by the Ethanol Supply Year 2025-26, and a strong modal shift to public transport for passengers and freight.
- Climate-resilient  urban  development  will  be  driven  by  smart  city  initiatives,  integrated planning  of  cities  for  mainstreaming  adaptation  and  enhancing  energy  and  resource efficiency, effective green building codes and developments in innovative solid and liquid waste management.
- India's  industrial  sector  will  continue  on  a  strong  growth  path,  with  the  vision  of  ' Aatmanirbhar Bharat' and ' Make in India' .

7.43  LT-LEDS has been prepared in the framework of India's right to an equitable and fair share of the global carbon budget and is the practical implementation of India's call for 'climate justice.' This is essential to ensure that there are no constraints on realising India's vision of rapid growth and economic transformation while protecting the environment. The LT-LEDS is driven by the vision of LiFE, Lifestyle for the Environment that calls for a worldwide paradigm shift from mindless and destructive consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation. Here, the transition to low carbon development pathway will entail costs. In addition, the provision for climate finance by developed countries will play a very significant role and, therefore, needs to be considerably enhanced in the form of grants and concessional loans.
