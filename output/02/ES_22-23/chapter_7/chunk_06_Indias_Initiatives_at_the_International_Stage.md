## international Solar alliance (iSa)

7.62  The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation working to create a global market system to tap the benefits of solar power and promote clean energy applications. ISA's mission is to unlock US$ 1 trillion of investments in solar by 2030 while reducing the cost of the technology and its financing. With the signing and ratification of the ISA Framework Agreement by 15 countries on 6 December 2017, ISA became the first international intergovernmental organisation to be headquartered in India.  ISA is partnering with multilateral development banks (MDBs), development financial institutions (DFIs), private and public sector organisations, civil society, and other international institutions to deploy costeffective and transformational solutions through solar energy, especially in the least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

7.63  The ISA has expanded its coverage to all its 110 member countries. It assists them with the adoption of solar energy with the view to improving energy access, ensuring energy security and facilitating the energy transition. Through the programmatic support offered by ISA, a pipeline of 9.5 GW of solar energy capacity has been identified in its member countries, including largescale  solar  parks  in  multiple  developing  countries.  In  its  member  countries,  with  a  grant  of US$ 50,000, ISA is  assisting  in  setting  up  solar  energy  demonstration  projects.  Three  such demonstration projects were inaugurated at the Fifth Assembly of ISA.

## Coalition for disaster resilient infrastructure

7.64  The CDRI was launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India during the United Nations Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019 in New York. It is a global partnership of National Governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks and financing mechanisms, the private sector, and academic and knowledge institutions. It aims to promote the resilience of infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks, thereby ensuring sustainable development.

7.65  As  on  29  June  2022,  thirty-one  Countries,  six  International  Organisations  and  two private sector organisations have joined as members of CDRI.  CDRI has been expanding its membership  consistently  by  attracting  a  wide  variety  of  economically  advanced  countries, developing countries, and countries that are most vulnerable to climate change and disasters. Over a period, a network of organisations/stakeholders will be developed to advance disasterresilient infrastructure not only in India but in other partner countries as well.

## leadership group for industry transition (leadit)

7.66  The LeadIT gathers countries and companies that are committed to action to achieve the Paris Agreement. It was launched by the governments of Sweden and India at the UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019 and is supported by the World Economic Forum. LeadIT members subscribe to the notion that energy-intensive industries can and must progress on lowcarbon pathways, aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.

7.67  During COP 27, LeadIT members adopted a joint statement wherein members collectively agreed to:

- (i) promote value chain partnerships and material circularity;
- (ii) invest  and  cooperate  on  the  planning  and  implementation  of  infrastructure  to  support energy and industry transitions;
- (iii) give multilateral development banks and multilateral climate funds mandates to de-risk investments in the transition of heavy industries in emerging and developing countries;
- (iv) formulate  roadmaps  for  heavy  industry  sectors  that  include  regulatory  frameworks, incentives,  and  long-term  strategies,  to  facilitate  transition  finance  and  attract  private investments.
