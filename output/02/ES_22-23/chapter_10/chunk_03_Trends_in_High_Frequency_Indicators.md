## Services PMi

10.4  India's  services  sector  activity,  gauged  by  PMI  Services,  which  remained  in  the contractionary zone for several months during 2020 and 2021 on account of the restrictions imposed to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic, recovered swiftly with the waning of the Omicron variant at the beginning of 2022. However, PMI services again witnessed a setback with the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The indicator moderated from May to September 2022 as economic uncertainty resulted in weaker sales growth and inflationary pressures restricting the upturn in business activity. Further, price pressures and unfavourable weather also dampened domestic demand. However, following an overall easing of retail inflation leading to retreating price pressures of inputs and raw materials, PMI services witnessed an uptick and expanded to 58.5 in December 2022.

## Bank credit

10.5  Bank credit to the services sector has witnessed significant growth since October 2021 with the improvement in vaccination coverage and recovery in the services sector. The credit to services sector saw a YoY growth of 21.3 per cent in November 2022, the second highest in 46 months, compared to a 3.3 per cent growth in November 2021. Within the services sector, credit to wholesale and retail trade increased by 10.2 per cent and 21.9 per cent in November 2022, respectively, reflecting the strength of the underlying economic activity. Credit to NBFCs grew by 32.9 per cent as NBFCs shifted to bank borrowings because of high bond yields. Uncertain growth prospects in the global markets and uneven credit allocation to the transport sector led to a decline in credit to the shipping and aviation sector by 7.9 per cent and 8.7 per cent respectively in November 2022.

## Services trade

10.6  World services trade volume finally surpassed its pre-pandemic peak in the second quarter of 2022 and was expected to remain strong in the third quarter, buoyed by spending on travel, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) services, and financial services. However, WTO's Services Trade Barometer Index reading fell to 98.3 for October 2022 (slightly below its baseline value of 100), well below the previous reading of 105.5 in June 2022 indicating that YoY growth in real commercial services began moderating in the third quarter of 2022 and may slow further in the fourth as well as into the first quarter of 2023 due to declining growth prospects in major service industry economies. Financial and ICT Services have been so far most resilient to the slowing global economy, whereas, construction services and container shipping fell into contraction territory.

10.7  Insofar as India is concerned, some headwinds may be observed in the coming months because of the slowing growth in some of India's major trading partners. On the contrary, India's services exports may improve as runaway inflation in advanced economies drives up wages and makes local sourcing expensive, opening up avenues for outsourcing to low-wage countries, including India. India is a significant player in services trade, being among the top ten services

exporter countries in 2021, having increased its share in world commercial services exports from 3 per cent in 2015 to 4 per cent in 2021. A further increase in the share is likely, with the services exports registering growth of 27.7 per cent during April-December 2022 as compared to 20.4 per cent in the corresponding period last year.

10.8  Among services exports, software exports have remained relatively resilient during the Covid-19 pandemic as well as amid current geopolitical uncertainties, driven by higher demand for digital support, cloud services, and infrastructure modernisation catering to new challenges. Transport and travel exports have been the most impacted sub-components of the services exports in FY21 and FY22, which contracted due to the imposition of restrictions on international travel and tourism during the Covid-19 pandemic. If there is a meaningful economic slowdown in advanced nations, tourism and travel earnings in FY24 may be on the lower side.

## foreign Direct investment (fDi) in Services

10.9  The  World  Investment  Report  2022  of  UNCTAD  places  India  as  the  seventh  largest recipient of FDI in the top 20 host countries in 2021. In FY22 India received the highest-ever FDI inflows of US$ 84.8 billion including US$ 7.1 billion FDI equity inflows in the services sector. To facilitate investment, various measures have been undertaken by the Government, such as the launch of the National Single-Window system, a one-stop solution for approvals and clearances needed by investors, entrepreneurs, and businesses. To ensure the liberalisation of investment in various industries, the Government has permitted 100 per cent foreign participation in telecommunication services, including all services and infrastructure providers, through the Automatic Route. The FDI ceiling in insurance companies was also raised from 49 to 74 per cent, under Automatic Route. Further, Government has allowed 20 per cent foreign investment in Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) under the automatic route.

## Box X.1: initiatives in the insurance Sector by the insurance regulatory and Development Authority of india (irDAi) in fY23 1

The Indian Insurance sector is at an inflexion point. India will be one of the main drivers of global insurance industry growth over the next decade. Indian Insurance Market is the 10th largest in the world and is poised to become the 6th largest by 2032, ahead of Germany, Canada, Italy, and South Korea 2 .  The insurance regulator, IRDAI, has taken up the mission of universal insurance, which is expected to lead to a significant increase in insurance penetration such that, when India celebrates 100 years of its independence in 2047, every Indian has appropriate life, health, and property insurance cover and every enterprise is supported by appropriate insurance solutions. Towards this objective, the insurance regulator has taken various steps to promote healthy growth of the insurance industry, rationalise the regulatory framework, and reduce the compliance burden of regulated entities.

In  line  with  the  Government  of  India's  vision  towards  Financial  Inclusion  and  a  strong  emphasis on  accelerating  reforms,  IRDAI,  during  FY23,  has  implemented  the  following  measures  to increase accessibility, innovation, competition, distribution efficiency, and choice availability while mainstreaming technology and moving towards principle-based regime: -

- i.    easy entry into the insurance sector: A Single Window NOC Portal (www.noc.irdai.gov.in) was launched to facilitate the incorporation of an insurer by making the NOC available in a hassle-free and timely manner.
- ii.    Quick launch of insurance Products: Insurers can now launch all Health &amp; General Insurance products, as well as the majority of Life Insurance products, without seeking prior approval from IRDAI, thereby reducing the time taken to launch a new product in the market from a few months to a few days.
- iii.    ease of doing business: IRDAI has taken several actions to lessen the burden of compliance. In this direction, so far, 70 returns have been rationalised, and about 85 circulars have been repealed while dispensing with the prior approval requirements in certain identified areas.
- iv.    Providing further impetus to the industry: Given that the sector has reached a level of maturity that may not necessitate closer supervision, more flexibility to the regulated entities in the areas of operational and business decisions is being considered.
- v.    Addressing dynamic needs of the industry: IRDAI has facilitated various measures as per the evolving needs of the sector, such as Tech-based add-ons (General insurers have been permitted to introduce tech-enabled concepts for Motor Insurance such as  Pay as You Drive, Pay How You Drive, etc.), expansion in the scope of the cashless facility in health insurance, Innovative products in Fire Insurance, Ease of living for Senior Citizen.
