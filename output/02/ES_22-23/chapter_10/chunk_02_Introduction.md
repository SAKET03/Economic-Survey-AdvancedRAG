10.1  The Covid-19 pandemic hurt most sectors of the economy, with the effect particularly profound for contact-intensive services sectors like tourism, retail trade, hotel, entertainment, and recreation. On the other hand, non-contact services such as information, communication, financial, professional, and business services remained resilient. However, the services sector witnessed a swift rebound in FY22, growing Year-on-Year (YoY) at 8.4 per cent compared to a contraction of 7.8 per cent in the previous financial year. The improvement was driven by growth in the 'Trade, Hotel, Transport, Storage, Communication and Services related to broadcasting' sub-sector,  which  bore  the  maximum  burden  of  the  pandemic.  The  growth  momentum  has continued in FY23 as well. As per the First Advance Estimates, Gross Value Added (GVA) in the services sector is estimated to grow at 9.1 per cent in FY23, driven by 13.7 per cent growth in contact-intensive services sector.

10.2  Even on a sequential basis, the rebound continued in Q2 of FY23, with the services sector recording 8.7 per cent sequential growth. The contact-intensive services sub-sector completely recovered the pre-pandemic level and registered sequential growth of 16 per cent, driven by the release of pent-up demand, ease of mobility restriction, and near-universal vaccination coverage. Going forward, the buoyant recovery of the contact-intensive services sector, accompanied by the robust performance of HFIs, suggests that the sector is likely to be the growth driver in the next fiscal.
