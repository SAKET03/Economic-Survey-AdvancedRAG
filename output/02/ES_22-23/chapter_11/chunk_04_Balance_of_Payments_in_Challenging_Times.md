## Balance of payments in challenging times

## current account Balance

11.35  India's external sector has been facing considerable global headwinds reflecting the geopolitical developments as detailed in the Introduction section above. India's current account balance (CAB) recorded a deficit of US$ 36.4 billion (4.4 per cent of GDP) in Q2FY23 in contrast to a deficit of US$ 9.7 billion (1.3 per cent of GDP) during the corresponding period of the previous year. The widening of the current account deficit (CAD) in the second quarter of FY23 was mainly on account of a higher merchandise trade deficit of US$ 83.5 billion and an increase in net investment income outgo. For the period April- September 2022 (H1FY23), India recorded a CAD of 3.3 per cent of GDP on the back of an increase in the merchandise trade deficit,  as  compared with 0.2 per cent in H1FY22. However, a comparison with the position  of  the  CAB  for  selected  countries  shows  that  India's  CAD  is  modest  and  within manageable limits.

## Invisibles

11.36  Net services receipts increased from US$ 51.4 billion in H1FY22 to US$ 65.5 billion in H1FY23, primarily on account of robust computer and business services receipts. Similarly, the net private transfer receipts, mainly representing remittances by Indians employed overseas, was US$ 48.0 billion in H1 FY23 against their level of US$ 38.4 billion during the same period a year ago. A sharp rise in crude oil prices and the deprecation of the INR seem to have boosted remittance flows into India. Net services exports and remittances contributed to the surplus on the invisible account, which cushioned the merchandise trade deficit.

11.37    Remittances  are  the  second  largest  major  source  of  external  financing  after  service export, which contribute to narrowing the CAD and has always been a stable constituent of the BoP. India has the largest emigrant population and is the top remittance recipient country with remittances anticipated to reach a milestone of US$100 billion in 2022 according to the World

Bank. 17 Remittances  have  benefitted  from  a  gradual  structural  shift  in  Indian  migrants'  key destinations from largely low-skilled, informally employment in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries to a dominant share of high-skilled jobs in high-income countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and East Asia (Singapore, Japan, Australia, New Zealand). 18

## capital account Balance

11.38  Foreign investment, consisting of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and foreign portfolio investment (FPI), is the largest component of the capital account. On a BoP basis, the net capital inflows declined to US$ 29.0 billion in H1FY23 from US$ 65.0 billion 19  in H1FY22 primarily driven by the FPI outflow of US$ 14.6 billion in Q1FY23. Net FDI inflows at US$ 20.0 billion in H1FY23 were comparable with US$ 20.3 billion in H1FY22.

11.39  During April-September 2022, gross FDI inflows were US$ 39.3 billion as compared to US$ 42.5 billion a year ago. Computer Software and Hardware attracted the highest share of FDI equity inflow (23.4 per cent) followed by Services (15.4 per cent) and Trading (12.2 per

11.40  Repercussions of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and aggressive monetary policy tightening by the US Fed escalated global financial market volatility leading to net outflow by FPIs in Q1FY23. However, FPI flows turned positive in Q2FY23. Overall, FPIs recorded a net outflow of US$ 2.5 billion during April-December 2022 as against an outflow of US$ 0.6 billion a year ago.

11.41  Among other forms of capital flows, in H1FY23, banking capital reported higher net inflows of US$ 10.6 billion against US$ 4.4 billion during the same period of FY22.  As global liquidity conditions tightened, demand for short-term trade credit rose during H1FY23, resulting in higher net short-term credit receipts of US$ 10.1 billion. Furthermore, with more repayments in comparison to fresh disbursals, external commercial borrowings (ECBs) to India recorded net outflows of US$ 3.0 billion in H1FY23 as against net inflows of US$ 5.0 billion a year ago.

## Balance of payments and foreign Exchange reserves

11.42  Overall, the adverse global economic situation placed India's BoP under pressure in 2022. While the impact of a sharp rise in oil prices was discernible in the widening of the CAD, policy tightening by the US Fed and the strengthening of the US dollar led to FPI outflows. As a result, as the net financial inflows fell short of the CAD, there was a depletion of foreign exchange reserves on a BoP basis to the tune of US$ 25.8 billion in H1FY23 in contrast to an accretion of US$ 63.1 billion in H1FY22.  But huge valuation losses (US$ 48.9 billion) contributed to the net depletion of US$ 74.6 billion of reserves in nominal terms during the period.

11.43  India's foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 532.7 billion as of end-September 2022, covering  8.8  months  of  imports.  The  reserves  augmented  to  US$  562.7  billion  as  of  endDecember 2022 covering 9.3 months of imports. As of end-November 2022, India was the sixth largest foreign exchange reserves holder in the world according to data compiled by the IMF. As seen from the graph, the import coverage of foreign currency reserves has declined since the pre-pandemic levels in most emerging market economies; however, that of India has increased from 95% in Q4 2019 to 96.5% in Q3 2022. Box XI.2 discusses some aspects of the literature on what constitutes adequate forex reserves for a country.

## Box xI.2: adequacy of foreign exchange reserves

How to assess what constituted an adequate level of Foreign Exchange Reserves (FER)? Are there some international benchmarks or thumb rules which can serve as a guide? What are the factors which a country should consider while determining its own threshold of 'adequacy'? How best to ensure the liquidity of such reserves as against mere availability? This box attempts to answer these questions by drawing from the relevant literature and present an academic perspective.

FER is required for various purposes, such as to maintain the exchange rate within a certain range, or to maintain a certain level of exchange rate if the country follows a fixed exchange rate system; maintain liquidity and allow time to absorb shocks in situations where access to borrowing is curtailed or very costly. The optimal level of reserves empowers the government to maximise the welfare of the representative consumer, given the constraint of sudden stops in terms of debt rollover crisis. The drivers behind the accumulation of reserves have evolved over the years: initially for precautionary purposes until the early 2000s, followed by goals of monetary and exchange rate policies (Arslan Yavuz, et al 2019). Accordingly, the FERs of several countries have witnessed a rising trend, more so since the global financial crisis of 2008.

This  brings  in  the  debate  on  adequacy  of  reserves.  Conventionally,  there  are  three  measures  of adequacy of reserves, viz. ratios of reserves to imports, to monetary aggregates, and measures of external debt (IMF, 2000). According to the traditional approach to determining the adequacy of reserves, the simple rule of thumb is three months of imports or full cover of short-term debt. As regards the former, there is little empirical support for whether the adequate coverage should be three months, as opposed to say two or six (IMF, 2011). The latter derives from the Guidotti-GreenspanIMF rule which states that a country's reserves should equal short-term external debt (one-year or less maturity), suggesting a ratio of reserves-to-short term debt of one. The rationale is that countries

should have enough reserves to cope with the withdrawal of short-term foreign capital. Then there are also money-based indicators of reserves which provide a measure of the potential for residentbased capital flight from the currency. The indicators used are the ratio of reserves to broad money or the ratio of reserves to base money which help in assessing reserve adequacy under fixed exchange rate regimes. Each of these indicators may, in themselves, not be adequate to assess the requirements of FERs for an economy and different measures may typically be used for different purposes.

The IMF (SM/00/65, 3/23/2000), noted the importance of short-term debt as a source of risk but cautioned against excessive reliance on a single indicator and pointed to the need to consider various potential sources of short-term demand for reserves. Further, IMF (SM/01/311, 10/16/2001) has noted the need to complement indicator-based analyses with stress-testing of the BoP . In addition, there are customised risk-based broader-based metrics tailor-made to capture sources of risk emanating from external liabilities (debt and equity) as well as current account variables (export earnings) and some measure of potential capital flight (broad money) (IMF, 2011).   Adequacy should be considered against total resources available to meet shocks, a broader concept than the BoP-determined definition of reserve assets.

While reserves are imperative in both preventing crises situations and mitigating their impact, there is a cost involved in holding them and they are subject to diminishing returns. The costs borne by an economy for holding FER include the opportunity cost, in terms of the difference between domestic and foreign borrowing rates and loss due to the value reduction in the denominated FER. Rodrik (2006) examines the social cost of FERs and finds that the income loss to most developing countries amounts to close to one per cent of GDP.

Fukuda and Kon (2010) evaluate the macroeconomic impact of reserve accumulation and find evidence that an increase in FERs raises external debt outstanding but shortens debt maturity. Further, in the longrun, consumption declines, and exports, are promoted by encouraging a switch from the non-tradable sector to the tradable sector through higher investment and growth. Further, FERs could be inflationary through exchange rate effects (Lin, et al 2009) and moral hazard and incentive effects (Chitu, 2016).

Therefore, an economy should organise its reserves FER, in terms of the optimal size and currency composition,  considering  the  benefits,  costs,  and  impacts  of  holding  them.  Co-movement  of  the domestic currency with key currencies and the currency invoicing of trade (Ito, 2019); trade flows (trade invoicing), financial flows (share of debt service payments in a currency), and currency pegs (Eichengreen, 2000) are the dominant factors influencing the currency composition of FERs.  Further, drawing from the field of finance, the Value at Risk (VaR) approach has also been employed to arrive at the optimal foreign exchange portfolio (Hung et al. (2008).

As briefly reviewed above, the rich literature on reserve adequacy presents very useful background information and empirical analysis for policy choices and likely outcomes.
