# International Investment Position: A Reflection of India's Financial Soundness

## International Investment position: a reflection of India's financial Soundness

11.48  The international investment position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value and composition of (a) financial assets of residents of an economy that are claims on non-residents and gold bullion held as reserve assets, and (b) liabilities of residents of an economy to non-residents. The difference between an economy's external financial assets and liabilities is the economy's net IIP, which may be positive or negative. 23 The Net IIP position determines whether a country is a net creditor or debtor nation by measuring the difference in its external assets and liabilities. These statistics serve as an indicator of a country's financial condition and soundness. The Net IIP, along with the BoP transactions, reflects the domestic economy's set of international accounts.

11.49  For India, as of end-September 2022, Indian residents' overseas financial assets at US$ 847.5 billion were lower by US$ 73.0 billion or 7.9 per cent compared to the level as of endMarch 2022, mainly due to the reduction in reserve assets even as trade credit and overseas direct  investment  recorded  an  increase.  Reserve  assets  at  US$  532.7  billion,  accounting  for around 62.9 per cent of India's international financial assets fell by 12.3 per cent over the same period.

11.50  International liabilities at US$ 1,237.1 billion as of end-September 2022 were lower by US$ 41.6 billion (3.2 per cent) as compared to the level as of end-March 2022. This fall was attributed primarily to direct investment (net) outflows, while variations in the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis other currencies also had an impact on the change in liabilities when valued in US$ terms. The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities was 50 per cent as of endSeptember 2022.

11.51  Thus, the net claims of non-residents on India, valued at US$ 389.6 billion as of endSeptember 2022, increased by US$ 31.4 billion over the level as of end-March 2022. India's international financial assets covered 68.5 per cent of international financial liabilities as of endSeptember 2022.
