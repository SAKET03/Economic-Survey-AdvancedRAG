## Exchange rates Moving in tandem with Global developments

11.44  The exchange rate of the Indian Rupee is market-determined as the RBI's intervention in the foreign exchange market is mainly to contain instances of excessive volatility. On a financial year basis, i.e., from  April to December 2022, the INR has depreciated against US$ by 8.3 per cent. 20 Over the same period, the US dollar has appreciated by 4.4 per cent in terms of the US dollar index. 21 This holds even on a calendar year basis, i.e., from January to December 2022, the INR has depreciated by 10.8 per cent whereas the US dollar has appreciated by 6.4 per cent. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate  (NEER) of the US dollar (27 economies)  appreciated by 7.8  per cent in  the calendar year 2022, up to December, while the NEER of India (64 economies) depreciated by 4.8 per cent. In other words, it is not that the INR has weakened, but it is the US dollar that has strengthened. No matter how many tweets are written against that observation, it is a fact. Several other currencies depreciated even more value against the US dollar than the INR (Refer Figure I.12 of Chapter I). Thus, the external value of INR vis-à-vis the US dollar has seen very orderly movements during the year since the onset of the current geopolitical crisis.

11.45   Further, the INR appreciated against select major currencies barring the US dollar.  The average exchange rate of INR against the Pound Sterling appreciated by 6.7 per cent in April -December 2022 over April - December 2021. This rate of appreciation was 14.5 per cent with respect to the Japanese Yen and 6.4 per cent against the Euro.

21 The U.S. dollar index (US$X) is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies. These are: the Euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Swedish krona.

11.46  Cross-country comparisons of exchange rate movements are often made on an inflationadjusted basis or what is called in real effective terms, viz. the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER).  On  a  financial  year  basis,  i.e.,  between April  2022  and  December  2022,  the  INR depreciated 3.4 per cent and 4.0 per cent measured in terms of 6-currency and 40-currency tradeweighted indices, respectively. Thus, even in real terms, the INR witnessed modest depreciation in the face of global spill overs.

11.47  In terms of the 6-currency NEER (trade-weighted), the rupee depreciated by 4.4 per cent in December 2022 over April 2022. Similarly, the rupee depreciated by 4.7 per cent in terms of 40-currency NEER 22   (trade-weighted) in December 2022 over April 2022.

22 The indices NEER and REER are used as indicators of external competitiveness. NEER is the weighted average of bilateral nominal exchange rates of the home currency in terms of foreign currencies, weights being based on the average of India's bilateral trade (exports plus imports) with countries/regions represented by the 6/40 currencies during the preceding three years. The REER, defined as a weighted average of nomi -nal exchange rates adjusted for relative price differential between the domestic and foreign countries, relates to the PPP hypothesis.
