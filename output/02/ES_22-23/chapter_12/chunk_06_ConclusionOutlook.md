## conclusion/outlook

12.83 Today, we are operating in the new normal where the global economy is still recovering from the setback due to pandemic, and geo-political conflicts persist. India could effectively steer  through  the  situation  owing  to  its  dedicated  support  to  infrastructure  creation  through increased capex and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. This underpinned economic growth when the private sector was cautious in investing due to its balance sheet problems and uncertain demand outlook stemming from global shocks.

12.84 The targeted  increase  in  investment  is  seen  across  all  infrastructure  sectors.  To  help sustain the investment drive, NIP provided a forward-looking roadmap of investible projects. Further, PM GatiShakti has helped accelerate infrastructure development by integrating the seven engines (roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport, waterways, and logistic infrastructure) of growth. While traditional infrastructure sectors such as roads and railways have received a renewed push in recent years, sectors such as inland water transport and civil aviation, which have significant untapped potential, are also being encouraged sufficiently. Parallelly, the focus is also on improving coordination among different stakeholders and ministries. This will help resolve compliance issues and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of investments.

12.85 Besides, the reforms being undertaken in energy and power sector will help fast-track India's progress in the next 25 years. With a population of nearly 140 crore, India has a massive demand for energy from all sectors including primary, secondary and tertiary. Affordable and

reliable availability of power is critical for India's aspirations for the manufacturing sector to be fulfilled. Further, with the growing importance of clean energy, there has been a renewed push towards non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in the power sector. The government, along with the private sector, has progressively worked towards increasing the share of renewables. This will ensure a gradual but calibrated energy transition, meeting the country's sustainability targets and giving primacy to its national developmental requirements.

12.86 With  the  advent  of  new  technologies,  we  are  witnessing  new  regulatory  challenges. Technology  and  innovation  are,  per  se,  neither  constructive  nor  destructive.  The  use  cases present the positive aspects of technology and innovation. The government is committed to keeping pace with the digital landscape developments including those related to legislations and frameworks. While the digital journey started with Aadhaar as a medium for service delivery at the doorstep, UPI strengthened the digital payment infrastructure. With other initiatives like CoWIN, e-RUPI, TReDS, Account Aggregators, ONDC, etc. at different stages of implementation, India has developed a unique and cogent digital story to tell.  The journey is ongoing and there is much untapped potential in India's digital public infrastructure space.

12.87 In sum, the synergy between physical and digital infrastructure will be one of the defining features of India's future growth story.
