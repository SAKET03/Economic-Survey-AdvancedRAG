4.7 Surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed post-Covid-19 in response to the Reserve Bank's conventional and unconventional monetary measures moderated during FY23 in consonance with the changed monetary policy stance that focused on the withdrawal of accommodation. With the MSF rate retained at 25 bps above the policy repo rate, the LAF corridor became symmetric around the policy repo rate - the corridor width was thus restored to 50 bps, the position that prevailed before the pandemic. The RBI's move to hike the CRR by 50 bps resulted in a withdrawal of primary liquidity to the tune of ₹87,000 crore from the banking system.

4.8 The daily net liquidity absorption averaged ₹2.5 lakh crore during FY23 (up to 21 December 2022) as compared with ₹6.7 lakh crore in FY22. The Reserve Bank remained nimble and agile in  liquidity  management  by  conducting  two-way  operations.  It  injected  liquidity  to  assuage transient liquidity tightness through two variable rate repo (VRR) auctions of ₹50,000 crore each of 3 days and overnight maturity on 26th July and 22nd September 2022, respectively. The gradual withdrawal of surplus liquidity pushed the weighted average call rate (WACR) - the operating target of monetary policy - closer to the policy repo rate, on an average basis. The WACR traded 6 bps above the policy repo rate, on an average, during H2 (up to 21 December 2022) compared to 28 bps below it during H1. Interest rates on various money market rates - 91day Treasury Bills (T-Bills), 3-month certificates of deposit and commercial papers - gradually firmed up in line with the increase in the repo rate.
