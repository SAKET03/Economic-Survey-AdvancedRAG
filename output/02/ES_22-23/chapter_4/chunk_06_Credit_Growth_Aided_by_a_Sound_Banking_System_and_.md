# Credit Growth Aided by a Sound Banking System and Deleveraged Corporate Sector

## Credit Growth Aided by a Sound Banking System and Deleveraged Corporate Sector

4.18  The recovery in economic activity in FY22, along with the enhanced financial soundness of banks and corporates, has bolstered the expansion of non-food bank credit since June 2021. The YoY growth in non-food bank credit accelerated to 15.3 per cent in December 2022. This not only shows an acceleration in the growth of current economic activities but also an anticipation of continued momentum in economic activity in future.

4.19  Credit growth has been broad-based across sectors, with retail credit driving the growth primarily owing to rising demand for home loans. An increase in demand for housing induces greater investment which, in turn, sets off a virtuous cycle of growth and investment. Credit to agriculture and allied activities gained momentum supported by the Government's concessional institutional  credit  and  higher  agricultural  credit  target.  Industrial  credit  growth  has  been buoyed by a pick-up in credit to MSMEs, assisted by the benefits accrued from the effective

implementation of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and the support provided by the government's production-linked incentive scheme and improvement in capacity utilisation. Credit growth in services was driven by a recovery in credit to NBFCs, commercial real estate and trade sectors.

4.20  With moderation in overseas issuances and lower investments by Private Equity (PE)/ Venture Capital (VC), the financing needs of the corporate sector are being met through domestic resources.   As  funds  raised  from  the  primary  segment  of  domestic  equity  markets  declined during FY23, reliance on bank credit for funding regular operations and capacity expansion increased. Also, the Incremental Credit-Deposit ratio rose sharply both on an annual (122.0 per cent, YoY) and half-yearly basis (172.5 per cent; September 2022 over March 2022). The accumulation of deposits in the past few years has enabled banks to fund the growing credit demand.  Here,  the  well-capitalised  banking  system  with  a  low  NPA  ratio  and  more  robust corporate sector fundamentals will continue to enhance the flow of bank credit into productive investment opportunities, notwithstanding the rising interest rates.

## Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) Continue to Recover

4.21  The growing importance of the NBFC sector in the Indian financial system is reflected in the consistent rise of NBFCs' credit as a proportion to GDP as well as in relation to credit extended by SCBs. Supported by various policy initiatives, NBFCs could absorb the shocks of  the  pandemic. They  built  up  financial  soundness  during  FY22,  marked  by  balance  sheet consolidation, improvement in asset quality, augmented capital buffers and profitability.

Note: Credit to NBFCs (per cent of GDP) for FY23 (H1) is estimated based on NSO's 1st AE for FY23 and credit by NBFCs as of September 2022.

4.22  The  continuous  improvement  in  asset  quality  is  seen  in  the  declining  GNPA  ratio  of NBFCs from the peak of 7.2 per cent recorded during the second wave of the pandemic (June 2021) to 5.9 per cent in September 2022, reaching close to the pre-pandemic level. Although this softening was observed across sectors, the GNPA ratio of the services sector remains in double digits.

4.23  With the decline in GNPAs, the capital position of NBFCs also remains robust, with a CRAR of 27.4 per cent in end-September 2022, slightly lower than 27.6 per cent in March 2022. However, it remains well above the regulatory requirement. The decline of 20 bps was mainly because of an increase in RWA as lending picked up. The RoA has recouped over successive half-years.  RBI's stress test to assess the resilience of the NBFC sector to credit risk shocks for a sample of 152 NBFCs reveals that the number of NBFCs that would fail to meet the minimum regulatory capital requirement of 15 per cent stood at 8 per cent under the baseline scenario. It increases to 10 per cent and 13 per cent under medium and severe stress scenarios, respectively.

4.24  Credit  extended  by  NBFCs  is  picking  up  momentum,  with  the  aggregate  outstanding amount  at  â‚¹31.5  lakh  crore  as  of  September  2022.  NBFCs  continued  to  deploy  the  largest quantum of credit from their balance sheets to the industrial sector, followed by retail, services, and agriculture. Loans to the services sector (share in outstanding credit being 14.7 per cent) and personal loans (share of 29.5 per cent) registered a robust double-digit growth.
