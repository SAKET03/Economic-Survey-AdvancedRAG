## Resilient and well-capitalised Banking System

4.14  Since the middle of the previous decade, RBI and the government have made dedicated efforts in terms of calibrated policy measures like strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework, implementation of 4R's approach of Recognition, Resolution, Recapitalisation and Reforms to clean and strengthen the balance sheet of the banking system. These continuous efforts over the years have culminated in the enhancement of risk absorption capacity and a healthier  banking  system  balance  sheet  both  in  terms  of  asset  quantity  and  quality  over  the years.

4.15  Consequently, the asset quality of SCBs has been improving steadily over the years across all major sectors. The GNPA ratio has decreased from 8.2 per cent in March 2020 to a sevenyear low of 5.0 per cent in September 2022, while Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA) have dropped to a ten-year low of 1.3 per cent of total assets. Lower slippages and the reduction in outstanding GNPAs through recoveries, upgrades and write-offs led to this decrease. Lower GNPAs, combined with high provisions accumulated in recent years, contributed to a decline in NNPA.  There was a broad-based improvement in the GNPA ratio in the industrial sector, though it remained elevated for gems and jewellery and construction sub-sectors. Going ahead, as per the baseline scenario of the RBI's stress testing framework, the declining tendency in the GNPA ratio is likely to continue and is projected to drop further to 4.9 per cent in March 2023.

4.16  Moreover,  with  shrinking  GNPAs,  the  Provisioning  Coverage  Ratio  (PCR)  has  been increasing steadily since March 2021 and reached 71.6 per cent in September 2022. The CRAR of  SCBs  has  been  rising  sequentially  in  the  post-asset  quality  review  period.  With  a  pickup in lending activity during H1:FY23, CRAR moderated in September 2022 because of an increase in risk-weighted assets (RWAs). However, it remains well above the minimum capital requirement, including Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) requirements of 11.5 per cent.

4.17  During  the  first  half  of  FY23,  the  profitability  of  SCBs,  measured  in  terms  of  Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA), improved to levels last observed in FY15. At the system level, Profit After Tax (PAT) witnessed a double-digit growth of 40.7 per cent in the quarter ending September 2022, led by strong growth in Net Interest Income (NII) and a significant lowering of provisions. Macro-stress tests conducted by RBI for credit risk reveal that SCBs are well-capitalised and that all banks would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under adverse stress scenarios.
