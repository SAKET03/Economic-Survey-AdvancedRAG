# Developments in the Insurance Market

## Developments in the Insurance Market

Insurance markets globally have demonstrated remarkable flexibility and resilience in overcoming the impact of the pandemic

4.51  Insurance, an integral part of the financial sector, plays a significant role in economic development.  Apart  from  protecting  against  mortality,  property,  and  casualty  risks  and providing a safety net, the insurance sector encourages savings and provides long-term funds for infrastructure development. The development of the insurance sector is necessary to support its continued economic transformation.

4.52  Internationally,  the  potential  and  performance  of  the  insurance  sector  are  generally assessed based on two parameters, viz., 'insurance penetration', which refers to the ratio of total insurance premiums to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in a year  and 'insurance density', which refers to the ratio of insurance premium to population, i.e.; insurance premium per capita and is measured in US Dollar, as they reflect the level of development of the insurance sector in a country. In 2021, total global insurance premiums grew by 3.4 per cent in real terms, with the non-life insurance sector registering 2.6 per cent growth, driven by rate hardening in commercial lines in developed markets. However, in China, the largest emerging market, non-life premium volumes contracted by 0.7 per cent as the de-tariffication 11 of motor insurance sparked fierce competition and rate reductions.

4.53  In the life insurance segment, global premium growth bounced back strongly, registering an increase of 4.5 per cent. The US remained the largest insurance market in the world, with total premiums (non-life and life) of US$ 2.8 trillion in 2021, followed by China and Japan. With the conflict in Ukraine weighing on economic growth in Europe in particular, it is expected that insurance industry growth in emerging markets will outpace that in the developed markets this year, with emerging Asia in the lead.

11    De-tariffication means removing the tariff structure. This allows insurance companies to charge premiums that matches the risk profiles of its consumers. Different insurance companies can charge at a different price to its consumers for the same risk behaviour based on their business risks models and strategies.

## India poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade

4.54  Insurance penetration in India increased steadily from 2.7 per cent around the turn of the millennium to 4.2 per cent in 2020 and remained the same in 2021. Life insurance penetration in India was 3.2 per cent in 2021, almost twice more than the emerging markets and slightly above the  global  average.  However,  most  life  insurance  products  sold  in  India  are  savings-linked, with  just  a  small  protection  component.  Hence,  households  remain  exposed  to  a  significant financing gap in the event of the premature death of the primary breadwinner. Be that as it may, the insurance density in India has increased from US$ 11.1 in 2001 to US$ 91 in 2021 (density for Life insurance was US$ 69 and Non-Life insurance was US$ 22 in 2021) in keeping with the relatively faster expansion of the insurance market in the country.

4.55  During FY22, the gross direct premium of non-Life insurers (within and outside India) registered YoY growth of 10.8 per cent, primarily driven by health and motor segments. The net incurred claims of non-Life insurers stood at ₹1.4 lakh crore in FY22, primarily driven by rising per capita income, product innovations and customisation, development of strong distribution channels, and rising financial literacy. The life insurance premium registered YoY growth of 10.2 per cent in FY22, with new businesses contributing 45.5 per cent of the total premiums received by the life insurers. The life insurance industry paid benefits of ₹5.02 lakh crore in FY22, out of which 8.3 per cent benefits were on death claims.

4.56  Public  listings  improve  public  disclosure,  corporate  governance,  and  valuation 12 .  In keeping with this understanding, India's largest life insurer, the Life Insurance Corporation of India, went public in May 2022, raising US$ 2.7 billion in the country's largest IPO to date. The private insurance providers have also been seizing such opportunities. The largest private-sector health insurer in the country, was listed in December 2021, making it the fifth private-sector insurer to IPO. The insurance sector is highly competitive and is already witnessing mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) activity as insurers have tremendous opportunities and volume to co-

exist in the space. Additional FDI inflows, IPOs, simplified rules &amp; regulations and improved corporate  valuations  will  likely  further  accelerate  M&amp;A  activities  in  the  sector.  A  rapidly maturing insurance market has provided a lucrative opportunity to the government to privatize its stake in insurance business. Accordingly, the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Amendment Act, 2021 allows the central government to pare its stake to less than 51 per cent of the equity capital in a specified insurer.

4.57  To facilitate the penetration of insurance to the lower income segments of the population, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDAI) issued IRDAI (Micro Insurance) Regulations, 2015, which provide a platform for distributing insurance products that are affordable for the rural and urban poor and promote financial inclusion. Further, the IRDAI (Obligations of Insurers to Rural and Social Sectors) Regulations, 2015 stipulate obligations for insurers in rural and social sectors and has contributed to developing and promoting microinsurance products in India. In FY21, 10.7 lakh new micro-insurance policies were issued to individuals with a new business premium of ₹355.3 crore (in the life-insurance segment), and 53,046 new microinsurance policies were issued in the general insurance segment (excluding standalone health insurers).

4.58  Government schemes and financial inclusion initiatives have driven insurance adoption and penetration across all segments. The government's flagship initiative for crop insurance, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), has led to significant growth in the premium income for crop insurance. Ayushman Bharat (Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana) (AB PMJAY) aims at providing a health cover of ₹5 lakh per family per year for secondary and tertiary care  hospitalisation.  The  insurance  regulator  IRDAI  has  also  undertaken  various  initiatives towards  boosting  insurance  penetration,  such  as  permitting  insurers  to  conduct  video-based Know Your Customer (KYC), launching standardised insurance products, and allowing insurers to offer rewards for low-risk behaviour. Important government initiatives, strong demographic factors, a conducive regulatory environment, increased M&amp;As, product innovations, and vibrant distribution channels are supporting the insurance market's growth.

4.59  Global  life  premiums  are  expected  to  contract  slightly  in  2022  after  last  year's  robust recovery from pandemic-induced lows driven by inflationary pressures, economic uncertainty, and  monetary  tightening.  Saving  premiums  are  expected  to  decline  due  to  volatility  in  the financial markets and as disposable incomes fall. Heightened risk awareness due to Covid-19 may continue to support demand for life protection (and health) insurance products.

4.60  As per the Swiss Re Institute World Insurance: 'Inflation risks front and centre report' 13 , India is one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the world. In total premium volumes, it  was the 10th largest globally in 2021, with an estimated market share of 1.9 per cent and the second largest of all emerging markets. India is expected to emerge as one of the top six insurance markets in the world by 2032, ahead of Germany, Canada, Italy, and South Korea. Further,  growth in the non-life insurance sector is likely to be driven by demand for health coverage, with people more aware of health security post-Covid-19 and strong support from

the government-sponsored mass health program (Ayushman Bharat). Compulsory motor thirdparty insurance will multiply as India's middle class expands and buys more cars.

4.61  The digitisation of India's insurance market goes beyond telematics and customer risk assessment. Many digital platforms have emerged over recent years, offering various services, including insurance purchases. These measures, accompanied by an increase in FDI limit for Insurance  Companies,  are  likely  to  facilitate  an  increased  flow  of  long-term  capital,  global technology, processes, and international best practices, which will support the growth of India's insurance sector.
