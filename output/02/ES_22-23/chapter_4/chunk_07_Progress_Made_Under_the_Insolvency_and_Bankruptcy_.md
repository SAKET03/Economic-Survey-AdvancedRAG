## ease of doing business: facilitating the process of 'exit'

4.25  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has facilitated the exit of distressed firms, thereby allocating scarce economic resources towards more productive use. Since the inception of the IBC in December 2016, 5,893 Corporate Insolvency Resolution Processes (CIRPs) had commenced by end-September 2022, of which 67 per cent have been closed. Of these, around 21 per cent were closed on appeal or review or settled, 19 per cent were withdrawn, 46 per cent ended in orders for liquidation, and 14 per cent culminated in the approval of resolution plans. The Code also provides for a Corporate Debtor (CD) to voluntarily liquidate itself subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions as prescribed under the Code. 1,351 corporate persons initiated voluntary liquidation under the Code as of end-September 2022.

4.26  Sectoral analysis reveals that 52 per cent of the ongoing CIRPs belong to industry, followed by 37 per cent in the services sector by September 2022. Further, within the industry, 74 per cent of the initiated CIRPs was from the manufacturing sector. Of these, the textile, basic metals and food sectors accounted for 48 per cent of the ongoing CIRPs. While in the services sector,

60 per cent of the ongoing CIRPs belongs to real estate, renting and business activities.

## Behavioural change: recoding Business relationships

4.27  One of the far-reaching spill-over effects of the Code has been the behavioural change effectuated by it among debtors. The fear of losing control over the CD upon initiation of CIRP has nudged thousands of debtors to settle their dues even before the initiation of insolvency proceedings.  Until  September  30  2022,  23,417  applications  for  initiation  of  CIRPs  of  CDs having underlying default of ₹7.3 lakh crore were disposed of before their admission into CIRP.

## 69 per cent of the distressed assets rescued, realisation value around 178 per cent of the liquidation value

4.28  Until September 30, 2022, 553 CIRPs have ended in resolution. Despite the very low value of the distressed firms to begin with, 69 per cent of distressed assets were rescued by the Code. Overall, in terms of value realisation for initiators of CIRPs (which includes Financial Creditors, Operational Creditors and Corporate Debtors), the resolution plans realised ₹2.4 lakh crore, which is 177.6 per cent of the liquidation value and 84 1 per cent of the fair value of the 553 CDs rescued. Moreover, realisation by financial creditors under resolution plans in comparison to liquidation value was 201 per cent, while the realisation by them was 33 per cent of their claims.

## 92 per cent of the value realised under the liquidation Process

4.29  1807 CDs ended up with orders for liquidation as of September 2022. These CDs assets were valued at less than 8 per cent of the aggregate claim amount on the ground. However, more than 76 per cent of the CIRPs ending in liquidation (1349 out of 1774 for which data are available) were earlier with the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and/ or are defunct. The economic value of most of the corporate debtors that ended in liquidation had almost completely eroded even before they were admitted into CIRP. 429 CDs have been completely liquidated. The Code has facilitated the realisation of 92 per cent of the value through the liquidation of these companies.

## NPAs: IBC recovers highest amount for Scheduled Commercial Banks

4.30  As per the RBI data, in FY 22, the total amount recovered by SCBs under IBC has been the highest compared to other channels such as Lok Adalat's, SARFAESI Act and DRTs in this period.

4.31  In  a  public  auction-based  resolution  model 2 such  as  the  IBC,  the  extent  of  the  haircut represents the discount the market demands for acquiring the stressed entity as a going concern. Since significant value destruction may have already happened in these assets, a comparison of realised value with admitted claims may not be a reasonable indicator of the effectiveness of the resolution process. Further, the rate of recovery is contingent on several factors, including the overall macroeconomic environment, perceived growth prospects of the entity and its sector, and the extent of erosion in the intrinsic value of the entity. As a broad-based recovery gains traction, these factors are likely to turn favourable for financial resolution 3 .
