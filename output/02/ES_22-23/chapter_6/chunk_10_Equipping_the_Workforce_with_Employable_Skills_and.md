# Equipping the Workforce with Employable Skills and Knowledge in Mission Mode

## equipping the Workforce with employable Skills and Knowledge in mission mode

6.75 Skill development is aimed at the removal of the disconnect between demand and supply of skilled manpower, building vocational and technical training framework, skill up-gradation, and building of new skills, and innovative thinking not only for existing jobs but also jobs of the future. In order to address the incremental manpower requirement and to empower youth with adequate skills,  the  Ministry  of  Skill  Development  and  Entrepreneurship  (MSDE)  was created in 2014 and Skill India Mission was launched in 2015. With the establishment of a Central Ministry, efforts to improve and streamline the skilling ecosystem were ramped up as the government launched the National Skill Development Mission as well as the National Policy on Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. Under the NEP 2020 also, there is a special focus on vocational education and skill development. Integration of vocational education with general education and mainstreaming of vocational education have been identified as the key reform in the education System of the country.

6.76 PLFS  FY21  shows  that  formal  vocational/technical  training  among  youth  (age  1529 years) and the working population (age 15-59 years) have improved in FY21 over FY19 and  FY20.  The  improvement  in  skills  has  been  for  males  and  females,  both  in  rural  and urban sectors.
