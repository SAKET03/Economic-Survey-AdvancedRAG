# Development of India's Aspiring Rural Economy

## development of india's aspiring rural economy

6.101 The percentage of the population living in India's rural areas was as high as around 80 per cent in the 1960s and remained over 70 per cent till 2007. It presently stands at 65 per cent for 2021. 49 Further, 47 per cent of the population is dependent on agriculture for livelihood. Thus, the focus of the government on rural development is imperative. The emphasis has been on improving the quality of life in rural areas to ensure more equitable and inclusive development. The aim of engagement of the government in the rural economy has been ' transforming lives and livelihoods through proactive socio-economic inclusion, integration, and empowerment of rural India.' 50

6.102 Various  measures  have  been  taken  to  enhance  the  quality  of  life  in  rural  areas encompassing rural housing, drinking water, and sanitation, clean fuel, social protection, rural connectivity along with enhancing rural livelihoods. The financing needs of rural households and small businesses are being met through microfinance institutions, self-help groups (SHGs), and  other  financial  intermediaries.  Taking  digitisation  and  technology  to  the  rural  economy has also been a key aspect of the rural development agenda, be it in agricultural activities or governance. A primary focus has also been on the health parameters of the rural population, with enhanced emphasis necessitated by the pandemic. The improvements in these aspects are discussed in the following paragraphs.

6.103 The NFHS data for 2019-21 illustrates a significant improvement vis-à-vis 2015-16 in an array of indicators concerning the quality of rural lives, including, inter alia ,  access to electricity,  presence  of  improved  drinking  water  sources,  coverage  under  health  insurance schemes, etc. Women empowerment has also gained momentum, with visible progress in female participation in household decision-making, owning bank accounts, and use of mobile phones. Most of the indicators concerning the health of rural women and children have improved. These outcome-oriented statistics establish tangible medium-run progress in rural living standards, aided by the policy focus on basic amenities and efficient programme implementation. Some of the important schemes/programmes of the Government in various areas to improve the quality of life in rural areas are detailed in the following paragraphs.

## enhancing rural incomes

## deendayal antyodaya yojana-national rural livelihood mission (day-nrlm)

6.104 NRLM aims to enable economically weak households to access gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities resulting in sustainable and diversified livelihood options for them. This is one of the world's largest initiatives to improve the livelihoods of the poor. The Mission seeks to achieve its objective through investing in four core components viz., (a) social mobilisation and promotion and strengthening of self-managed and financially sustainable  community  institutions  of  the  rural  poor  women;  (b)  financial  inclusion;  (c) sustainable livelihoods; and (d) social inclusion, social development, and access to entitlements through convergence.

6.105 The cornerstone of the Mission is its ' community-driven' approach which has provided a huge platform in the form of community institutions for women empowerment. Rural women are at the core of the program which is extensively focused on their socio-economic empowerment

54 Decisions about health care for herself, making major household purchases, and visits to her family or relatives.

by way of building their capacities, providing financial support, and training in order to enable them to  undertake  livelihoods  activities  and  become  financially  independent.  Nearly  4  lakh SHG members have been trained as Community Resource Persons (CRPs) (viz. Pashu Sakhi, Krishi  Sakhi,  Bank  Sakhi,  BimaSakhi,  PoshanSakhi  etc.)  help  in  the  implementation  of  the Mission at the ground level.

6.106 The Mission has its footprint across 6,880 blocks in 723 districts across all states and UTs (except Delhi and Chandigarh) under its implementation strategy. It has mobilised a total of 8.7 crore women from poor and vulnerable communities into 81 lakh SHGs. The progress of the programme on key components is summarised below.

## mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee Scheme

6.107 The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA) aims at enhancing the livelihood security of households in rural areas of the country by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. In case employment is not provided within 15 days from the date of registration of the demand for work or the date from which work has been demanded in case of advance applications, whichever is later, the worker is entitled to a daily unemployment allowance.

6.108 A total of 5.6 crore households availed employment and a total of 225.8 crore person-days employment has been generated under the Scheme (until 6 January 2023). The physical progress of  MGNREGS in terms of person-days generation, average person-days per household, and participation of women are indicated below. Box VI.11 lists the achievements and governance measures under the MGNREGA.

## box Vi.11: achievements under mgnrega

geo-tagging of the assets : Geo MGNREGA Phase-I was rolled out on 1 September 2016 for geotagging of all completed works which started before 1 November 2017, under the scheme. GeoMGNREGA Phase-II was rolled out on 1 November 2017 and under this phase, the geo-tagging of  assets  is  carried  out  in  three  stages  viz:  before  initiation  of  work,  during  the  work,  and  after completion of work. More than 5.2 crore assets have been geo-tagged (as of 6 January 2023) and made available in the public domain.

mandatory expenditure on agriculture and allied activities : As per the provision of the Act, the District Programme Coordinator is required to ensure that at least 60 per cent of the works to be taken up in a district in terms of cost shall be for the creation of productive assets directly linked to agriculture and allied activities through development of land, water, and trees. The expenditure on agriculture and allied activities is 68.5 per cent in FY23 (as of 6 January 2023).

e-payments : e-payments are done under MGNREGA using National Electronic Fund Management System  (Ne-FMS)/  Electronic  Fund  Management  System  (e-FMS)  for  the  payment  of  wages  of workers directly to their bank/post office accounts. So far, total expenditure through NeFMS/e-FMS is 99.7 per cent.

dbt : Under the scheme, 99 per cent of wage seekers are receiving their wages directly into their bank accounts. It is a big step towards transparency.

aadhaar-based payment : 14.0 crore Aadhaar have been seeded in Management Information System (MIS) which is 92.0 per cent of total active workers (15.3 crore). A total of 7.9 crore workers have been linked to Aadhaar Based Payment System.

Some of the good governance initiatives under the Scheme are:

- (a) The Job Cards (JC) need to be verified and updated from time to time to weed out the bogus JCs, duplicates, and for reasons like migration and death. The states/ UTs have taken up this exercise to verify/ update the JCs.
- (b) As a good governance initiative, the number of Registers (average 22 Registers in a Gram Panchayat)  being  maintained  at  every  Gram  Panchayat  has  been  brought  down  to  seven Registers.
- (c) Cases of violation of Guidelines and Schedules are being followed up regularly. The Interstate Standard Operating Procedures (SoP) for visits were developed to improve the quality of the social audit process for all the states/UTs. This SoP will ensure all the Social Audit compliance as per Audit Standard Rule, 2011 which includes the establishment of an independent social audit unit, independent social audit director, and complete human resources to be trained as Village  Resource  Persons  (VRPs),  timely  calendar  upload  on  MIS,  timely  conduct  of  the regular audit and uploading the issues on MIS within the stipulated timeline.
- (d) MGNREGA workers are being trained  under  recent  initiatives  like  Bare  Foot  Technicians (BFT) to move them up the skilling ladder. So far, 8,394 BFTs have been trained in 20 States.
- (e) The  project  'UNNATI'  intends  to  upgrade  the  skill  base  of  the  MGNREGS  workers,  and thereby improve their livelihoods so that they can move from their current partial employment to full employment. This project was launched in the FY20 and aims to enhance the skill base of 2 lakh MGNREGA beneficiaries in three years i.e., FY20, FY21, and, FY22. So far, about 27,383 candidates have been trained. UNNATI skilling project is meant to provide training to  one  adult  member (of age 18-45 years) of a household who has completed 100 days of work under MGNREGA in the financial year from FY19. Full expenditures towards a stipend, against wage loss compensation, are entirely borne by the Central Government. A total of 2 lakh beneficiaries are to be imparted training in 26 States and 2 UTs.
- (f) Around 5.5  crore  households  fall  under  the  category  of  landless  households  dependent  on manual casual labour for livelihood as per the SECC 2011. The Government is making all efforts  to  get  these  households,  not  having  JCs,  to  obtain  employment  under  MGNREGA. Around 4.6 crore such households have been surveyed.
- (g) Area Officer Monitoring App was launched in May 2021, in a bid to facilitate the authorities to record their findings online. It will also help in recording time-stamped and geo-coordinate tagged photographs for all the schemes of the Department of Rural Development. It facilitates analysis of findings which in turn help in the implementation of the programme in a better manner.
- (h) National Mobile Monitoring Software (NMMS) App was launched in May 2021 which permits taking  real-time  attendance  of  workers  at  MGNREGA  worksites  along  with  a  geo-tagged photograph. This app is a big step towards bringing transparency and proper monitoring of the schemes and will help in increasing citizen oversight of the programme.

## deen dayal upadhyaya grameen Kaushalya yojana (ddu-gKy)

6.109 DDU-GKY is a placement-linked skill development programme for rural poor youth under  the  NRLM.  It  is  a  market-led,  placement-linked  skill  development  programme  for providing wage employment to rural poor youth. Until 30 November 2022, a total of 13,06,851 candidates have been trained under this scheme of which 7,89,685 have got job placements.

## rural Housing

- 6.110 Housing is one of the basic necessities, along with food and clothing. 'Housing for All by 2022' was rolled out to provide shelter with dignity for each and every one. With this target, the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana -Gramin (PMAY-G) was launched in November 2016 with  the  aim  of  providing  around  3  crore  pucca  houses  with  basic  amenities  to  all  eligible houseless households living in kutcha and dilapidated houses in rural areas by 2024. Through convergence with other Government Schemes, the PMAY-G also addresses basic needs such as the construction of the toilet, piped drinking water, electricity connection, LPG gas connection, and 90/95 person-days of unskilled labour from MGNREGS.
- 6.111 To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, PMAY-G selects beneficiaries using housing deprivation parameters in the SECC, 2011 date which is to be verified by the Gram Sabhas .  Under the scheme, landless beneficiaries are accorded the highest priority in the allotment of houses. A total of 2.7 crore houses have been sanctioned and 2.1 crore houses have been completed by 6 January 2023 under the Scheme. Against the total target of completion of 52.8 lakh houses in FY23, 32.4 lakh houses have been completed.

## drinking Water and Sanitation

6.112 The  UN-SDG6  aims  to  ' Ensure  availability  and  sustainable  management  of  water and sanitation for all.' India has made considerable progress in providing drinking water and safe sanitation to urban and rural households. Some details of key schemes/programmes under operation towards achieving the SDG goal on water and sanitation, are listed below.

## Jal Jeevan mission

- 6.113 The  Government  has  accorded  the  highest  priority  to  improve  the  quality  of  life and enhance the 'ease of living' of people, especially those living in rural areas. On the 73 rd Independence  Day,  15  August  2019,  the  Jal  Jeevan  Mission  (JJM)  was  announced,  to  be implemented in partnership with States, to provide tap water connection to every rural household and  public  institutions  in  villages  like  schools,  Anganwadi  centres, ashram  shalas (tribal residential schools), health centres, Gram Panchayat building, etc., by 2024.
- 6.114 At the time of the rollout of the JJM in August 2019, about 3.2 crore (17 per cent) households out of the total of 18.9 crore rural households had a tap water supply. Since the launch of the Mission, as of 18 January 2023, of 19.4 crore rural households, 11.0 crore households are getting tap water supply in their homes. Further, four States, i.e., Goa, Gujarat, Telangana &amp; Haryana, and three UTs, i.e., Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, Dadra Nagar Haveli &amp; Daman Diu and Puducherry have become ' Har Ghar Jal' State/ UT, i.e., 100 per cent households are having tap water supply. Similarly, 121 districts, 1,515 Blocks, 82,071 Gram Panchayats, and more than 1.5 lakh villages have also become ' Har Ghar Jal Block' , ' Har Ghar Jal Panchayat' , and

' Har Ghar Jal Gaon' respectively. Further, more than 8.8 lakh schools and 9.1 lakh Anganwadi centres  are  getting  potable  piped  water  supply.  Box  VI.12  provides  more  details  about  the Mission and how it is serving to improve public health.

## box Vi.12: Jal Jeevan mission as an instrument of public health

A recent study by Kremer et al. (2022) estimated that supply of microbiological contamination free water through Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) can prevent 1.36 lakh deaths of under-5 children every year. 57 Thus, water treatment is likely to have sizeable net benefits and is complementary to steps such as Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in preventing child mortality through improved hygiene.

With the availability of safe and potable drinking water at the doorstep of every rural household, water-borne diseases have drastically reduced from 1.8 crore in 2019 to 59.0 lakh in 2021, as per data from Directorate General of Health Services, M/o Health and Family Welfare. 58

## Steps taken for ensuring water quality

-  JJM stresses on the provision of potable water of adequate quantity and good quality as prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards. Water quality monitoring &amp; surveillance activities are given top priority under the mission.
-  To bring focus on water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH), thus to improve public health, a nation-wide Water Quality Management Information System (WQMIS) has been launched on by using field testing kits as well as water quality testing in laboratories. The data is uploaded, analyzed and in case of quality issues, local authorities are alerted to take up immediate remedial action.

-  Five women in each village, preferably including at least one ASHA worker and one Anganwadi worker, are being trained to test water samples of any kind of contamination by using Field Test Kits (FTKs). FTKs are procured and handed over to Panchayats. The FTK helps to test water on nine parameters viz. pH, alkalinity, chloride, nitrate, total hardness, fluoride, iron, residual free chlorine and H2S. Until December 2022, 16.2 Lakh women have been trained in nearly 2.0 lakh villages on Water Quality Testing through FTKs, and more than 58.0 Lakh water samples have been tested.
-  There are 2,067 water testing laboratories in the country. Of these, 657 laboratories are NABL accredited. Water testing laboratories have been opened to the public to get their water samples tested at nominal rates. Many States have provided mobile vans to enable collecting and testing water samples in faraway remote villages. In FY23, until December 2022, more than 27.0 lakh water samples have been tested in laboratories.
-  To assess the performance of various local water utilities in states/UTs, a functionality assessment exercise is undertaken every year to assess the status of water service delivery to households. As per functionality assessment of household tap connection - 2022, 87 per cent of the sample households received potable water.
-  As on 10 October 2022, 8.7 lakh schools (84.6 per cent) and 8.9 lakh (80.6 per cent) Anganwadi centers  across  the  country  have  been  provided  with  potable  tap  water  supply  for  drinking  &amp; cooking mid-day meals, hand-washing and use in toilets.
-  100-days  water  quality  campaign  'Swachh  Jal  Se  Suraksha'  was  announced  on  2  October 2022 focusing on awareness creation on the importance of water quality through Information, Education,  and  Communication,  training  activities  and  capacity  building  of  villagers  using citizen science approach.
-  Five 'Centers for Sustainable Drinking Water', in various IITs, supported by the JJM are working on developing innovations and technologies for bringing sustainability in drinking water.

Having achieved the ODF status in all villages in the country as of 2 October 2019, Phase-II of SBM (G) is now being implemented during FY21 to FY25, with the focus to sustain the ODF status of villages and covering all the villages with Solid and Liquid Waste Management, i.e., to convert the villages from ODF to ODF Plus. About 1,24,099 villages have been declared ODF plus till 10 November 2022 under this Mission. Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands has declared all its villages as ODF plus model, thus becoming the first Swachh, Sujal Pradesh .

## lpg connections

- 6.118 The government is continuing to support the vulnerable as commodity prices, including that of essentials, have remained volatile in the past year. This includes supporting the households with subsidised cooking fuel.
- 6.119 Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana 2.0, Swachh Indhan Behtar Jeevan : The 'Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana' (PMUY) was launched in May 2016 as a flagship scheme to make clean cooking fuel such as LPG available to rural and deprived households which were otherwise using  traditional  cooking  fuels  such  as  firewood,  coal,  cow-dung  cakes,  etc.  The  usage  of traditional cooking fuels had detrimental impacts on the health of rural women as well as on the environment. The release of 9.5 crore LPG connections under the scheme has also helped in increasing the LPG coverage from 62 per cent on 1 May 2016 to 99.8 per cent as on 1 April 2021.
- 6.120 Under the Union Budget for FY22, provision for the release of an additional one crore LPG connections under the PMUY scheme, i.e., Ujjwala 2.0, has been made. This scheme will offer deposit-free LPG connection, first refill and hot plate free of cost to beneficiaries, and a simplified enrolment procedure. In this phase, a special facility has been given to migrant families.  Under  this  Ujjwala  2.0  scheme,  1.6  crore  connections  have  been  released  until  24 November 2022.
