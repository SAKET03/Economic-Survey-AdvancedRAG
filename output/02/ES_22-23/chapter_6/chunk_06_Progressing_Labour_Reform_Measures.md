## progressing labour reform measures

The new laws are in tune with the changing labour market trends and, at the same time, accommodate the minimum wage requirement and welfare  needs  of  the  unorganised  sector  workers,  including  the  self-employed  and  migrant workers, within the legislation framework. The Labour Codes have been aligned with the present economic  scenario  and  technological  advancements  along  with  reduction  in  multiplicity  of definitions and authorities. The Codes also ease compliance mechanism aiming to promote ease of doing business/setting up of enterprises and catalyse creation of employment opportunities while ensuring safety, health and social security of every worker. Use of technology, such as, web-based Inspection has been introduced in order to ensure transparency and accountability in enforcement. Decriminalisation of minor offences has also been provided in the Labour Codes.
