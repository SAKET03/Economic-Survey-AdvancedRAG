## aadhaar: the many achievements of the unique identity

6.21 Aadhaar,  a  12-digit  unique  identification  number  provides  a  digital  identity  to  the residents of India and ensures authentication. It connects the Government and the individual, replacing the disentangled web of multiple IDs for multiple purposes, and secures the social contract between the State and the Citizen. It is because of the initiative taken in 2010 that today, the nation is consistently building and strengthening a digital economy which will ultimately give a global competitive advantage in how money and goods move around the country over its competitors.

6.22 Paul Romer, a Nobel laureate and former World Bank Chief Economist, has described what 135 crore citizens of India, which is 94 per cent of the population and 100 per cent of the adult (&gt;18 years), have as 'the most sophisticated ID programme in the world.' 11 Aadhaar provides  a  conclusive  connection  between  the  photograph  of  the  Aadhaar  holder,  his/her fingerprints, and iris scan details.

- 6.24 The key usages of Aadhaar in the daily lives of citizens are:
- Aadhaar - Usage in DBT : When linked with a bank account, an Aadhaar becomes the 'Financial  Address'  of  an  individual,  which  helps  to  accomplish  the  country's  goal  of financial inclusion. The number is sufficient to transfer any payment to an individual's bank account through Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB), thus eliminating the need to give other details,  viz.  the  bank  account,  IFSC  Code,  and  bank  branch  details  to  the  Government/ Institutions.
- Aadhaar Enabled Payment Systems (AEPS): AEPS helps an individual to do basic banking transactions, viz. withdrawal, cash deposit, transfer of funds from his bank account, etc., by simply using his Aadhaar. This has immensely facilitated providing door-step banking services and helped mitigate the hardships of the people due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
- JAM (Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile ) trinity,  combined  with  the  power  of  DBT,  has brought the marginalised sections of society into the formal financial system, revolutionising the path of transparent and accountable governance by empowering the people. Till November 2022, multiple large central schemes, including PAHAL, MGNREGS, etc., have paid over ` 7,66,055.9 crore through over 1,010 crore successful transactions. 12
- One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) Scheme : Aadhaar has played a key role in the implementation  of  the  ONORC  Scheme.  While  Aadhaar  seeding  of  the  PDS  database has  resulted  in  significant  savings  due  to  eliminating  ghost  and  duplicate  beneficiaries. Grain disbursal through Aadhaar-based Biometric Authentication has brought meaningful transparency and back-office improvement of the logistic network of PDS. Free distribution of food grains under 'Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana' (PMGKY) has greatly mitigated the Covid pandemic's impact, especially for the weakest and most vulnerable sections of society.
- PM Kisan Samman Nidhi: Aadhaar platform forms the backbone for the implementation of this scheme, right from registration through Aadhaar eKYC to DBT through the APB.
- Co-WIN: Successful management of the Covid pandemic without the Co-WIN platform would  not  have  been  possible.  Aadhaar  played  a  vital  role  in  developing  the  Co-WIN platform and in the transparent administration of over 2 billion vaccine doses.

- Face  Authentication: The  use  of  face  as  an  additional  modality  of  authentication  is increasing. This  has  helped,  especially  the  elderly,  to  get  'Jeevan  Praman'  through  their smartphones to avail of pension.
