# India's Economic Resilience and Growth Drivers

## India's economic Resilience and Growth Drivers

1.14  Monetary tightening by the RBI, the widening of the CAD, and the plateauing growth of exports have essentially been the outcome of geopolitical strife in Europe.  As these developments posed downside risks to the growth of the Indian economy in FY23, many agencies worldwide have been revising their growth forecast of the Indian economy downwards. These forecasts, including the advance estimates released by the NSO, now broadly lie in the range of 6.5-7.0 per cent.  Despite the downward revision, the growth estimate for FY23 is higher than for almost all major economies and even slightly above the average growth of the Indian economy in the decade leading up to the pandemic. IMF estimates India to be one of the top two fast-growing significant economies in 2022. Despite strong global headwinds and tighter domestic monetary policy, if India is still expected to grow between 6.5 and 7.0 per cent, and that too without the advantage of a base effect, it is a reflection of India's underlying economic resilience; of its ability to recoup, renew and re-energise the growth drivers of the economy.

1.15  India's economic resilience can be seen in the domestic stimulus to growth seamlessly replacing the external stimuli. The growth of exports may have moderated in the second half of FY23. However, their surge in FY22 and the first half of FY23 induced a shift in the gears of the production processes from mild acceleration to cruise mode. Manufacturing and investment activities  consequently  gained  traction.  By  the  time  the  growth  of  exports  moderated,  the rebound in domestic consumption had sufficiently matured to take forward the growth of India's economy. Private Consumption as a percentage of GDP stood at 58.4 per cent in Q2 of FY23, the highest among the second quarters of all the years since 2013-14, supported by a rebound in contact-intensive services such as trade, hotel and transport, which registered sequential growth of 16 per cent in real terms in Q2 of FY23 compared to the previous quarter.

1.16  Although domestic consumption rebounded in many economies, the rebound in India was impressive for its scale. It contributed to a rise in domestic capacity utilisation. Domestic private consumption remains buoyant in November 2022, as indicated by Motilal Oswal's Economic Activity Index. The index estimates that private consumption grew at a five-month high pace of 5.6 per cent YoY, driven by auto sales and broad-based expansion of services. 2

1.17  The near-universal coverage of vaccination in India overseen by the government was the single most important reason that brought people out to the streets to re-experience the 'bazaar' as the marketplace was rapidly populated with service providers returning to resume business. The contact-based service providers like restaurants, hotels, shopping malls, cinemas, and tourist destinations, among others, soon ran up a thriving business and have significantly contributed to keeping up the consumer sentiments, as captured in repeated surveys. If, on the one hand, the universal vaccination coverage saved lives, on the other, it served as a health stimulant to raise consumer sentiments and thus the recovery and growth of the economy.

1.18  The rebound in consumption has also been supported by the release of 'pent-up' demand, a phenomenon not again unique to India but nonetheless exhibiting a local phenomenon influenced by a rise in the share of consumption in disposable income. Since the share of consumption in disposable income is high in India, a pandemic-induced suppression of consumption built up that much greater recoil force. Hence, the consumption rebound may have lasting power. Accelerating growth  in  personal  loans  in  India  testifies  to  an  enduring  release  of  'pent-up'  demand  for consumption. RBI's most recent survey 3 of  consumer confidence released in December 2022 pointed to improving sentiment with respect to current and prospective employment and income conditions.

1.19  The 'release of pent-up demand' was reflected in the housing market too. Demand for housing loans picked up. Consequently, housing inventories have declined, prices are firming up, and construction of new dwellings is picking up pace. This has stimulated innumerable backward and forward linkages that the construction sector is known to carry. The universalisation of vaccination coverage also has a significant role in lifting the housing market as, in its absence, the migrant workforce could not have returned to construct new dwellings.

1.20  Apart from housing, construction activity, in general, has significantly risen in FY23 as the much-enlarged capital budget (Capex) of the central government and its public sector enterprises is rapidly being deployed. Going by the Capex multiplier estimated for the country, the economic output of the country is set to increase by at least four times the amount of Capex. 4,5 States, in aggregate, are also performing well with their Capex plans. Like the central government, states also have a larger capital budget supported by the centre's grant-in-aid for capital works and an interest-free loan repayable over 50 years.

1.21  A capex thrust in the last two budgets of the Government of India was not an isolated initiative meant only to address the infrastructure gaps in the country. It was part of a strategic package  aimed  at  crowding-in  private  investment  into  an  economic  landscape  broadened by the vacation of non-strategic PSEs (disinvestment) and idling public sector assets. Three developments support this 6 . First, the significant increase in the Capex budget in FY23, as well as its high rate of spending. Second, direct tax revenue collections have been highly buoyant, and  so  have  GST  collections,  which  should  ensure  the  full  expending  of  the  Capex  budget within the budgeted fiscal deficit. The growth in revenue expenditure has also been limited to pave the way for higher growth in Capex. Third, the pick-up in private sector investment since the January-March quarter of 2022. Evidence shows an increasing trend in announced projects and capex spending by the private players. Surveys of leading industry CEOs also reveal their plans and commitment to increasing Capex.

1.22  While  an  increase  in  export  demand,  rebound  in  consumption,  and  public  capex  have contributed  to  a  recovery  in  the  investment/manufacturing  activities  of  the  corporates,  their stronger balance sheets have also played a big part equal measure to realising their spending plans. As per the data on non-financial debt from the Bank for International Settlements, in the course of the last decade, Indian non-financial private sector debt and non-financial corporate debt as a share of GDP declined by nearly thirty percentage points. This limited the increase in interest costs, which, together with possible savings on overheads during lockdowns, contributed to the recent fortification of corporate balance sheets by higher profits. In FY22, the surge in

exports also contributed to increasing profits in the corporate world. After-tax profits were also boosted by the lower taxes announced in 2019. Better profitability helped corporates pay down debt. Consequently, not only do corporates have more scope to borrow now, but their improved financial health has also reassured their prospective lenders to expand their credit portfolios. As per Axis Bank Business and Economic Research, Capex by the Corporate sector increased to â‚¹3.3 lakh crore in H1 of FY23, driven by heavy investments in electricity, steel, chemicals, auto and pharmaceuticals sectors.

1.23  The banking sector in India has responded in equal measure to the demand for credit. The Year-on-Year growth in credit since the January-March quarter of 2022 has moved into double-digits  and  is  rising  across  most  sectors.  The  credit  growth  to  the  MSME  sector  has been remarkably high, over 30.5 per cent, on average, during Jan-Nov 2022, supported by the extended ECLGS of the central government. The aggressive supply of credit by the banking sector has as much been triggered by their improved financial health as that of the corporates. The finances of the public sector banks have seen a significant turnaround, with profits being booked  at  regular  intervals  and  their  Non-Performing Assets  (NPAs)  being  fast-tracked  for quicker resolution/liquidation by the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (IBBI). At the same time, the government has been providing adequate budgetary support for keeping the PSBs well-capitalized,  ensuring  that  their  Capital  Risk-Weighted Adjusted  Ratio  (CRAR)  remains comfortably above the threshold levels of adequacy. The successful macro stress tests performed on the banking sector further testify to its financial strength. It does help that the banking sector has negligible cross-border claims in times when currency risk is high. Nonetheless, financial strength has helped banks make up for lower debt financing provided by corporate bonds and External Commercial Borrowings (ECBs) so far in FY23. Rising yields on corporate bonds and higher interest/hedging costs on ECBs have made these instruments less attractive than the previous year.

1.24  RBI has projected headline inflation at 6.8 per cent in FY23, which is outside its target range. At the same time, it is not high enough to deter private consumption and also not so low as to weaken the inducement to invest. Moderately high inflation has further ensured the anchoring of inflationary expectations preventing prices from weakening demand and growth in India. Additionally, with inflation on the declining path, the interest cost of domestic credit will likely decline, inducing a further increase in demand for credit by corporates and retail borrowers.
