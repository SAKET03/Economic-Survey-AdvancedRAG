## macroeconomic and Growth challenges in the Indian economy

1.10  The impact of the pandemic on India was seen in a significant GDP contraction in FY21. The following year, FY22, the Indian economy started to recover despite the Omicron wave of  January  2022.  This  third  wave  did  not  affect  economic  activity  in  India  as  much  as  the previous waves of the pandemic did since its outbreak in January 2020. Mobility enabled by localised lockdowns, rapid vaccination coverage, mild symptoms and quick recovery from the virus contributed to minimising the loss of economic output in the January-March quarter of 2022. Consequently, output in FY22 went past its pre-pandemic level in FY20, with the Indian economy staging a  full  recovery  ahead  of  many  nations.  The  experience  with  the  Omicron variant  engendered  a  cautious  optimism  that  it  was  possible  to  stay  physically  mobile  and engage in economic activities despite the pandemic.  FY23 thus opened with a firm belief that the pandemic was rapidly on the wane and that India was poised to grow at a fast pace and quickly ascend to the pre-pandemic growth path.

1.11  However,  the  conflict  in  Europe  necessitated  a  revision  in  expectations  for  economic growth and inflation in FY23. The country's retail inflation had crept above the RBI's tolerance range in January 2022. It remained above the target range for ten months before returning to below the upper end of the target range of 6 per cent in November 2022. During those ten months, rising international commodity prices contributed to India's retail inflation as also local

weather conditions like excessive heat and unseasonal rains, which kept food prices high. The government cut excise and customs duties and restricted exports to restrain inflation while the RBI, like other central banks, raised the repo rates and rolled back excess liquidity.

1.12  With  monetary  tightening,  the  US  dollar  has  appreciated  against  several  currencies, including  the  rupee.  However,  the  rupee  has  been  one  of  the  better-performing  currencies worldwide, but the modest depreciation it underwent may have added to the domestic inflationary pressures besides widening the CAD. Global commodity prices may have eased but are still higher compared to pre-conflict levels. They have further widened the CAD, already enlarged by India's growth momentum. For FY23, India has sufficient forex reserves to finance the CAD and intervene in the forex market to manage volatility in the Indian rupee.

1.13  For  many countries around the world, including India, 2021 was a period of recovery for health and economies from the impact of the pandemic. For the advanced economies, in particular,  the  enormous  fiscal  stimulus  earlier  injected  by  their  governments  supported  a strong demand revival. Growth in world trade subsequently followed, of which India was also a  beneficiary.  India's  exports  surged in FY22, and the momentum lasted up to the first half of FY23. Export growth was strong enough to increase India's share in the world market of merchandise exports. However, due to aggressive and synchronised monetary tightening, global economic growth has started to slow, and so has world trade. As per United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) latest global trade update, global trade growth turned negative during the H2:2022, and geopolitical frictions, persisting inflationary pressures, and subdued demand are expected to suppress global trade further in 2023. This is likely to affect many countries, including India, with the prospects of sluggish exports continuing into FY24, compared to the promise shown at the beginning of the current year.
