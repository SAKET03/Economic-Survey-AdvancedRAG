## India's Inclusive Growth

1.25  Growth  is  inclusive  when  it  creates  jobs.  Both  official  and  unofficial  sources  confirm that  employment levels  have  risen  in  the  current  financial  year.  The  Periodic  Labour  Force Survey (PLFS) shows that the urban unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and above declined from 9.8 per cent in the quarter ending September 2021 to 7.2 per cent one year later (quarter ending September 2022). This is accompanied by an improvement in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) as well, confirming the emergence of the economy out of the pandemicinduced slowdown early in FY23. Job creation appears to have moved into a higher orbit with the initial surge in exports, a strong release of the 'pent-up' demand, and a swift rollout of the capex. Since export growth is plateauing and the 'pent-up' release of demand will have a finite life,  it  is  essential  that  capex  continues  to  grow to facilitate employment in the economy, at least until such time the global economy rebounds and, through the export channel, provides an additional window to India for job creation. Thankfully, the private sector has all the necessary pre-conditions lined up to step up to the plate and do the capex heavy lifting. Their internal resource generation is good, capacity utilisation is high, and the demand outlook continues to improve. Capital markets are willing to finance new investments, as are financial institutions.

1.26  In FY21, the Government announced the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme. The scheme has succeeded in shielding micro, small and medium enterprises from financial distress. A recent CIBIL report (ECLGS Insights, August 2022) showed that the scheme has supported MSMEs in facing the covid shock, with 83 per cent of the borrowers that availed of the ECLGS

being micro-enterprises. Among these micro units, more than half had an overall exposure of less than ₹10 lakh. Furthermore, CIBIL data also shows that ECLGS borrowers had lower nonperforming asset rates than enterprises that were eligible for ECLGS but did not avail of it. Further, the GST paid by MSMEs after declining in FY21 has been rising since and now has crossed the pre-pandemic level of FY20, reflecting the financial resilience of small businesses and the effectiveness of the pre-emptive government intervention targeted towards MSMEs.

1.27  The scheme implemented by the government under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) has been rapidly creating more assets in respect of 'Works on individual's land' than in any other category. The share of this category rose to about 60 per cent in FY22, indicating that MGNREGA, besides generating daily wage employment, has  also  been  creating  assets  for  individual  households  to  diversify  their  sources  of  income

and lift their supplementary incomes. Details on asset creation under MGNREGA are further discussed in Chapters 6  'Social Infrastructure and Employment: Big Tent'. In addition, schemes like PM-KISAN, which benefits households covering half the rural population, and PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana have significantly contributed to lessening impoverishment in the country. The UNDP Report of July 2022  stated that the recent inflationary episode in India would have a low poverty impact due to well-targeted support. In addition, the National Family Health Survey (NFHS) in India shows improved rural welfare indicators from FY16 to FY20, covering aspects like gender, fertility rate, household amenities, and women empowerment.

1.28  The  year  FY23  so  far  for  India  has  reinforced  the  country's  belief  in  its  economic resilience. The economy has withstood the challenge of mitigating external imbalances caused by the Russian-Ukraine conflict without losing growth momentum in the process. India's stock markets had a positive return in CY22, unfazed by withdrawals by foreign portfolio investors. India's inflation rate did not creep too far above its tolerance range compared to several advanced nations  and  regions. A  relatively  higher  growth  forecast  among  major  economies,  projected retail inflation only slightly higher than the tolerance limit, and an estimated current account deficit financeable with normal capital inflows and forex reserves large enough to finance close to a year's imports are clear evidence of economic resilience amidst a global polycrisis. Strong consumption rebound, robust revenue collections, sustained capex in both the public and the private sector, growing employment levels in the urban as well as the rural areas, and targeted social security measures further underpin the prospects for economic and social stability and sustained growth. India is the third-largest economy in the world in PPP terms and the fifthlargest in market exchange rates. As expected of a nation of this size, the Indian economy in FY23 has nearly 'recouped' what was lost, 'renewed' what had paused, and 're-energised' what had slowed during the pandemic and since the conflict in Europe.
