# Monetary Developments

## MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS

- 2.5 Monetary policy plays a crucial role in determining the economic conditions of a country through its influence on macroeconomic indicators such as economic growth, inflation, and investments.  The  primary  objective  of  monetary  policy  is  to  maintain  price  stability  while keeping in mind the objective of growth. Various instruments of monetary policy, viz. cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) of banks, open market operations of the Central Bank, and imposition of credit ceilings, etc., are used by the central bank in the direction of this overall objective. This section of the chapter presents the recent monetary developments in the economy, focussing on the emerging liquidity conditions and monetary policy transmission in terms of lending and deposit rates of banks.

## Monetary and Credit Conditions

- 2.6 Monetary and credit conditions evolved in line with the monetary policy stance during the  year,  supporting  domestic  economic  activity.  The  Monetary  Policy  Committee  (MPC) maintained  the  status  quo  on  the  policy  repo  rate  at  6.5  per  cent  in  FY24.  It  focused  on withdrawing accommodation to ensure that inflation gradually aligns with the target while supporting  growth.  With  the  cumulative  policy  repo  rate  hike  of  250  basis  points  (bps), undertaken between May 2022 and February 2023, working its way through the economy, the MPC kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent since February 2023, but with readiness to undertake appropriate and timely policy actions if the situation so warrants.
- 2.7 Important  factors  impacting  the  evolution  of  monetary  and  credit  conditions  during FY24 were the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes (May 2023) 2 , the merger of HDFC, a non-bank with HDFC Bank (July 2023), and the temporary imposition of the incremental CRR (I-CRR) (August 2023). The expansion in reserve money and currency in circulation (CiC) moderated due to the return of a predominant part of ₹2,000 banknotes to the banking system as deposits. As per the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the total value of ₹2,000 banknotes in circulation has declined from ₹3.56 lakh crore as of 19 May 2023 (when the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes was announced) to ₹7,581 crore as of 28 June 2024, indicating that 97.87 per cent of the ₹2,000 denomination banknotes have returned to the banking system. 3  This and an increase in term deposit rates contributed to an acceleration in aggregate deposits and broad money (M3). The growth in CiC moderated to 4.1 per cent from 7.8 per cent YoY in the last year, reflecting the impact of the withdrawal of ₹2,000 banknotes.
- 2.8 Reserve Money (M0) recorded a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 6.7 per cent as of 29 March 2024, compared to 9.7 per cent in the previous year. M0, adjusted for the first-round impact of

changes in the CRR, recorded a 6.7 per cent growth compared with 7.4 per cent a year ago. The increase in M0 was mainly driven by net foreign assets (NFA) during FY24.

2.9 The growth in Broad Money (M3), excluding the impact of the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank (with effect from 1 July 2023), was 11.2 per cent (YoY) as of 22 March 2024, compared to 9 per cent a year ago. On the components side 4 , aggregate deposits (AD), the most significant component, contributed most to the expansion of M3. Amongst sources, bank credit to the commercial sector significantly contributed to the increase in M3, with a share of 67.1 per cent as of 22 March 2024, supplemented by net bank credit to the Government. (share of 29.4 per cent) 5

2.10 As  of  22  March  2024,  the  Money  Multiplier  (MM)  was  5.4  against  5.2  a  year  ago. Adjusted for reverse repo amounts, analytically akin to banks' deposits with the Central Bank, the adjusted MM was marginally lower at 5.3 as of March 2024. 6

## Liquidity conditions and trends in policy rates

2.11 The RBI's liquidity management involved two-way operations in response to shifts in liquidity conditions. During FY24, 17 fortnightly Variable Rate Reverse Repo (VRRR) auctions and seven Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions were undertaken as the primary operation. In addition, 49 fine-tuning operations (25 VRRR and 24 VRR) were conducted intermittently, modulating liquidity conditions in alignment with the monetary policy stance. Amidst tightened liquidity conditions, banks also took recourse to the marginal standing facility (MSF). Given the  extensive  deployment  of  surplus  funds  under  the  standing  deposit  facility  (SDF)  and simultaneous recourse to the MSF, reversal of liquidity facilities under both the SDF and the MSF was allowed even during weekends and holidays, effective 30 December 2023. 7

2.12 Taking cognisance of risks that excess liquidity can pose to price and financial stability and the increase in the surplus liquidity, inter-alia, due to the return of ₹2,000 banknotes to the banking system, the RBI announced a temporary I-CRR of 10 per cent on 10 August 2023 8 . The I-CRR, which impounded about ₹1.1 lakh crore from the banking system, was reviewed on  8  September  2023  and  discontinued  in  a  phased  manner,  ending  7  October  2023.  The impounded amount was thus released to the banking system ahead of the festival season in line with the announcement on the Developmental and Regulatory Policies of 10 August 2023. As a result of these actions, the banking system's liquidity moderated, becoming a deficit in midSeptember, which persisted during FY24.

6  Money Multiplier (MM) refers to the amount of M3 a bank generates with each rupee of M0 available to them. It depicts the relationship between the monetary base and the economy's money supply, indicating how fast the money supply will grow from the bank's lending activity. Higher the value of the MM, the higher the liquidity in the market and vice versa.

7    This measure will be reviewed after six months or earlier if needed.

Moderation in liquidity conditions

## Monetary policy transmission

2.13 Lending  and  deposit  rates  of  scheduled  commercial  banks  (SCBs)  increased  further during FY24, reflecting the lagged impact of the policy rate hikes during May 2022-February 2023, the external benchmark-based lending rate system of loan pricing and the moderation of  surplus  liquidity.  During  the  current  tightening  cycle,  i.e.,  from  May  2022  to  May  2024, the external benchmark-based lending rate and the one-year median marginal-cost-of-fundsbased lending rate increased by 250 bps and 175 bps, respectively. The transmission of hike in policy rates to lending and deposit rates is given in Table II.1.
