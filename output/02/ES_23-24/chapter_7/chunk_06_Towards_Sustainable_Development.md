## TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

7.115  With  less  than  six  years  remaining  for  achieving  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals (SDGs),  the  Government  of  India  has  been  at  the  forefront  in  embracing,  adopting,  and championing the SDGs to improve the welfare and quality of life for its citizens. Despite the global economy facing multiple headwinds, India has made steady progress towards achieving the 2030 Agenda, showcasing the nation's resilience and commitment to SDGs. According to the progress report on SDGs by NITI Aayog through the SDG India Index, India has significantly improved  in  meeting  these  goals  despite  global  challenges.  Targeted  interventions  such  as Pradhan  Mantri  Awas  Yojana,  Ujjwala  Yojana,  Swachh  Bharat  Abhiyan,  Jan  Dhan  Yojana, Ayushman Bharat-PMJAY,  Ayushman  Arogya  Mandir,  PM-Mudra  Yojana,  Saubhagya,  and Start-up India have had significant impacts and led to rapid improvements.

7.116  India's  progress  in  achieving  SDGs has advanced with each year. The performance is measured for 16 quantifiable goals, and a qualitative assessment is provided for Goal 17. The country's overall score/composite score 181  measured by the SDG India Index has ascended from 57 in 2018 to 60 in 2019-20, 66 in 2020-21 to 71 in 2023-24. India has taken significant strides in accelerating progress on the SDGs between the 2020-21 and 2023-24 editions of the Index.

7.117  Since 2018, India has witnessed substantial progress in several key SDGs. Significant progress has been made in Goals 1 (No Poverty), 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure) and 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) (Chart VII.15).
