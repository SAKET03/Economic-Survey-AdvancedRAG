## INTRODUCTION

7.1 India is on the path to scaling the next level of the development ladder to a ' Developed India' step by 2047 (ViksitBharat@2047). Economic growth is a pathway to achieve the end goal  of  development  comprising  economic, social,  technological,  and  institutional  progress. However,  the  direction  of  public  policy  and  its  implementation  are  also  instrumental  in translating growth to across-the-board human development. Home to 18 per cent of humanity 1 , India's  social  infrastructure  must  reach  a  diverse  and  expansive  populace,  transcending cultures, languages, and geographies. Boasting a young and aspirational society, India aims to seize the opportunities provided by steady and high economic growth while also ensuring a  society  characterised  by  better  health  care,  education,  clean  water,  sanitation  facilities, affordable housing, electricity, and the internet. A vast amount of ground has been covered to ensure sustainable and equitable economic growth and the journey continues with challenges, old and new, as well as solutions, centralised and local.

7.2 Over the last decade, the Indian concept of welfare has been significantly transformed into a more long-term-oriented, efficient, and empowering avatar. This has further strengthened the welfare ecosystem and helped lay a solid foundation for human development in the country.

Besides, the Government's social sector expenditure has been keeping pace with the sector's growing importance. The Government's spending on social services has shown a rising trend since FY16, with a focus on many aspects of the social well-being of citizens of the country, as evident from Table VII.1. Between FY18 and FY24, nominal GDP has grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 9.5 per cent. Overall, welfare expenditure has grown at a CAGR of 12.8 per cent. Expenditure on education has grown at a CAGR of 9.4 per cent- a tad below the rate of nominal GDP growth. Expenditure on health, as shown in the Table below, has grown at a CAGR of 15.8 per cent.
