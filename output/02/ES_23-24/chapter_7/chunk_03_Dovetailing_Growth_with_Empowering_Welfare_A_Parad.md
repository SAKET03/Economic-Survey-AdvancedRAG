# Dovetailing Growth with Empowering Welfare: A Paradigm Shift

## DOVETAILING GROWTH WITH EMPOWERING WELFARE: A PARADIGM SHIFT

7.4 Demchok village in Leh, located at a height of 13,800 feet where mercury can drop up to minus 40 degrees, got its first tap water connection in July 2022 under the Jal Jeevan Mission, freeing up women from the drudgery of fetching water. A remote tribal village of Bulumgavan in Maharashtra received electric supply only in 2018, 70 years after independence!

7.5 There  are  numerous  such  stories  of  the  common  citizens  reaping  the  harvest  of  the Government's empowering approach to welfare. With India becoming the fifth largest economy,

the lives of average Indians are better than a decade ago. Over 10.3 crore women have been provided free-of-cost gas connections under PM Ujjwala Yojana, 11.7 crore toilets have been built  under Swachh Bharat Mission, 52.6 crore Jan Dhan accounts have been opened, 3.47 crore pucca houses have been built for the poor people under the PM-AWAS Yojana, 11.7 crore households provided tap water connections under Jal Jeevan Mission, and 6.9 crore hospital admissions have been made under the Ayushman Bharat Scheme. Behind these numbers lie numerous stories of better lives.

7.6 India's social and economic milieu presents many strengths, opportunities, and challenges. Its  strengths can be counted as the fastest-growing economy, which is making great strides in  delivering welfare and opportunities to its people through the creation and expansion of digital public infrastructure (DPI). The opportunities are reflected in the fact that 18 per cent of the population is in the age group of 15-24 years (compared to the global average of 15.4 per cent), with a median age of 28.2 years. 5  This young India wants to climb the ladder of social and  financial  progress  faster.  These  strengths  and  opportunities  are  also  counter-balanced by  significant  challenges,  including  improving  learning  outcomes  in  schools,  eliminating malnutrition, channelising the potential of the hinterland, tackling regional, caste and gender disparities, and instilling accountability and transparency at all levels of the Government. In light of limited fiscal resources, the expectations of the socio-economically diverse populace necessitate a sensitive, pragmatic, and prudent welfare policy.

7.7 This required transforming  the  approach  to  a  long-term-oriented,  efficient,  and empowering  one,  recognising  universal  access  to  basic  amenities  as  a  starter  for  inclusive growth,  thus  impelling  an  array  of  flagship  initiatives.  In  contrast  to  short-term  measures requiring repeated disbursement of scarce resources, such an approach not only builds social infrastructure for the decades to come but also enables individuals to climb up the standardof-living ladder and utilise the opportunities accompanying high growth. Socially empowering the citizens inculcates a sense of autonomy and self-confidence by altering social relationships, institutions, and discourses so that the hitherto excluded disadvantaged sections of society can also find a place in the sun. Placing people on the 'development' treadmill from the 'welfare' treadmill  is  not  just  a  matter  of  fiscal  sustainability.  Self-esteem  and  personal  dignity  also stand enhanced when members of the public participate in and contribute to development, moving away from welfare dependence. As Rama Bijapurkar notes, even among the socially disadvantaged, 'there is a distinct and growing segment who, with some combination of access to networks, information, Government support, and personal circumstances, find the agency and energy to try and strive for opportunities for a better life.' 6

## Pillars of the new approach to welfare

7.8 The new welfare approach bears in mind that spending alone cannot guarantee outcomes. It  lays a strong focus on transforming the implementation and effectiveness of Government programmes, thus increasing the impact per rupee spent. Cost-effectiveness is increasingly

6    'The new tale of two Indias', Business Standard, 25 June 2024 https://tinyurl.com/35p9ukf8

being pointed out in academic literature, too. For instance, Muralidharan (2024) 7  estimates that unless the efficiency of converting spending into outcomes is substantially improved, neither a growth focus nor a development focus (i.e., increasing budget allocation to social sectors) will  lead  to  satisfactory  outcomes  in  tackling  child  stunting,  improving  learning  in  schools, reducing the infant mortality rate. To this end, the Government is emphasising process reforms and accountability, interwoven with the utilisation of technology.

- 7.9 The digitisation of healthcare, education and governance has been a force multiplier for every rupee spent on a welfare programme. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme and Jan Dhan Yojana-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity have been boosters of fiscal efficiency and minimisation of leakages, with more than â‚¹38 lakh crore having been transferred via DBT since its inception in 2013. 8

7.10  The Government has also implemented a goal-oriented approach for budgetary allocation, comprising expected outputs and outcomes of the schemes, as part of the Outcome Budget, which has been accompanying the conventional annual Budget since FY 18. An 'Output-Outcome Monitoring Framework' has been developed by NITI Aayog for the major central sector and centrally sponsored schemes since FY 20. Moreover, acceleration in capital expenditure within social services expenditure signifies higher productivity and creation of societal assets. This is set against the backdrop of ubiquitous, user-friendly dashboards and management information systems (MIS) across major schemes, instilling transparency and accountability through realtime monitoring. Box VII.1 delves deeper into the rising heft of data in governance.

## Box VII.1: Transforming data governance in India: DGQI 2.0 and beyond

Over the past few decades, the Government of India has made significant strides in managing and  utilising  data  effectively.  Recent  decades  have  witnessed  a  digital  transformation, with  MIS and centralised data access through policies like the National Data Sharing &amp; Accessibility  Policy  and  data.gov.in.  Dashboard  systems  and  platforms  like  District Development  Coordination  and  Monitoring  Committees  (DISHA),  Prayas,  and  Output Outcome Monitoring Framework have improved accountability in public policy.

Today, most Government programmes utilise internal MIS that capture vast amounts of data. In today's digital age, effectively managing this data, extracting actionable insights for  decision-making,  facilitating  course  corrections,  and  ensuring  interoperability  across Government data units are critical objectives of India's data strategy towards a Viksit Bharat . It would bolster data availability for decision-making and foster system interoperability for a seamless experience for beneficiaries accessing Government services.

In this context, a comprehensive review of present data preparedness levels of all Ministries/ Departments  (M/D)  was  required  to  chart  the  way  forward  and  suggest  measures  for improvement. Against this background, the Data Governance Quality Index (DGQI) exercise was initiated to assess the data preparedness of various M/D on a standardised framework to drive healthy competition among them and promote cooperative peer learning from best practices.

The  exercise  is  conducted  periodically,  where  the  Ministries  are  requested  to  fill  out responses to a standard questionnaire on the DGQI dashboard. The exercise culminates in a report that includes rankings of all M/Ds and their schemes, providing analytical insights for further improvement and learning. The index has progressed from an average score 9 of 2.29/5 in the 1st Round in 2020 to 3.95/5 in the latest Round, i.e., Round 6 in 2024, comprising around 75 M/Ds and 567 interventions/schemes.

It  is  hoped  that  in  the  long  run,  DGQI  will  help  in  laying  the  foundation  of  robust  data monitoring system of all the CS/ CSS schemes of all M/Ds, ultimately leading to a state-ofthe-art data-driven decision making.

7.11 The  approach  also  comprises  targeted  implementation  reforms  for  last-mile  service delivery  to  truly  realise  the  maxim  of  'no  person  left  behind.'  The  Aspirational  Districts Programme (ADP), following the 3C approach of 'Convergence' across levels of Government, 'Collaboration'  between  civil  society  and  Government,  and  'Competition'  among  states  and districts through a dashboard monitoring monthly progress led to substantial improvement in  several  indicators  such  as  health  and  nutrition,  education,  and  reporting  saturation  in the  basic  infrastructure  such  as  electricity  connections,  all-weather  roads,  basic  sanitation facilities, etc. An appraisal of the programme by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) concluded that the programme has resulted in sectoral growth and improvements in governance and administration. 10 Box VII.2 presents two success stories of the ADP. Other targeted  programmes  include  the  Aspirational  Blocks  Programme,  launched  in  2023,  the Vibrant Villages Programme for border areas, and more recently, the Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra, which saw participation of 15 crore people in two months starting 15 November 2023, are other examples of going the extra mile for saturation of various Government schemes.

9    Based on the constituents' weightage, the DGQI score lies between 0 (lowest) to 5 (highest).

## Box VII.2: Baramulla and Gumla progress from 'Aspiration' to 'Transformation'

Baramulla, Jammu and Kashmir and Gumla, Jharkhand, won the prestigious PM Awards for  excellence  in  Public  Administration  2022 under the ADP category. The initiatives in Gumla and Baramulla showcase the transformative impact of targeted interventions under the ADP, significantly improving health and education outcomes.

Baramulla addressed its challenging topography and harsh weather by establishing birth waiting  wards  in  Uri  and  Boniyar,  benefiting  20,000  pregnant  women.  Severe  acute malnutrition and moderate acute malnutrition rates declined to near-zero levels through monitoring  with  Poshan  tracker  tabs.  Educational  initiatives  included  18  lab  schools focusing  on  innovative  teaching  techniques  and  improving  learning  outcomes.  Hybrid learning  and  ICT  tools  prepared  students  for  competitive  exams.  Other  efforts  included crop diversification, mushroom cultivation, organic farming, and dairy units. Governance measures involved digital gap analysis, biometric attendance, and an Innovation Cell for academics.

Gumla tackled anaemia and malnutrition by promoting the cultivation of Ragi, empowering women  in  Self-Help  Groups  (SHGs)  through  livelihood  opportunities.  This  initiative addressed  the  district's  challenges  of  low  income,  poor  productivity,  and  lack  of  critical infrastructure.  Tribal  women  handled  Ragi's  procurement,  processing,  packaging,  and marketing. Governance initiatives included an open-door policy for public grievances, regular meetings,  and  optimal  fund  allocation.  The  innovative  Ragi  Mission  broke  the  stagnant monocropping practice by expanding the ragi cultivated area by 3500 acres, resulting in a 219 per cent increase in production in FY22. Solar-based lift and drip irrigation systems covering more than 4349 acres ensure all-year round agricultural practice in the region.

7.12 This transformed approach to welfare further encompassed prioritising social enablers. Accordingly, stress was placed on investments in health and sanitation. For example, child immunisation  under  Mission  Indradhanush  and  sanitation  through  programmes  like  ODF and ODF plus and Swachh Bharat Mission have led to lesser disease incidence due to cleaner practices, lesser school absenteeism due to illness, and more effective nutrient absorption over the long run among the least privileged. According to the fifth National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), the percentage of children aged 12-23 months who are fully vaccinated increased from 77.9 per cent in 2015-16 to 83.8 per cent during 2019-21.

7.13 Another  policy  of  the  Government,  given  the  country's  demography  and  occupation profile,  has  been  to  provide  affordable  social  security  schemes  for  the  unorganised  sector workers. The Atal Pension Yojana (APY), PM Jeevan Jyoti Yojana (PMJJY), and PM Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) (all three launched in 2015) are success stories of an expanding social safety net equipped with universal bank account penetration. While PM-JJY and PM-SBY were the first of their kind, the APY improved remarkably upon its predecessor, the Swavalamban Yojana.

7.14 The approach to welfare is wholesome and whole-of-society, with increasing private sector participation through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). In 2014, spending by companies on social purpose programmes was made mandatory through a new provision under Section 135 of the Companies Act 2013. 11  The trend of CSR spending post-2014 is presented in Box VII.3. With the robust growth of the economy, corporate profits in India and, hence, the mandatory CSR pool will continue to grow, powering the sustainable and inclusive development that nonprofits are uniquely positioned to accelerate with their last-mile presence on the ground.

## Box VII.3: Corporate Social Responsibility - Building bridges between profit and purpose

Some trends in the extent of CSR activities as per the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)'s data are presented below.

- (a)    In  the  eight  years  from  2014  to  2022,  â‚¹1.53  lakh  crore  were  spent  on  CSR,  and  the spending across the last three years constitutes more than 50 per cent of the total CSR amount spent since 2014. CSR compliance has seen a growing adherence over the years, with more than half the companies even going beyond their obligation. For the last three years, yearly CSR spending has been more than â‚¹25 thousand crore, with yearly CSR spending increasing by 1.5 times in eight years. 12

11 The legal mandate on CSR applies to companies that have a net worth of â‚¹500 crore or more, or annual turnover of â‚¹1000 crore or more, or net profit of â‚¹5 crore or more. Companies coming under CSR mandate are required to spend 2 per cent of their average net profit of the preceding three financial years on social impact Programmes that focus on any of the causes listed in the Schedule VII of the Companies Act, 2013.

- (b)    Public  sector units, while constituting about 2 per cent of the companies under CSR mandate, contribute to almost 17 per cent of the total CSR amount.
- (c)    Sector-wise, more than three-fourths of total CSR spend is in the top four development sectors, i.e., Education (32.4 per cent), Healthcare &amp; Sanitation (38.4 per cent), Rural Development (6.9 per cent), and Environment, Animal Welfare &amp; Conservation (10.9 per cent).
- (d)    About  half  of  the  implementation  of  CSR  funds  happens  in  partnership  with  nonprofit organisations. This implementation model adopted by companies has provided an excellent boost to the non-profit ecosystem in the country besides enabling crosspollination of ideas across sectors. While non-profits learn analytical and process-based rigour from partner companies, the latter have benefitted from community engagement and inclusive outlook as the corporate citizens of the society.
- (e)    The distribution of CSR investment is primarily centred around the hubs of corporate headquarters in the country, while underdeveloped areas remain relatively less funded. For regionally-balanced CSR spending, there is a need for enhanced investment in the organisational growth and capacity building of the non-profit organisations working in underdeveloped areas.

## Overall Progress and Outcomes

## Improvements in multidimensional poverty

7.15 Focusing solely on income is not enough to capture the actual reality of poverty, as it may conceal the exact deprivations experienced by millions of individuals every day. Here, the measurement of multidimensional poverty is valuable to gauge the incidence and intensity of poverty as it is lived by revealing who is poor and the different disadvantages they experience.

7.16  The National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) has been estimated for India by NITI Aayog, which is in line with the global MPI 13  published by the UNDP, with a few customisations for  the  Indian  context. 14 The  MPI  estimated  by  the  Niti  Ayog  has  three  equally  weighted dimensions: health, education, and standard of living, split across 12 weighted indicators. These deprivations are very basic and, hence, emblematic of real poverty, in addition to informing policymakers of the necessities lacking in the country. 15

7.17 While  the  headcount  ratio  measures  the  spread  of  multidimensional  poverty,  the deprivation  score  measures  the  intensity  of  multidimensional  poverty  (i.e.,  the  number  of deprivations experienced by a poor person). A weighted deprivation score of 0.33 is required for  a  household  to  qualify  as  MPI-poor.  The  MPI  index  is  thus  obtained  as  the  product  of headcount ratio (HCR) and intensity.

## India's Progress in MPI: 2019-21 vs. 2015-16

7.18  There has been a sharp decline in the HCR accompanied by a decrease in the intensity of poverty, with the MPI nearly halving from 0.117 in 2015-16 to 0.066 in 2019-21, thereby setting India on the path of achieving the SDG Target 1.2 (of reducing multidimensional poverty by at least half) much ahead of the stipulated timeline of 2030. Resultantly, 13.5 crore Indians are estimated to have escaped multidimensional poverty between 2015-16 and 2019-21. This decline  is  driven  by  declining  deprivations  in  nutrition,  years  of  schooling,  sanitation,  and cooking fuel, attributable to large-scale policy attention. Region-wise, this trend is driven by rural India, with the most significant improvements occurring in states like Bihar, MP, UP, Odisha, and Rajasthan. Uttar Pradesh registered the most significant decline in the number of poor people, with 3.43 crore people escaping multidimensional poverty. Notably, the number of States with less than 10 per cent of people living in multidimensional poverty doubled from 7 in 2016 to 14 in 2021.

14    https://www.niti.gov.in/index.php/whats-new/national-multidimentional-poverty-index-2023

15    The  Alkire-Foster  methodology  has  been  adopted  to  develop  this  index.  It  has  many  axiomatic  advantages such as monotonicity, scale and replication invariance, symmetry, poverty, and deprivation focus, etc., making it  a  globally  accepted methodology. This is largely same as Global MPI by UNDP &amp; OPHI, with 2 additional indicators, i.e., maternal health and bank account, using the data from the NFHS.

7.19 NITI  Aayog's  discussion  paper,  'Multidimensional  Poverty  in  India  since  2005-06', 16 finds that 24.82 crore people have escaped multidimensional poverty between 2013-14 and 2022-23.  To  assess  the  poverty  levels  in  2013-14  and  2022-23,  projected  estimates  based on the compounded annual rate of change have been used due to data limitations for these specific periods. According to the NITI's paper, India has registered a significant decline in the proportion of individuals in multidimensional poverty in India from 29.17 per cent in 2013-14 to 11.28 per cent in 2022-23, i.e. a reduction of 17.89 percentage points.

7.20  The paper also highlights that UP registered the largest decline in the number of poor, with 5.94 crore people escaping multidimensional poverty during the last nine years, followed by Bihar at 3.77 crore, MP at 2.30 crore and Rajasthan at 1.87 crore. Overall, the decline in poverty HCR was much faster between 2015-16 and 2019-21 (10.66 per cent annual rate of decrease) than from 2005-06 to 2015-16 (7.69 per cent annual rate of decline).

## Household Consumption Expenditure Survey 2022-23

7.21 The  results  of  various  initiatives  in  the  social  sector  have  translated  into  reduced inequality and rising consumption spending, as evident from the results of the latest Household Consumption  Expenditure  Survey  (HCES)  2022-23  (conducted  from  August  2022  to  July 2023), released on 24 February 2024. 17  The results provide insights into the monetary aspect of living standards across rural and urban areas, estimated as the monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE). The results broadly confirm the substantial rise in non-income aspects of living standards noted previously in the multidimensional poverty report of the NITI Aayog.

7.22  The HCES offers many reassuring findings on inclusive growth in the past decade. The MPCE in 2022-23 increased in real terms by 40 per cent in rural and 33.5 per cent in urban areas over 2011-12. The Gini coefficient, an indicator of inequality, has declined from 0.283 to 0.266 for the rural sector and from 0.363 to 0.314 for the urban sector of the country. The rural-urban divide has also declined considerably, as the difference between rural and urban MPCE declined from 83.9 per cent in 2011-12 to 71.2 per cent in 2022-23. Within rural and urban areas, the consumption of the lowest 5 per cent of the MPCE population grew faster than the top 5 per cent, indicating a decline in economic inequality over the last decade. Imputation of  free-of-cost  items  provided  through  various  Government  programmes  leads  to  a  further progressive rise in MPCE, with the benefit of welfare schemes as a proportion of MPCE at 0.8 per cent for the top 5 per cent fractile and 5.0 per cent for the bottom 5 per cent fractile in rural areas (for urban areas, the corresponding figures were 0.1 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively). Juxtaposing the MPCE numbers with the per capita gross national income (PCI) reveals an inclusive trend in economic growth, where the MPCE/PCI ratio has increased for all consumption classes except the top 5 per cent in rural India and the top 10 per cent in urban India. Notably, this progress occurred despite the once-in-a-century crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Quality Healthcare for All

7.23  For  a  resilient  economy,  the  health  sector  is  vital.  A  sound  healthcare  system  is interconnected with long-term factors responsible for inclusive growth, such as ensuring the quality  of  human  capital  and  labour  productivity,  higher  household  savings,  avoiding  the poverty trap due to catastrophic health expenditure, and building the capability to withstand any health shocks such as COVID-19. In that spirit, the Indian health system has been consistently revamped.

7.24  The Government is committed to ensuring sound health and well-being of all ages through a preventive and promotive healthcare orientation in all developmental policies and universal access to good quality healthcare services. To this end, the Government is implementing various schemes and programmes. Key initiatives and their progress are listed in Table VII.2.

## Minding the Mind: Taking stock of the mental health scenario

7.25  Mental health is a less seen yet principally impactful driver of individual and national development. Way back in 1954, Dr. Brock Chisholm, the first Director-General of the World Health  Organization  (WHO),  famously  said,  'Without  mental  health,  there  can  be  no  true physical health.'

7.26  Mental  well-being  is  intertwined  with  all  aspects  of  health,  viz.  physical,  social,  and emotional, and can be described as a state of well-being in which a person is able to cope with the stresses of daily life, continue to be productive and contribute to the community. Mental health  conditions  include  mental  disorders  and  psychosocial  disabilities,  as  well  as  mental states associated with significant distress, impairment in functioning or risk of self-harm. From minor stressors to severe disorders, mental health concerns can have an impact throughout an individual's lifetime.

## Rising prevalence of mental health issues

7.27  As per WHO, in 2019 22 , one in every eight people, or 970 million people globally, were living with a mental disorder 23 , with anxiety and depression being the most common conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a 27.6 per cent increase in cases of major depressive disorders and a 25.6 per cent increase in cases of anxiety disorders in 2020 globally. 24  According to a large-scale  study  co-led  by  researchers  from  Harvard  Medical  School  and  the  University  of Queensland, one out of every two people in the world will develop a mental health disorder in their lifetime (McGrath et al., 2023). 25

7.28  In the Indian context, the National Mental Health Survey (NMHS) 2015-16 26  showed that 10.6 per cent adults suffered from mental disorders in India while treatment gap for mental disorders ranged between 70 to 92 per cent for different disorders. Further, as per the survey, the prevalence of mental morbidity was higher in urban metro regions (13.5 per cent) as compared

23    According to WHO, a mental disorder is characterized by a clinically significant disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotional regulation, or behaviour.

to rural areas (6.9 per cent) and urban non-metro areas (4.3 per cent). The second and more expansive NMHS is currently in progress. According to Dhyani et al. (2022), individuals aged 25-44 years are the most affected by mental illnesses. 27

## Evolving Mental Health of Children and Youth

7.29  Sound  mental  health  of  children  and  adolescents  is  the  foundation  of  their  holistic development  and  a  critical  step  towards  ensuring  quality  economic  growth.  This  assumes urgency  in  the  wake  of  rising  prevalence  of  mental  health  issues  in  youth,  attributable  to academic pressures, social media, family dynamics, and socio-economic environment. Globally, one in seven 10-19-year-olds experience a mental disorder (WHO 2021). 28  According to research carried out by Gallup for UNICEF's Changing Childhood report, a median of 19 per cent of 15 to 24-year-olds in 21 countries self-reported in the first half of 2021 that they often feel depressed or have little interest in doing things. 29

7.30  In India, NCERT's Mental Health and Well-being of School Students Survey 30  showed an increasing prevalence of poor mental health among adolescents, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, with 11 per cent of students reported as feeling anxious, 14 per cent as feeling extreme emotion and 43 per cent experienced mood swings. 50 per cent of students cited studies as a reason for anxiety, and 31 per cent cited examination and results.

7.31 The increase in mental health issues in children and adolescents is often linked to the overuse of the internet and, specifically, social media. Unrestrained and unsupervised use of the internet by children can culminate into a range of problems, from the more prevalent obsessive consumption  of  social  media  or  'doom  scrolling' 31 to  severe  ones  such  as  cyberbullying. 32 Jonathan Haidt, a famous American social psychologist and author, explores the impact of increased screen time and reduced free play on mental health issues among young people in his book 'The Anxious Generation: How the great rewiring of children is causing an epidemic of mental illness'. Discussing the impact of social media, overprotective parenting, and the decline of unsupervised outdoor play on children's emotional well-being, the book suggests that the epidemic of mental health issues hit the world in the early 2010s with the advent of mobile phones. This 'great rewiring of childhood' has interfered with children's social and neurological development, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, loneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism.

32    Cyberbullying is considered to be a serious public health issue, closely related to an adolescent's mental health and development. Those bullied online show severe symptoms of depression, anxiety and loneliness. Self-esteem issues  and  absenteeism  from  school.  See  Zhu,  C.,  Huang,  S.,  Evans,  R.,  &amp;  Zhang,  W.

7.32  Vivek Murthy, the U.S. Surgeon General, talks about social media being akin to tobacco and suggests  warning  labels  on  the  tech  platforms,  arguing  that  they  are  fuelling  a  mental health crisis among teenagers. He goes on to make a case for laws to shield the young from online harassment, abuse, and exploitation. 33  Recently, the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education voted to prohibit smartphones for its 429,000 students in a bid to shield them from distractions, social media, and detrimental effects on learning and mental health. 34 In the Indian context, the rising usage of the Internet on mental health has been indicated by a 2021 study on 'Effects of using Mobile Phones and other devices with Internet accessibility by children' by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights, according to which 23.8 per cent of children use smartphones while they are in bed, and 37.2 per cent of children experience reduced levels of concentration due to smartphone use. 35

## Mental Health Issues through the lens of Economics

7.33  Mental  health  problems  affect  the  quality  of  life  of  an  individual  and  constrain  the realisation of an individual's potential. At an aggregate economic level, mental health disorders are associated with significant productivity losses due to absenteeism, decreased productivity, disability,  increased  healthcare  costs,  etc. 36   Apart  from  mental  health  impacting  economic development, there is also evidence of poverty affecting the risk of mental health via stressful living conditions, financial instability, and a lack of opportunities for upward mobility, which contribute to heightened psychological distress. 37  Moreover, rising urbanisation and migration can  disrupt  social  cohesion,  traditional  support  systems,  and  stability,  causing  significant mental stress (Trivedi, Sareen, and Dhyani 2008). 38

7.34  Given the impact of mental health on growth, the returns on investment in the former are  also  high.  According  to  a  2016  study  across  36  countries,  the  benefit-to-cost  ratio  of substantially scaled-up treatment of depression and anxiety in 2016-30 was estimated as 2.33.0 to 1 considering economic benefits only, and 3.3-5.7 to 1 when the value of health returns is  also  included (Chisholm et al. 2016). 39 In  the  Indian context, Math et al. (2019) estimate the return on investment in the implementation of the Mental Health Care Act 2017 by the Government to be 6.5 times. 40

## Positive policy momentum provides tailwinds for action

7.35  India is creating positive momentum in policy development by recognising mental health as  a  fundamental  aspect  of  overall  well-being.  The  Government  is  implementing  national policies such as the National Mental Health Policy (2014), the National Youth Policy (2014) and the National Education Policy (2020), emphasising the importance of mental health across the

7.36  In addition to national initiatives, states are implementing unique, independent initiatives at  the  state  level.  For  instance,  the  State  Mental  Health  Policy  of  Meghalaya  outlines  plans to train the Community Health Centre (CHC) and school staff to provide targeted support to children and adolescents. The Government of the NCT of Delhi has introduced a Happiness Curriculum for students from Nursery to Grade 8, integrating mindfulness, meditation, and values-based  education  into  the  school  curriculum.  Similarly,  the  'Our  Responsibility  to Children' initiative launched in Kozhikode, Kerala, includes teacher, peer, and social mentoring, life skills education, and professional care and support for children with special needs within schools. These state-level initiatives complement national efforts in addressing mental health and well-being among children and adolescents.

## Policy Recommendations on Mental Health

7.37  While most of the policy design is in place, proper implementation can accelerate the improvement on the ground. That said, there remain certain gaps in the existing programmes which need to be addressed to maximise their effectiveness. For instance, redoubling efforts to increase the number of psychiatrists, from 0.75 psychiatrists per lakh population in 2021 43  to the WHO norm of 3 per lakh population (Garg, Kumar and Chandra 2019). 44

7.38  Developing  comprehensive  guidelines  for  the  excellence  centres'  services  alongside mental healthcare professionals and users would help understand their needs. Also, assessing the effectiveness of the programmes by gathering feedback from the users, professionals, and stakeholders  will  help  make  necessary  changes  and  meet  the  needs  of  a  wider  population. Nurturing  peer  support  networks,  self-help  groups,  and  community-based  rehabilitation programmes can help destigmatisation of mental disorders and develop a sense of belonging. Partnering with NGOs to scale up efforts, share knowledge, and leverage resources to enhance future policies will also aid in identifying areas of improvement. Involving individuals with personal  experience  with  mental  health  problems  in  decision-making,  service  planning, and  advocacy  efforts  can  increase  the  person-centricity  and  recovery  orientation  of  mental healthcare services (Megharajani et al. 2023). 45 Sensitisation of mental health at the preschool, Anganwadi  level  can  provide  precious  early  identification  of  disorders.  The  rise  in  mental health start-ups signals a positive response from the private sector to address the care gap but also calls for standardisation of guidelines for such services.

7.39  Effective  pathways  for  integrating  mental  health  interventions  in  schools  can  include developing an age-appropriate mental health curriculum for teachers and students, encouraging early intervention and positive language in schools, promoting community-level interactions, and balancing the role of technology.

7.40  However, the fundamental issue of the lack of awareness about mental health and the stigma surrounding it can render any sincerely crafted programme unfeasible. Hence, there is a need to bring about a paradigm shift and utilise a bottom-up, whole-of-community approach in addressing the topic of mental health. Breaking the stigma starts with taking cognisance of the natural human tendency to accept physical ailments and seeking treatment for the same while being in denial about mental health issues. To an extent, the denial is an outcome of fear about social attitudes and social acceptance after one 'comes out' with mental health issues.

Nonetheless, at an individual level too, there is a reluctance to see it as normal and address it. For public health officials, tackling mental health requires acknowledging and addressing this fundamental reluctance. Arguably, mental health issues drag down productivity more widely in the ecosystem than individuals' physical health issues. Hence, paying attention to mental health issues in society is both a health and an economic imperative.

## Impact manifest in health statistics

## National Health Accounts show rising role of public healthcare

7.41  Over the past few years, healthcare has become more affordable and accessible for the general public, as noted by the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates. 46  The latest NHA (for FY20) show an increase in the share of Government Health Expenditure (GHE) in the total GDP as well as the share of GHE in Total Health Expenditure (THE).

7.42  Over the years, health expenditure has tilted towards primary healthcare as a building block  of  the  overall  health  ecosystem.  Research  has  established  the  importance  of  primary health care as critical to improving health outcomes, preventing several primary and secondary disease conditions, and reducing morbidity and mortality at much lower costs, thus significantly reducing  the  need  for  secondary  and  tertiary  care. 47 Consequently,  the  share  of  primary healthcare expenditure has increased from 51.3 per cent of GHE in FY15 to 55.9 per cent of GHE in FY20. The share of primary and secondary care in the GHE rose from 73.2 per cent in FY15 to 85.5 per cent in FY20. On the other hand, the share of primary and secondary care in private health expenditure has declined from 83.0 per cent to 73.7 per cent during the same period, attributable to rising tertiary disease burden and utilisation of Government facilities for primary healthcare.

7.43  The  social  security  expenditure  on  health,  which  includes  the  social  health  insurance programme, Government-financed health insurance schemes, and medical reimbursements made to Government employees, has increased significantly from 5.7 per cent in FY15 to 9.3 per cent in FY20. The rising GHE and health-related social security expenditure go hand in hand with a decline in out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) as a percentage of THE between FY15 and FY20 (Chart VII.5(a)).

46    NHA  estimates  for  India  2019-20  is  the  seventh  consecutive  NHA  estimates  report  prepared  by  NHSRC, designated as National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat in 2014 by the Union Health Ministry. This was released in April 2023.

7.44  The  above  developments  have  been  accompanied  by  improvements  in  key  health indicators such as infant mortality rate (declining from 39 per 1000 live births in 2013 to 28 per 1000 live births in 2020) and maternal mortality rate (declining from 167 per lakh live births in 2014 to 97 per lakh live births in 2020).

7.45  As an example of lower healthcare cost burden on families, the impact of Ayushman Bharat deserves mention. According to the Health Ministry's estimates, the total cost of the treatment

would have been 1.5 - 2 times higher if the beneficiary had availed the same treatment on their own outside the ambit of AB PM-JAY. Upon incorporating this multiplier effect of low costs, the scheme corresponds to saving more than 1.25 lakh crore of OOPE for poor and deprived families (as of 12 January 2024). 48  Hence, besides shielding the populace from market vulnerabilities, Ayushman Bharat also protects the healthcare delivery system from micro-economic shocks.

7.46  Besides the direct impact on health indicators and OOPE, there exist various secondorder effects of health programmes. For instance, the Ayushman Bharat has been associated with better credit market outcomes, as detailed in Box VII.4.

## Box VII.4: Health insurance programmes and impact on credit market outcomes

Catastrophic, unforeseen health expenses can result in the impoverishment of individuals and families. It can force resource-poor individuals/households to forego treatment or resort to debt to undertake the treatment. Mitigating healthcare costs is anticipated to improve financial stability and loan repayment capacity.

A recent paper 49  investigates the influence of PMJAY, the world's largest publicly funded health insurance scheme, on credit market dynamics in India. Comparing border regions of states that did not implement the program with contiguous areas belonging to states that implemented the program within a difference-in-difference framework, it hypothesises that PMJAY's extensive coverage would lead to decreased financial strain due to healthcare costs, thus influencing credit behaviours like loan delinquency rates. The study employs a robust empirical strategy to isolate the effect of PMJAY from other factors. It utilises administrative data from a significant Indian credit bureau covering microfinance loan performance. The sample includes data on nearly 12 million loans across 636 districts in India.

## Main findings of the study

Impact on loan performance: PMJAY implementation has been found to correlate with a significant reduction in NPA rates in microfinance loans. The study notes that the NPA rate in PMJAY-implemented districts decreased by 3.7 to 4.0 percentage points compared to non-implemented regions. This represents a 34.6 per cent to 34.1 per cent reduction relative to the average NPA rates, an economically significant impact.

Impact  on  small  agricultural  loans :  A  similar  reduction  in  NPA  rates  was  observed  in eligible small agricultural loans, underscoring PMJAY's broad economic impact.

## Implications for policy and financial markets

Public  health  programmes  and  economic  stability: The  study  illuminates  the  broader economic impacts of public health insurance programmes. For emerging economies, where large segments of the population might lack access to health insurance, programmes like PMJAY can play a crucial role in enhancing economic stability.

Healthcare  policy  and  household  finance: These  findings  are  particularly  relevant  for countries considering similar health insurance schemes, highlighting the potential for such programmes to influence household financial behaviour positively.

## Conclusion

PMJAY's  implementation  has  markedly  improved  credit  market  outcomes  in  India, highlighting the interplay between health insurance and financial stability. This underscores the  potential  of  public  health  initiatives  to  create  significant  economic  benefits  beyond healthcare.

7.47  Looking forward, two trends would be decisive for the health and disease profile of the country  in  the  near  future.  Firstly,  the  Government  and  the  public  at  large  need  to  accord healthy eating and mental health the attention they deserve. For instance, as per NFHS data, 24.0 per cent of women and 22.9 per cent of men were overweight/obese in 2019-21, vis-Ã -vis 20.6 per cent and 18.9 per cent in 2015-16, respectively. In 50 years, the incidence of type-II diabetes has increased from less than 2 per cent in the 1970s to more than 20 per cent. 50  In cognisance of the rising obesity in India, public awareness of healthy eating is being promoted with dietary guidelines issued by the National Institute of Nutrition and the Indian Council of Medical Research. Secondly, public health being a state subject, state and local level governance remain pivotal for the national big-ticket programmes to reach the last mile through the 'path of least resistance'.

## Education

7.48  'Quality Education', enlisted as Goal 4 under UN SDGs (SDG4), aims to 'Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all' by 2030. The National Education Policy (NEP), launched in 2020 and presently in its fourth year of implementation, is a policy document that not only encompasses the SDG Goals on Education but also prepares the youth of India to take on the challenges and opportunities emerging from a knowledge-driven economy of the 21st century.

## School education

7.49  The school education system in India, with public and private schools, caters to around 26 crore students from various socio-economic backgrounds. The NEP 2020 seeks to provide all learners in the age group of 3-18 years with access to high-quality education to create an educational system that is rooted in Indian culture and has the potential to establish India as a global knowledge superpower.

7.50  The NEP seeks to revamp the universe of school education to generate better learning outcomes for all. The gravity of the emphasis on learning can be felt in the various reports highlighting  the  gap  between  class  standard  and  learning  level,  which  has  widened  since COVID. For instance, in comparison to the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2017, student

50    Mohan, V., Sudha, V., Shobana, S., Gayathri, R., Krishnaswamy, K. (2023): 'Are Unhealthy Diets Contributing to the Rapid Rise of Type 2 Diabetes in India?', The Journal of Nutrition, Volume 153, Issue 4, 2023, Pages 940948, ISSN 0022-3166

performance underwent a significant drop in NAS 2021. 51  Class 10 scores decreased by 13.4 per cent in Mathematics, 18.6 per cent in Science, and 9.1 per cent in Social Science, while Class 3 scores decreased by 3.9 per cent in Language, 4.7 per cent in Mathematics, and 4. 4 per cent in Environmental Studies.

7.51 Implementing Early Childhood Care and Education or ECCE (refer to Box VII.5 for a notable initiative  in  ECCE),  strengthening  foundational literacy  and numeracy, experiential learning, multilingual education, focusing on interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approaches,  holistic  assessment,  etc.,  are  the  major  recommendations  of  the  NEP  2020  to develop a new system that is in line with the inspirational goals of the 21st century.

## BOX VII.5: 'Poshan Bhi Padhai Bhi': Pre-schools network anchored in Anganwadis

In alignment with the guidelines of the NEP 2020, 'Poshan bhi Padhai bhi' (PBPB) was launched in May 2023. It is a path-breaking ECCE programme to help India develop the world's largest, universal, high-quality preschool network at Anganwadi Centres. For the first time, early stimulation for 0-3 years is being covered by a Government programme.

## About PBPB

Through the programme, every child would be provided with at least two hours of highquality  preschool  instruction  daily.  All  States  will  follow  the  national  ECCE  task  force recommendations for a play-based, activity-based learning pedagogy explicitly targeted at developmental milestones of 0-3-year-olds and 3-6-year-olds, including special support for Divyang children.

## Key features of PBPB

- Use of teaching-learning material, including visual aids (blackboard, posters, flashcards, activity books, etc), audio aids (radio) and audio-visual (videos, films), spatial material (drawing, painting, puzzles), etc.
- Mother tongue as primary teacher instruction medium
- Jan Andolan will involve communities in strengthening the foundations of the country's future generations.

## Strengthening the country-wide-web of Anganwadis

Close to 13.9 lakh operational Anganwadi centres across the country provide supplementary nutrition, early care and education to around eight crore beneficiary children under the age of 6 years, making it the largest public provisioning of such services globally. Considering global evidence that 85 per cent of brain development is achieved by the age of 6 years, the Anganwadi eco-system becomes a critical access point for building our children's base to secure their future.

51    NAS is a central Government-led large-scale assessment that provides a 'snapshot of what students know and can do' at the end of Grades 3, 5, 8 and 10. About 34 lakh students of 1.18 lakh schools in 720 districts from both rural and urban areas participated in NAS 2021. The national, state, and district Report Cards are available at nas.gov.in.

In order to realise PBPB through Anganwadis, the latter will have to be strengthened with high-quality infrastructure, play equipment, and well-trained Anganwadi workers/teachers. In this regard, all Anganwadi Workers are to be trained on ECCE principles, including using activities, play and indigenous and DIY toys, through 40,000 Master Trainers. As of January 2024, 3735 State Level Master Trainers have been trained through 95 training programmes, covering 25 States and 182 Districts.

The potential of Anganwadis as a useful employment generation institution and for creating a stronger and productive India of the future may be enhanced.

7.53  Besides  the  abovementioned  initiatives  to  ingrain  NEP  2020  in  school  education, an innovative programme  for community,  private sector, and alumnae  participation in  strengthening  Government  and  Government-aided  schools  is  delved  deeper  into  in Box VII.6.

## Box VII.6: Vidyanjali: A school volunteer programme

The  Vidyanjali  programme  was  launched  on  7  September  2021  to  strengthen  school infrastructure and improve the quality of school education through community participation, CSR and private sector involvement across the country as envisioned in the NEP 2020. The  programme  offers  companies/organisations/trusts,  and  groups  an  opportunity  to support  multiple  schools  of  their  choice  by  participating  in  projects  created  by  States/ UTs and autonomous bodies through a dedicated CSR module on the portal. This is not to substitute the Government's responsibility but to complement, supplement and strengthen Government efforts to reach the last mile in the best possible way.

Vidyanjali  portal  (https://vidyanjali.education.gov.in)  acts  as  a  facilitator  by  connecting volunteers  -  alumni  of  educational  institutions,  serving  and  retired  teachers,  scientists, Government/semi-Government  officials,  retired  armed  forces  personnel,  self-employed and salaried professionals, homemakers, persons from the Indian diaspora and any other organisation/group or company - directly with schools of their choice.

The Volunteers play a crucial role by bringing innovative teaching methods and interactive activities that foster creative thinking among students. Further, resourceful schools can also contribute their expertise and resources to schools that require additional support under the twinning of the school's feature under the programme.

## Impact of Vidyanjali

The Vidyanjali initiative has played a crucial role in enhancing the educational experiences of  over  1.44  crore  students  by  facilitating  comprehensive  community  engagement  and leveraging  volunteer  contributions  across  various  domains,  including  subject  assistance and mentoring and the provision of modern electronics and digital devices. This extensive volunteer involvement has enriched students' learning with diverse resources ranging from subject assistance and mentoring for gifted children to the provision of modern electronics and digital devices such as mobile phones and computers. Additionally, volunteers have supplied  essential  items  like  first  aid  kits  and  sports  equipment  and  even  transformed learning spaces with smart classrooms and upgraded kitchen gardens.

The initiative has successfully met many asset requests, with 26,268 requests completed. These requests encompass a variety of essential items and facilities crucial for enhancing the educational environment, such as basic electrical infrastructure, classroom needs, health and safety aids, etc. In addition to asset requests, the programme has completed 13,100 activities, each possibly extending over multiple days or tasks. Success stories include Delhi, which has demonstrated exemplary participation with 2883 out of 2969 schools registered, along with 14,882 active Volunteers.

## Progress in school infrastructure

7.54  Basic facilities in schools continued to improve in FY 23 over earlier years. Toilets (girls or boys), drinking water, and hand-washing facilities are now available in most Government schools. Priority to drinking water and sanitation in schools under the Samagra Shiksha Scheme and the Swachh Bharat Mission have been instrumental in providing required resources and creating  these  school  assets.  Under  the  Information  &amp;  Communication  Technology  (ICT) component of the Samagra Shiksha Scheme, the Government supports the establishment of smart classrooms and ICT labs in schools, including support for hardware, educational software, and e-content for teaching.

## National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023

7.55  Launched in August 2023, the NCF-SE 2023 brings to life the aims and commitment of NEP 2020 by enabling its implementation. The NCF was drafted by a 12-member National Steering Committee and sought inputs from around 16 lakh diverse stakeholders, including teachers, parents, students, educational institutions, neo- and non-literates, subjects' experts, scholars, Anganwadi personnel, etc., from across the country.

7.56  The NCF-2023 improves upon its predecessor, NCF-2005, in several ways, including, inter  alia,  promoting  competency-based  education 54 ,  introducing  vocational  education  from grade 3 rather than grade 9, learning languages native to India, and charting a comprehensive roadmap for ECCE and Foundational Literacy and Numeracy (FLN). This is transformational as FLN is a pre-requisite for instilling value into further years of school education and hence in realising learning outcomes (Muralidharan 2024) 55 . Besides, it brings more clarity, details, and direction on integrating Indigenous knowledge in the school curriculum, using education technology, including ICT, and moving away from rote memorisation.

54    Competency-based education is an approach that focuses on the development and demonstration of specific skills, knowledge, abilities, and dispositions, rather than solely relying on rote memorization.

## Vocational Education

7.57  Vocational education has received focused attention in the NEP 2020, which mandates its mainstreaming in all institutions, with focus areas based on skills gap analysis and mapping of  local  job  opportunities.  This  includes  the  development  of  pre-vocational  capacities  in children in the Foundational and preparatory stages and exposure to work in the middle stage, thus equipping them to achieve vocation-specific capacities/skills in the secondary stage in accordance with their aptitude, competence, and aspirations.

7.58  Under  the  Samagra  Shiksha  Scheme,  a  non-recurring  grant  for  purchasing  tools  and equipment,  including  furniture,  computers,  etc.,  is  given  to  states/UTs  to  augment  school infrastructure and accommodate vocational education. Assistance is also provided for capacity building of teachers/skill trainers, development of competency-based curriculum and teaching learning material, development of management information system, etc. States/UTs can choose from NSQF-compliant 113 job roles in 22 sectors. 56

7.59  In terms of progress achieved, 29,342 Schools have been covered under skill education from FY19 to FY24 (till March 2024). 22 sectors with 88 job roles were covered under Skill education till FY24. A total of 25 new job roles were introduced in FY24 under the Hub and scope  model,  under  which  infrastructure  of  the  hub  schools  can  be  utilised  by  the  nearby spoke schools, 1011 spoke schools have been approved. Exposure of skill education to upper primary students has been approved for 1,08,418 schools for FY25, and exposure has been given to 3643981 students. Employability skill modules, including communication skills, selfmanagement skills, ICT skills, entrepreneurship skills, and green skills, have been included in the job roles curriculum.

## Higher Education

7.60  The higher education sector, comprising tertiary and post-school learning in universities and other institutions, has witnessed an acceleration in total enrolment coupled with rising 'enrolment equity' over the past eight years. As per AISHE 2021-22 57 , total enrolment in higher education has increased to nearly 4.33 crore in FY22 from 4.14 crore in FY21 and 3.42 crore in FY15 (an increase of 26.5 per cent since FY15).

56    The 22 sectors are: Aerospace and Aviation, Agriculture, Apparel Made ups &amp; Home Furnishing, Automotive, Banking Finance and Insurance Services (BFSI), Beauty and Wellness, Construction, Electronics &amp; Hardware, Handicrafts and Carpets, Healthcare, Information Technology/Information Technology Enabled Services (IT/ ITeS), Management &amp; Entrepreneurship, Media &amp; Entertainment, Food Industry, Physical Education &amp; Sports, Plumber, Power, Retail, Security, Telecom, Tourism &amp; Hospitality, Transportation Logistics &amp; Warehousing.

57    All India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) is the only comprehensive survey by the Ministry of Education (MoE) to capture the data on Higher Education in the country since 2011 to create a robust and inclusive database for Higher Education. Information in AISHE 2021-22 is related to financial year 2021-22, i.e. From 1st April 2021 to 31st March 2022.

## Rising equity in higher education

7.61  The rise in enrolment in higher education has been driven by underprivileged sections such as SC, ST and OBC, with a faster growth in female enrolment across sections. Female enrolment in higher education increased to 2.07 crore in FY22 from 1.57 crore in FY15, i.e., a  31.6  per  cent  increase  since  FY15.  The  growing  equity  in  higher  education  implies  better employment opportunities for the hitherto backward sections.

## Re-imagining lifelong learning through a digital prism

7.62  India has 26.52 crore students in school, 4.33 crore in higher education and more than 11 crore learners in skilling institutions. The vast expanse of the educational landscape comprises 14.89 lakh schools, 1.50 lakh secondary schools, 1.42 lakh higher secondary schools 58 , 1,168 Universities,  45,473  colleges,  12,002  standalone  institutions 59 ,  94.8  lakh  teachers  in  school education and 15.98 lakh teachers in higher education.

7.63  These  sweeping  figures  put  into  perspective  the  enormity  of  the  challenge  and  the inherent ambition of the NEP 2020 to transform India's educational ecosystem. NEP lies at the heart of efforts towards strengthening institutional capacity to embed lifelong learning in the education and skills ecosystem. It calls for interconnectedness of initiatives across formal, non-formal, and informal modes to make learning systems more holistic, multidisciplinary, and comprehensive to address diverse learning needs.

7.64  The National Credit Framework (NCrF), announced under NEP in April 2023, forms the bulwark of the regulatory architecture underpinning life-long learning. Bolstering the regulatory architecture is an extensive array of digital solutions, such as digital public infrastructure (DPI), which act as force multipliers. Prime among India's educational DPIs is APAAR, i.e. Automated Permanent Academic Account Registry, which serves as an electronic registry for institutions, students, and faculty by creating unique identities and lifelong academic credentials for each stakeholder in the education space. APAAR is supplemented by the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC), an online repository of academic credits that facilitates students' mobility across Higher

58    https://dashboard.udiseplus.gov.in/#/reportDashboard/sDashboard

59    https://tinyurl.com/4sp5tkpz

Education Institutions (HEIs) through a formal process of credit recognition, accumulation, transfer and redemption. Once an APAAR ID is created, HEIs map the credits a student earns to their ID, with all such credits stored in the ABC in demat form.

7.65  The twin solution of APAAR and ABC, by allowing real-time verification of identity and academic credentials, paves the way for several interesting use cases. These include the possibility of students pursuing credit courses from different institutions for a particular qualification (now a  reality)  or  targeting  scholarships/ internships/ educational loans using academic profiles. With the data consent layer built into these DPIs, an exciting world of possibilities opens where the data principal (students) can share their academic credentials with prospective employers or institutions for internships, jobs or collaborative opportunities. As of July 2024, 2037 HEIs have onboarded ABC, and 30.13 crore APAAR IDs have been created for students of higher education, school education and skill institutes. 60

7.66  India's online learning architecture has been instrumental in creditisation, with University Grants Commission (UGC) Regulations enabling students to earn up to 40 per cent of credits from online courses. Box VII.7 below gives a detailed list of major initiatives in this regard.

## Box VII.7: India's online learning architecture

Powered by the combination of Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM), SWAYAM PRABHA and SWAYAM Plus, indigenously crafted platforms have emerged  as  powerful  catalysts  in  bridging  the  digital  divide  and  achieving  the  cardinal principles of NEP, viz., access, equity and quality.

- SWAYAM, an open learning MOOC platform, has been pivotal in ensuring students across  India  have  access  to  high-quality  content,  thus  mainstreaming  them  into  the knowledge  economy.  The  platform  has  13140+  course  offerings  across  disciplines, including emerging technologies like AI, Machine Learning and cloud computing. With an enrolment of 4.3 crore, SWAYAM has emerged as one of the most popular e-learning platforms today.
- SWAYAM PRABHA, a DTH (Direct to Home) Satellite TV service comprising 48 DTH channels, has provided UG/PG level educational content across various subjects, available 24x7 with a structured schedule. This service has a remarkable reach, captivating over 1.2 million students and viewing 143,000+ unique videos, totalling 86,000+ hours of watch time.
- SWAYAM Plus is an online platform led by IIT Madras, featuring high-quality courses for  credit  recognition  in  collaboration  with  academia  and  industry  leaders  like  L&amp;T and  Microsoft.  It  aims  to  boost  employability  among  college  students  and  lifelong learners, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, through courses developed in partnership with industry, focusing on areas such as Manufacturing, Energy, Computer Science &amp; Engineering/IT/ITES,  Management,  Healthcare,  Hospitality  &amp;  Tourism,  and  Indian Knowledge Systems. The initiative provides an avenue for upskilling and reskilling to meet dynamic industry requirements.

- The NEP emphasises enhancing mobility, flexibility, and choices in higher education. SAMARTH, an e-governance solution  developed  in  collaboration  by  the  Ministry  of Education with the Indian Institute of Crafts and Design, aims to digitally transform administrative processes in HEIs, from admissions to awarding degrees. It has been adopted by over 3500 HEIs, including Central Universities, State Universities, Colleges, IITs, IIMs, etc., contributing to establishing a network of digitally-enabled campuses across India.
- The PM e-VIDYA initiative unifies digital  education  efforts,  offering  diverse  content access through DIKSHA and Sathee platforms. DIKSHA features over 3.5 lakh e-contents and 6,854 Energized Textbooks in 30+ languages. 61  Sathee platform provides resources for  competitive  exam  preparation,  including  around  2000  video  lectures,  80,000+ problems, mock tests, an AI chatbot, and mentorship from IIT and AIIMS students for NEET and JEE aspirants.

## Way forward in education

7.67  As education is one of the most critical areas for India's development, mission-mode and cost-effective implementation of well-designed and well-intentioned programmes is essential to improve the quality of education, especially primary education, without which further years of education add little value. To realise the same, unity of purpose and convergence of efforts across the centre, state, and local Governments is called for, as 'public education' is a concurrent list subject.

7.68  To  operationalise  vocational  education  across  the  learning  ladder,  the  model  of  Lend A Hand India (LAHI), an NGO, is a good example. The LAHI model includes civil society's collaboration with the Governments to introduce vocational education as a core curriculum component, establish labs, recruit and train vocational trainers, organise internships, and offer placement support. By providing comprehensive vocational education services and engaging with key stakeholders, civil society can play an active role in implementing the novel features of NEP 2020.

7.69  Increasing the cost-effectiveness of public spending on education requires spending on pedagogy and governance. This can include filling supervisory positions to monitor teaching quality, recognition of good and bad teacher performance, and hiring of local volunteers to ensure  'teaching  at  the  right  level'  as  textbook  completion  means  little  if  children  are  way behind curricular standards (Muralidharan 2024) 62

## India making headway in R&amp;D

7.70  Research and Development (R&amp;D) is an important source of innovation, progress and increased productivity in an economy. In economics, the endogenous growth theory highlights the long-run economic growth to be determined by the rate of technological progress, alluding to the ultimate sway of R&amp;D on a nation's progress. R&amp;D provides businesses with the technical know-how  to  improve  productivity,  reduce  operating  costs  and  raise  competitiveness. 63 In

7.71 India is making rapid progress in R&amp;D, with nearly one lakh patents granted in FY24 64 , compared to  less  than  25,000  patent  grants  in  FY20. 65 According  to  WIPO,  India  saw  the highest growth (31.6 per cent) in patent filings in 2022 66 , demonstrating its evolving innovation landscape  and  potential  for  further  growth  in  intellectual  property  creation.  India  has consistently improved its rank in the Global Innovation Index from 81 st  position in 2015 to 40 th in 2023, as per GII (2023). 67  On the human resource side, total Ph.D. enrolment in India has increased to 81.2 per cent in FY22 (2.13 lakh) from FY15 (1.17 lakh). 68  The Gross Expenditure on R&amp;D (GERD) in the country has been consistently increasing over the years and has more than doubled fromâ‚¹60,196.8 crore in FY11 to â‚¹ 127,381 crore in FY21 (Chart VII.8).

7.72  As a mark of India's ascent in high-quality research, the country climbed up to 9 th rank in the Nature's Index 2023 69 , overtaking Australia and Switzerland 70 . India's share 71 of high-quality research articles (measured in terms of absolute numbers and not percentages) increased by 44 per cent in the past four years, i.e., from 1039.7 in 2019 to 1494.7 in 2023. However, India's share remains significantly lower compared to above 20,000 share of China and the US each.

69    The Nature Index provides absolute Count and fractional Share counts of article publication at the institutional and national level and, as such, is an indicator of global high-quality research output and collaboration.

71    Share is a metric that measures contribution to papers in the Index by authors based in a country compared to all authors of the article. For instance, if there are 4 authors of an article and all 4 are from India, it will add 1.0 to India's share. If 2 out of 4 authors are from India, it will add 0.5 to India's share.

7.73  However,  India's  R&amp;D  investment  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  stands  at  0.64  per  cent, compared to China (2.41 per cent), the US (3.47 per cent), and Israel (5.71 per cent). Moreover, the private sector's contribution to R&amp;D remains low at 36.4 per cent of the country's GERD compared to China (77 per cent), US (75 per cent), etc. 72 .

7.74  To better translate GERD to research output, the link between higher education, industry and research must be strengthened. Another challenge is low 'Land to Lab' time. Institutions in India develop technologies, but their transformation rate from the lab to the society for the benefit of the people remains low. 73

7.75 Several  efforts  are  underway  to  attract  research  personnel  and  create  adequate  opportunities in the research ecosystem of the nation. The ease of doing research is being bolstered through streamlining  of  patent  grants,  leading  to  a  drastic  reduction  in  the  average  time  taken  for examination of a patent application from 72 months in 2015 to between 5 to 23 months in 2022, depending upon fields of technology. 74  The Government has recently decided to increase the scholarships for students pursuing PhD and Post-Doctoral research. 75  Further, India has launched its own National Research Foundation called 'Anusandhan' 76  operationalised by the Department of Science and Technology (under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation Act, 2023 Act 77 ). This foundation will act as an apex body that aims to strengthen and promote the R&amp;D ecosystem. In the interim budget of FY25, the Government also announced a corpus of 1 lakh crore for research and innovation in the country, adopting the slogan ' Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Jai Vigyan, Jai Anusandhan'.
