# Rural Economy: Driving the Growth Engine

## RURAL ECONOMY: DRIVING THE GROWTH ENGINE

7.102  The  integrated  and  sustainable  development  of  rural  India  is  at  the  heart  of  the Government's  governance  strategy.  The  focus  is  on  holistic  economic  betterment  through decentralised  planning,  better  access  to credit, skilling  of  youth,  enhanced  livelihood opportunities, empowerment of women, social security net provision, basic housing, education, health, and sanitation facilities, etc. Thrust on welfare services like school infrastructure, primary healthcare centres, technology solutions to issues of governance, improved means of transport and  communications,  etc.,  is  aimed  at  equipping  the  populace  with  long-term  capabilities for living the kind of lives they value. This section presents some of the Government's rural development policies and programmes.

## Enhancing the quality of life in rural India

7.103  The  Government  is  working  towards  providing  basic  amenities  to  all  households  in rural areas through many schemes and programmes. A summary of the progress in this regard follows.

7.104  Rural  demand  has  been  rising  in  2023-24,  as  seen  in  a  composite  indicator  of  rural activity 137   constructed by NABARD economists in a recent working paper (Pattanaik, Gupta, and Jadhav, 2024) 138 . The index indicates that rural demand weakened during the COVID-19 waves and showed expansion during FY24. Normally, rural demand peaks every year in the immediate post-festival period of October and slackens before kharif sowing.

## Strengthening and modernising the safety net of MGNREGS

7.105  The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act 2005 (MGNREGA) aims at enhancing the livelihood security of households in rural areas of the country by providing at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. 139

7.106    The  physical  progress  of  MGNREGS  (the  Scheme  through  which  MGNREGA  is implemented) in terms of person-days generation, average person-days per household and participation of women is indicated below:

Table VII.8: Key indicators on MGNREGS

7.107  Multiple efficiency reforms have been introduced to fully utilise the scheme. To ensure probity  and  elimination  of  leakages,  geotagging  before,  during,  and  after  the  work  is  being done, 140   99.9 per cent payments are through National Electronic Fund Management System, wages are transferred under DBT, Aadhaar-based payment has been enabled in 98.6 per cent of total Active workers, and Social Audit units have been set up in 28 states/UT.

7.108  While MGNREGS began as a wage employment scheme, it has evolved into an assetcreation programme for sustainable livelihood diversification, as seen in the rise in the share of individual beneficiary 'works on individual land' from 9.6 per cent of total completed works in FY14 to 73.3 per cent in FY24 (the share in terms of expenditure is much lower, yet rose from 6.1 per cent in FY14 to 32.1 per cent in FY22). Capacity development of workers is being promoted initiatives like Bare Foot Technicians (BFT) 141   and UNNATI 142   skilling project.

7.109  Further, in order to derive maximum impact from the scheme, it has been converged with various initiatives such as Nutri-Garden for individual beneficiaries and community in

139    Implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development from 2 February 2006, this Act initially covered 200 most backward districts of the country. It was implemented in an additional 130 districts in Phase II, during 20072008. The Act was notified in the remaining rural districts of the country from April 1, 2008 in Phase III

140    More than 5.73 crore assets have been geo-tagged (as of 31 March 2024) and made available in the public domain, since its launch in 2016.

141  So far, 9387 BFTs have been trained in 20 States.

142    The UNNATI skilling project aims to upskill MGNREGS workers by providing training to one adult member (of age 18-45 years) of a household who has completed 100 days of work under Mahatma Gandhi NREGA in the financial year from 2018-19. Full expenditures towards a stipend, against wage loss compensation, are entirely borne by the Central Government. This project was launched in FY20 and aims to enhance the skill base of 2 lakh Mahatma Gandhi NREGA beneficiaries in three years, i.e., FY20, FY21 and FY22. So far, about 59,350 candidates have been trained.

7.110  Box VII.9 examines whether spending on MGNREGS is an indicator of rural distress.

## Box VII.9: Is MGNREGS spending an indicator of rural distress?

There is a marked variation in the performance of the MGNREGS across states. Multiple research studies 143,144,145   have been conducted to find a definite cause for such unevenness in outcomes but a satisfactory explanation has not been found. Some reports 146,147  suggest that MGNREGS demand is indicative of rural distress. If this is indeed the case then data trends should show that States with more poverty and higher unemployment rates use more Scheme funds and generate more employment person-days. Additionally, there might be a correlation between MGNREGS fund usage and reduced unemployment. MGNREGS wages could  reflect  state  poverty  levels.  Past  studies 148   have  attempted  to  correlate  MGNREGS demand with weather data to indicate real-time rural distress, but the hypothesis needs verification.

## Insights from MGNREGS Data

Data for FY24 149  shows that although Tamil Nadu has less than 1 per cent of the country's poor  population, 150 it  accounted  for  nearly  15  per  cent  of  all  MGNREGS  funds  released. Similarly, Kerala, with only 0.1 per cent of the poor population, used almost 4 per cent of the  Nation's  MGNREGS funds. Together, these states generated 51 crore person-days of employment. In contrast, Bihar and UP, with about 45 per cent (20 per cent and 25 per cent respectively) of the poor population, accounted for only 17 per cent (6 per cent and 11 per cent respectively) of MGNREGA funds and generated 53 crore person-days of employment (Chart VII.12).

Additionally,  calculations  reveal  that  there  is  little  correlation  between  MGNREGS  fund usage and rural unemployment rates. Data from FY23 153  shows that states with the highest rural  unemployment  rates  did  not  necessarily  use  the  most  MGNREGS  funds.  Contrary to  the  popular  narrative,  the  data  does  not  support  the  idea  that  states  with  high  rural unemployment rates in FY22 sought more MGNREGS funds in FY23 (Chart VII.13).

Under the MGNREGA, unless a national minimum wage is set (which the Act permits), states can set their own minimum wage. This fixation should ideally consider local employment opportunities, per-capita incomes, and alternate income sources. However, scheme data 154 reveals that minimum wage fixation is ad-hoc and not correlated with per-capita income or poverty headcount ratio. States such as Haryana, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and others have relatively high notified wage rates in MGNREGA (Chart VII.14), relative to their percapita incomes. This significantly impacts state-wise MGNREGS fund usage, as the wage component is fully borne by the Central Government.

## Diagnosis of the factors that explain differences in MGNREGA work demands across States

It is evident from the data above that MGNREGS work demand does not directly correlate with  increased  rural  distress  at  a  micro  level.  The  remarkable  evolution  of  MGNREGS work from being the last resort of village-resident families to becoming more of a smart choice for household asset creation and sustainable income generation has also been noted previously. 155  This indicates that other important aspects must be factored in to explain the State level differences in fund usage. Some of these are discussed below.

## Supply-side issues

Difference  in  time  taken  by  DoRD  to  release  funds  to  different  StatesThe  automated process by DoRD ensures no significant variation in fund release times to different States, indicating that this is not a cause of state-wise differences in fund usage.

Appropriation of MGNREGA budget between statesDifferences in MGNREGS fund usage could likely stem from projected annual demands in the agreed labour budgets. Projections 156 for FY25 show that states with a high rural poor population 157 , like UP, MP, and Bihar, will have higher annual person-days. Thus, the variance is likely due to actual fund usage based on the work completed.

## Demand-side issues

State's institutional capacity to tap benefits under the MGNREGS- To access MGNREGS funds, state governments must finalise labour budgets for the upcoming financial year in advance, following a bottom-up planning process. This includes Gram Panchayat meetings, approvals at Block and District levels, and compilation at the State level. States must utilize at least 75 per cent of the previous year's funds, provide utilisation certificates, expenditure statements, and social audit achievements to apply for fund tranches. 158   States with better institutional capacities and trained functionaries can complete this process on time.

Literature 159,160,161 establishes  a  link  between  per-capita  income  and  institutional  quality. States with lower per-capita incomes and higher poverty levels often have weaker institutions, thereby tapping fewer funds per work executed and generating less employment per capita for the rural poor. 162   FY24 data 163   shows that states like UP (~10 lakh works), Karnataka

(~9 lakh works), and MP (~7.77 lakh works) executed many works but used fewer MGNREGA funds per work (₹0.93 lakh, ₹0.55 lakh and ₹0.72 lakhs respectively). Conversely, states like Puducherry (₹8.96 lakh per work), Haryana (₹. 4.89 lakh), Rajasthan (₹2.76 lakh), and Tamil Nadu (₹2 lakh) tapped more funds per work.

The trend is similar for person-days employment generated per capita of the rural poor, with Tamil Nadu (69), Kerala (62), Rajasthan (42), and Puducherry (30) outperforming UP (7), MP (10), and Bihar (6). States with higher institutional capacities plan and coordinate better, executing costlier works in rural infrastructure or natural resources management. In contrast, lower-income states like Assam, Jharkhand, Bihar, UP, Chhattisgarh, MP, and Rajasthan have a higher proportion of 'individual works' 164  (50 per cent or more), which are less costly and require less planning.

Thus, a state's institutional capacity is crucial for effectively tapping MGNREGS funds.

Differences in registering demandDespite provisions mandating State governments to grant unemployment allowance if work is not provided within 15 days, only ₹90,000 was released in FY 24 and ₹7.8 lakh in FY23 across all states. 165 Further, evaluation reports 166 indicate that employment was often unavailable when sought. This suggests that block-level functionaries may not register demand in real time. Consequently, formal data showing MGNREGS work demand may not reflect the true demand and current rural economic distress. This also indicates that work demanded is only reported on the portal when employment is actually provided ( presumably to save on the State Government's liability towards unemployment allowance ). Hence work demanded on the portal is de-facto equivalent to work provided and not the 'real' demand.

Increased  leakagesVariations  in  MGNREGS  fund  usage  arise  from  irregularities  and leakages observed across states. Despite lacking exhaustive documentation, news reports 167 , social  audits 168 and  anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  funds  often  do  not  reach  intended beneficiaries, making demand an unreliable distress indicator. Over four years, Social Audit Units found ₹935 crore misappropriated under MGNREGS. Instances of workers paying contractors and giving up job cards 169 ; illegal use of machines instead of labour, unrealistic labour budgets, delays in fund release 170 , lack of job card updates and unverified bills have been reported from different regions. The Social Accountability Forum's audit 171  reported ₹658 crore misappropriated over 2018-20, with grievances focusing on wage issues, job cards, and worksites. It also noted that transparency, accountability, and record-keeping processes were often violated in MGNREGA implementation.

From the above diagnostic analysis, it can be concluded that demand under MGNREGS is not a real indicator of rural distress but is rather predominantly linked with the State's institutional  capacity  and  to  some  extent  also  different  minimum  wages  and  other considerations.

## Nurturing rural entrepreneurship at the grassroots

7.111  The  Government has implemented a bouquet of vibrant schematic interventions with a  distinct  focus  on  seamless  access  to  affordable  finance  and  generating  lucrative  market opportunities that ultimately aim to provide a fillip to rural entrepreneurship. The Government remains  committed  to  bolstering  rural  entrepreneurship  and  has  been  at  the  forefront  of implementing  a  plethora  of  schemes  aimed  at  livelihood  generation,  providing  easy  access to  finance  and  marketing,  and  developing  a  common  infrastructure  for  promoting  rural entrepreneurship. Some of the schemes and programmes are mentioned in Box VII.10 below.

## Box VII.10: Initiatives fostering rural entrepreneurship

- (a)    Deendayal  Antyodaya  Yojana-  National  Rural  Livelihood  Mission  (DAYNRLM), for  instance,  is  one  of  the  world's  largest  social  sector  schemes  aiming  to empower  poor  households  to  access  meaningful  self-employment  and  skilled  wage employment opportunities. DAY- NRLM has helped women access scientific knowledge, specialised skills, and valuable exposure to motivate and ignite new energy to reform their livelihoods and venture into new activities. They have taken up enterprises like solar panels to prepare sanitary pads, soaps, detergents, face masks, sanitisers, fencing materials, etc. Initiated in 2011, the Mission has its footprint across 7135 blocks in 742 districts of 28 states and 6 UTs. The progress of the programme on key components has been summarised below.

## (b)    Lakhpati Didis initiative

- The Lakhpati  Didis initiative,  launched  in  2023,  targets  to  uplift  three  crore  SHG households to a minimum annual income of ₹1 lakh within three years. It focuses on diversified livelihood activities, district-level planning, household support, Government department convergence, and capacity building of staff and community members.
- (c)    Saras Aajeevika portal and eSARAS mobile App (launched in 2023) showcase a wide array of authentic handcrafted products, such as linen items, furniture, apparel, pickles, etc., made by SHGs. By creating a dedicated marketplace for their indigenously crafted products, the platform thus catalyses rural women into new-age entrepreneurs.
- (d)    Start-Up  Village  Entrepreneurship  Programme  (SVEP) and Aajeevika Grameen Express Yojana (AGEY) are being implemented as non-farm livelihood strategies under DAY-NRLM. SVEP supports entrepreneurs in rural areas in setting up local enterprises. The strategy is to promote knowledge about business feasibility management, provide start-up loan finance access, and scale up the existing enterprise. 2.97 lakh enterprises have been formed in 221 blocks of 29 states/UT. AGEY provides safe, affordable and community-monitored transport services to rural areas. Around 2333  vehicles  are  operational  in  26  states,  providing  transport  services  to  connect remote rural villages.
- (e)    The  Rural  Self  Employment  Training  Institute  (RSETI)  scheme, which  is a  sub-scheme  of  the  NRLM,  is  also  aimed  at  strengthening  rural  entrepreneurship. RSETIs are essentially district-level Self Employment Training Institutes in rural areas managed by the banks and funded by the Ministry of Rural Development. They provide free-of-cost skill training, credit assistance, and mentorship to rural unemployed youth aged 18-45 years, with an approach of short-term training &amp; long-term hand-holding of  entrepreneurs.  Their  tailor-made  curriculum  is  designed  to  match  the  local  demands of the agricultural economy and small rural businesses. Since the scheme's inception in 2009, 50.72 lakh candidates have been trained, and 36.23 lakh candidates have been settled  as  entrepreneurs/apprentices  till  June  2024,  with  a  settlement  rate  of  more than 72 per cent.
- (f)    Financing rural entrepreneurship: To support rural entrepreneurs, the National  Bank  for  Agriculture  and  Rural  Development  (NABARD)  promotes  Micro Entrepreneurship  Development  Programmes  (MEDPs)  and  Livelihood  &amp;  Enterprise Development  Programmes  (LEDPs),  focusing  on  funding  and  skill  improvement. NABARD backs SHGs, JLGs, POs, and Micro-entrepreneurs with training and helps them  sell  their  products  on  online  platforms  and  the  Open  Network  for  Digital Commerce (ONDC). Additionally, Off-Farm Producer Organisations (OFPOs) receive guidance to join ONDC. By 31 March 2023, around 5.85 lakh SHG members benefitted from 20,174 MEDPs, receiving ₹52.39 crore in grants, and 2.67 lakh SHG members from 2149 LEDPs, with ₹106.10 crore in grants.

- (g) The 'SARAS Mela' by the Ministry of Rural Development helps SHG beneficiaries sell their products directly in urban markets, eliminating middlemen and improving artisans' margins. It allows rural producers to engage with buyers, tailor products to consumer preferences, and hone their marketing skills.
- (h)    Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY): DDU-GKY is  a  state-led, outcome-driven skilling program focused on rural youth, emphasizing sustainable employment, PPP, and independent third-party certification of outcomes through Sector  Skill  Councils.  The  programme  occupies  a  unique  position  amongst other  skill  training  programmes  due  to  its  focus  on  the  poor  rural  youth  and  its emphasis on sustainable employment through the prominence and incentives given to post-placement tracking, retention and career progression. Special sub-schemes called ROSHNI and Himayat are also being implemented. A total of 16.5 lakh candidates have been trained, and 10.48 lakh candidates placed under the scheme till June 2024 (provisional).

7.112  Looking forward, the wide local presence of RSETIs (591 RSETIs functioning across 577 districts of the country 172 )  and  tri-partnership of banks, state Governments, and the central Government can be leveraged  to  converge  efforts  across  Government  programmes  such  as skilling and livelihood diversification, farm mechanisation through Krishi Vigyan Kendra, job fairs, SHGs, farmer producer organisations, primary agricultural cooperative societies etc. By acting as the fulcrum of skill and credit linkage at the grassroots, RSETIs can thus emerge as district-level enterprise hubs. 173

7.113  The  potential  of  SHGs  needs  to  be  tapped  by  enabling  their  upscaling  into  larger enterprises, harnessing professional support and management. For instance, the mobilisation of  tribal  women into operating, managing, and owning solar lamp factories and retail solar shops  in  Dungarpur,  Rajasthan,  was  made  possible  through  handholding  by  Prof.  Chetan Solanki of IIT Bombay and support by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, and local administration. 174 With  proper  training  and  professional  guidance,  women's  collectives  can emerge as self-sustainable enterprises at scale.

## Rural Governance: A story of digital transformations at the grassroots

7.114 Rural development has immense benefits to derive from better rural governance, which can serve as the foundation and multiplier force for both programme-led impact creation and individual-led utilisation of rising opportunities. With a 200 per cent increase in rural internet subscriptions between 2015 and 2021 175 , digitisation of governance is a low-hanging fruit to reduce the distance between the village and the administrative headquarters, which is crucial

in regional development. 176 In this aspect, multiple digitisation initiatives have been unfolding in rural India.

## Box VII.11: Digitisation initiatives to improve rural governance

## e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project

The e-Panchayat project seeks to automate the internal workflow processes of approximately 2.71 lakh Panchayats or equivalent bodies, benefiting around 30 lakh elected members and about ten lakh PRI functionaries. In addition, the Government has introduced an application called AuditOnline under the e-Panchayat Mission Mode Project to facilitate online audits of Panchayat accounts and maintain detailed records of internal and external audits.  177

## e-Gram SWARAJ

On National Panchayati Raj Day on 24 April 2020, e-Gram SWARAJ (https://egramswaraj. gov.in/) was launched to introduce digital Panchayats for rural India. The platform provides a  complete  profile  of  the  Gram  Panchayat,  including  demographic  details,  finances,  and activities  outlined  in  the  Gram  Panchayat  Development  Plan  (GPDP).  It  also  integrates with the Public Financial Management System (PFMS) to enable real-time payments and better financial management. 2.52 lakh Gram Panchayats have prepared and uploaded their GPDPs for FY24 on e-Gram SWARAJ. 178

## Bhu-Aadhaar

The  Identification  Parcel  Number  (ULPIN)  or  Bhu-Aadhaar  is  a  14-digit  identification number assigned to a land parcel based on its longitude and latitude coordinates. It aims to facilitate demarcation, identification, and standardisation of land parcels, enabling different

Government  departments  to  provide  land-related  services  to  citizens,  including  multidepartmental services. Proper land statistics and land accounting through ULPIN would help develop land banks and an Integrated Land Information Management System (ILIMS). ULPIN has been rolled out in 29 states, generating approximately 14.94 crore ULPINs.  179

## SVAMITVA Scheme

SVAMITVA (Survey of Villages and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas) is  a  Central  Sector  Scheme  launched  in  2020  to  provide  the  'Record  of  Rights'  to  rural household owners. It aims to enable property monetization, reduce disputes, and facilitate comprehensive village-level planning. The drone survey has been completed in 2.90 lakh villages and 1.66 crore property cards have been prepared for 1.06 lakh villages. The scheme has  been  implemented  in  Haryana,  Uttarakhand,  Puducherry,  Andaman  and  Nicobar Islands, and Goa. 180
