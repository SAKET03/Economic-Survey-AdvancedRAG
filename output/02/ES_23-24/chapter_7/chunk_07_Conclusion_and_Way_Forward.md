# Conclusion and Way Forward

## CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD

7.121  The Indian economy is moving forward with a reformed approach to welfare, focused on empowerment, efficiency in the delivery of services, and participation of the private sector and civil society. In terms of outreach, the saturation of basic necessities has been recognised as the first step to productive participation of every citizen in the economy, imperative for sustained medium-term  growth.  In  terms  of  efficiency,  the  digitisation  of  healthcare,  education  and governance is a force multiplier for every rupee spent on a welfare programme.

7.122  The education sector is bustling with the across-the-board transformation led by the NEP 2020, which is expected to yield Foundational Literacy And Numeracy for every child passing the third standard in the near future. That said, improving learning outcomes and undoing the COVID-induced learning loss is more urgent than ever. In healthcare, Ayushman Bharat is not only saving lives but also saving generations from the trap of debt. The challenge of ensuring mental health and well-being is intrinsically and economically valuable. In the age of social media and 'the great rewiring of childhood', this challenge must be met together with destigmatisation, community participation, and fortification of specialised human resources.

7.123  Women-led  development  is  emanating  from  their  social,  economic,  and  political empowerment, occurring through a constructive intermingling of policy and social change. Nevertheless, much scope remains to enhance asset ownership among women, with significant intrinsic and instrumental gains of fairness and economy to be secured.

7.124  Better quality of life in the hinterland is being reinforced by a host of enabling programmes. The self-help movement has come far in terms of its outreach, and the social capital stands to gain from professional assistance in marketing and management. To provide a fillip to rural enterprises, RSETI can be utilised as district hubs of skill development and enterprise.

7.125  Further, a scheme, however well-designed and noble in its formulation, is only as good as its implementation. It is the governance and unity of purpose at all levels of Government which is the keystone to the success of a social programme. To maximise this efficiency of translating spending into outcomes, many channels at the ground level will have to be unclogged.

7.126  At the heart of economic development lies human development, which is both the means and ends of the former. Unswerving in its commitment, India has a lot to be content about and a lot to be impatient for.
