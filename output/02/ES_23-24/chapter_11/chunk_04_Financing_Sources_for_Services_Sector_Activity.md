11.16 Credit to the services sector flowed across sub-sectors like transport operators, tourism, hotels  and  restaurants,  aviation,  professional  services,  trade,  and  commercial  real  estate. The aviation sector experienced the most significant credit inflow YoY growth of 56 per cent, attributed to increased aircraft leasing, hiring and a positive medium to long-term growth outlook.

## External Financing

11.17 The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has published the World Investment Report 2024 (WIR 2024) and has ranked India 15 th  in terms of FDI inflow (top 20 host economies) for the year 2023. As per the WIR 2024, India is the 2 nd  largest host country in terms of number of international project finance deals and 4 th  largest in terms of number of Greenfield project announcements. 11

11.18 FY24 witnessed a decline in the FDI equity inflows to the services sector (Chart XI.9), as in the case of the overall FDI equity inflows to India. Higher interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, heightened global uncertainties and rising protectionism that favour domestic sourcing have all contributed to lower FDI inflows into the sector.
