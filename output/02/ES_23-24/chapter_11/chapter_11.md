## SERVICES: FUELLING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES

<!-- image -->

Through the vicissitudes of the last three decades, the services sector stood as the bulwark of India's economic growth. Its post-pandemic dynamics, particularly the trends and patterns that emerged and solidified during FY24, indicate an ongoing transformation in domestic service delivery systems and their demands. Aided by the focus on policy and procedural reforms, physical infrastructure and logistics, all significant business, personal, financial and infrastructure-based services have emerged strongly from the pandemic.  However,  the  transformation  lies  in  the  fast-paced  shift  towards  digital services like online payments, e-commerce, and entertainment platforms, as well as the increase in the demand for high-tech services as inputs in other productive activities. India's young and tech-savvy population offers an opportunity to enhance the country's vocational and educational ecosystem further. This will equip the labour force with the required digital and high-tech skills in a time-bound manner, helping India reap the full dividends of these opportunities.

## INTRODUCTION

11.1 India's services sector encompasses a wide array of economic activities, which can be broadly classified  into  two  categories:  contact-intensive  and  non-contact-intensive  services. The former includes trade, hospitality, transport, real estate, social, community and personal services. The latter comprises financial, information technology, professional, communication, broadcasting,  and  storage  services.  The  sector  also  incorporates  public  administration  and defence services.

11.2 The services sector continues to be a significant contributor to India's growth, accounting for about 55 per cent of the total size of the economy in FY24. Several demand and supply side factors  determine  the  performance  of  the  services  sector.  The  significant  domestic  demand for services such as education, healthcare, finance, tourism, hospitality, and entertainment is underpinned by a large and young population. Rapid urbanisation supports transportation, housing, sanitation, and utility services. The expansion of e-commerce platforms has generated heightened  requirements  for  logistics,  digital  payments,  and  related  services.  Information technology and business services will likely retain their prominent international presence in the medium term. However, studies suggest that the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is likely to restrain the growth opportunities for business services progressively and, therefore, poses a challenge to long-term sustainability and job creation. Thus, focusing on human capital

to take advantage of the agglomeration effects of large, well-functioning cities is critical for the growth of services, especially those with global market potential. 1

11.3 The Government has played a crucial role in fostering the growth and competitiveness of India's services sector by creating an enabling environment, promoting investment, enhancing skills,  and  facilitating  market  access.  For  instance,  the  Digital  India  campaign  has  fostered growth  in  digital  services,  export  promotion  schemes  have  encouraged  services  exports, infrastructure development has boosted logistics, tourism, and hospitality industry, and skill development initiatives have provided increased opportunities for the workforce. Furthermore, targeted  efforts  in  healthcare  and  tourism  have  enhanced  accessibility  and  development, ensuring a promising future for India's services sector.

11.4 The  remaining  sections  of  the  chapter  are  organised  with  the  emerging  services landscape in the country as outlined above in view. The following section provides an overview of the performance of the services sectors in terms of domestic output and international trade activity, followed by a section on financial flows into the services sector. This is followed by a deep dive into the performance of various services sub-sectors and related policy initiatives. It may be noted that the developments in important social services like education and health are dealt with in Chapter 7 of this Survey. The last two sections highlight the challenges and opportunities in the services sector and concludes with a future outlook.

## OVERVIEW OF THE SERVICES SECTOR PERFORMANCE

## Gross Value Added (GVA) in the services sector

11.5 The services sector witnessed a real growth rate of more than 6 per cent in all the years in  the  last  decade  except  in  the  pandemic-affected  FY21.  Globally,  India's  services  exports constituted 4.4 per cent of the world's commercial services exports in 2022.

11.6 The contribution of the services sector to the overall GVA has increased significantly in the last decade. The sector's share dropped in FY21 due to the pandemic-induced contraction. However, as shown in Chart XI.3, the sector's share has almost recovered to the pre-COVID levels.

Note: Estimates for FY23 are First Revised Estimates, and for FY24 are Provisional Estimates.

11.7 For a decade before COVID, the services sector's real growth rate consistently exceeded the overall economic growth. However, in FY21, the services sector saw a sharper contraction of 8.4 per cent compared to a 4.1 per cent decline in overall GVA. Non-contact intensive services, primarily  financial,  information  technology  and  professional  services,  experienced  positive and steady growth due to fewer disruptions and increased demand for digital services. The contraction was concentrated in contact-intensive services due to lockdowns, restricted travel, and reduced demand for hospitality, entertainment, and personal services due to preventive measures. As the restrictions  were  lifted,  these  sectors  rebounded,  aided  by  the  supportive policy environment. Hence, post-COVID, the services sector's growth outpaced overall GVA growth in FY23 and FY24, reclaiming its role in driving the economy's upward trajectory.

11.8 As per the Provisional Estimates, the services sector is estimated to have grown 7.6 per cent  in  FY24.  Various  high-frequency  indicators  support  the  services  sector's  growth  story. Both  GST  collections  and  the  issuance  of  e-way  bills,  reflecting  wholesale  and  retail  trade, demonstrated a double-digit growth. The gross GST collection reached ₹20.18 lakh crore 2 in FY24, marking 11.7 per cent increase from the previous year, underscoring robust domestic trading activity. Average daily electronic toll collection, total air passengers handled, and rail freight traffic registered a YoY growth of 18.9 per cent, 15 per cent and 5.3 per cent, respectively, in  FY24,  supporting  the  steady  growth  of  transportation  services.  However,  there  is  some catching  up  left  to  be  achieved  in  the  pre  pandemic  trend  in  the  levels  of  trade,  hotel  and transport sector, as pointed out in Box I.1 of Chapter 1 of this Survey. Bank credit and deposits expanded YoY by 20.2 per cent and 12.9 per cent, respectively, as of March 2024, suggesting continued buoyancy in financial services. The residential property market also demonstrated a promising trend in 2023, with demand and new supply experiencing double-digit growth. 3

## Box XI.1: The services sector continues to command the highest share in the number of registered companies

A total number of 16,91,495 active companies exist in India as of 31 March 2024. The services sector has the highest number of active companies (65 per cent). Within the services sector, business services has the highest number of active companies (28 per cent), followed by trading (13 per cent) and community, personal and social services (11 per cent). In FY24 alone, 1,85,312 new companies were registered, out of which 71 per cent were services sector companies. 4

A major factor driving interest in the services sector is the rising share of digitally delivered services,  which  have  seen  exponential  growth  in  global  exports.  The  rapid  formalisation of the services sector, increased demand for digital, financial, and entertainment services, integration into the global supply chain, and the availability of skilled professionals for startups are driving the sector's growth in the economy.

## Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)- Services

11.9 Business activity in the services sector in India transcended the obstacles of the pandemic and  other  disruptions  worldwide.  The  sector  picked  up  significantly  from  April  2023  and remained resilient throughout the financial year. HSBC's India Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) 5  is a widely used high-frequency indicator that supports the overall services sector growth narrative. In March 2024, services PMI soared to 61.2, marking one of the sector's most significant sales and business activity expansions in nearly 14 years.  This was primarily attributed to the latest upturn in business activity due to healthy demand conditions, efficiency gains and positive sales developments. PMI services averaged 60.3 in FY24 for the entire year compared to 57.3 in FY23. 6  As can be seen from Chart XI.6, the services PMI has remained above 50 since August 2021, implying continuous expansion for the last 35 months. The sector has continued to expand amidst dynamic market conditions.

## Trade in the services sector

11.10 Over  the  past  three  decades,  India's  export  of  services  has  seen  remarkable  growth, surpassing that of merchandise goods exports and constituting a significant portion of global exports. Post-pandemic, services exports have maintained a steady momentum and accounted for 44 per cent of India's total exports in FY24.

11.11 The weakening of global trade weighed down India's services exports during FY24, with a deceleration in growth to 4.8 per cent from 27.8 per cent a year ago. However, India ranked fifth 7  in services exports, with other countries being the European Union (excluding intra-EU trade), the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. Computer services and business services exports accounted for about 73 per cent of India's services exports and witnessed a 9.6 per cent growth YoY in FY24. The export of travel services experienced a significant growth of  24.6  per  cent  YoY,  benefitting  from  the  continued  recovery  in  tourism  post-pandemic restrictions.  On  the  contrary,  transportation  receipts  declined  by  19.1  per  cent,  primarily induced by a decrease in global freight rates, also reflected by a decline in the average Baltic Dry Index. 8 , which decreased by 3.9 per cent on a YoY basis during FY24.

11.12 Recently, the growth in the 'other business services' segment has been primarily driven by  sectors  such  as  business  and  management  consultancy,  public  relations,  engineering services, advertising, trade fair services and other technical services, including scientific and space services. India's growing reputation as the preferred destination for Global Capability

8    Baltic  Dry Index (BDI) is an index that tracks the price of transporting dry bulk cargo like cement, coal, iron ore, and grain on bulk freighters. As many of these commodities are raw materials that go into the production of  finished goods, the BDI is often considered an indicator of economic growth and production. The index is maintained by the London-based Baltic Exchange.

Centres (GCCs) by multinational corporations seeking efficiency gains and reduced business costs  has  significantly  boosted  software  and  business  services  exports.  Over  the  years,  the share of travel and business services has increased while transportation has marginally fallen. Furthermore, the pandemic has catalysed a structural shift in global demand towards digitally delivered services. Consequently, India's share in digitally delivered services exports globally increased to 6.0 per cent in 2023 from 4.4 per cent in 2019. 9

11.13 During FY24, services imports stood at USD 178.3 billion, a 2.1 per cent decrease on a YoY basis, dragged down by a reduction of global freight rates. The rise in services exports, coupled with a fall in imports, led to an increase in net services receipts on a YoY basis during FY24, which helped cushion India's current account deficit.

## FINANCING SOURCES FOR SERVICES SECTOR ACTIVITY

11.14 The services sector fulfils its financing needs domestically through credit from domestic banks and capital markets and internationally through Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and External  Commercial  Borrowings  (ECBs).  The  following  section  explores  in  detail  how  the services sector secures its financing.

## Bank credit

11.15 FY24 witnessed an upward trajectory of credit inflow in the services sector, with YoY growth rates surpassing the 20 per cent mark each month since April 2023. The financial year ended with an outstanding services sector credit of ₹45.9 lakh crore in March 2024, with a YoY growth of 22.9 per cent. 10

11.16 Credit to the services sector flowed across sub-sectors like transport operators, tourism, hotels  and  restaurants,  aviation,  professional  services,  trade,  and  commercial  real  estate. The aviation sector experienced the most significant credit inflow YoY growth of 56 per cent, attributed to increased aircraft leasing, hiring and a positive medium to long-term growth outlook.

## External Financing

11.17 The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has published the World Investment Report 2024 (WIR 2024) and has ranked India 15 th  in terms of FDI inflow (top 20 host economies) for the year 2023. As per the WIR 2024, India is the 2 nd  largest host country in terms of number of international project finance deals and 4 th  largest in terms of number of Greenfield project announcements. 11

11.18 FY24 witnessed a decline in the FDI equity inflows to the services sector (Chart XI.9), as in the case of the overall FDI equity inflows to India. Higher interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, heightened global uncertainties and rising protectionism that favour domestic sourcing have all contributed to lower FDI inflows into the sector.

a  broad spectrum, ranging from passenger transport via trains, buses, taxis, and airlines to freight transport facilitated by shipping companies, freight forwarders, and courier services. Ancillary services such as vehicle maintenance and airport ground handling further complement these transportation offerings. Logistics services are crucial in optimising supply chains. The following sections shed light on services offered in roadways, railways, waterways and airways. It may be noted that the progress in the build-up of physical infrastructure in these sectors is covered in Chapter 12 and not repeated here.

## Roadways

11.21 A considerable portion of India's cargo is transported via road. Accordingly, improving user convenience on National Highways (NH) is pivotal to enhancing overall NH quality. Toll digitisation has drastically reduced waiting times at toll plazas, from 734 seconds in 2014 to 47 seconds in 2024. Initiatives like free flow tolling through Automatic Number Plate Recognition and the Global Navigation Satellite System will enhance tolling efficiency in the future. Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) has also devised a comprehensive '4E' strategy Engineering (roads and vehicles), Enforcement, Emergency Care, and Education - to elevate road safety standards on NHs. The Government has utilised the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan portal for network planning and congestion projections, leveraging big data from e-waybills and FASTag to estimate future transportation demand and enhance logistics efficiency. The focus on development of access controlled high-speed corridors has impacted the quality of NH network. The development of expressways and economic corridors is reducing travel time significantly, thereby spurring economic development. 13  The exceptional improvements in the development of highways are detailed in the section on Road Transport in Chapter 12.

11.22 Roadway  services  in  India  face  challenges  such  as  continuous  ribbon  development along highways, slow onboarding of digital land records and long clearance cycles, leading to delays in project execution. However, the Government is proactively addressing these issues by focusing on developing access-controlled national highways and upgrading existing ones. Implementing single-window clearances is crucial for enhancing roadway services' efficiency and  effectiveness  in  India's  transportation  network.  Addressing  these  challenges  will  help realise the full potential of road infrastructure.

## Indian Railways

11.23 Indian  Railways  (IR)  hosts  many  services  to  enhance  user  experience,  efficiently manage the train system and build capacity for a Viksit Bharat. Passenger traffic originating in IR was 673 crore in FY24 (provisional actuals), increasing by about 5.2 per cent compared to  the  previous  year.  IR  carried  158.8  crore  tonnes  of  revenue-earning  freight  in  FY24 (excluding Konkan Railway Corporation Limited), showing an increase of 5.3 per cent over the previous year. The freight loadings of the railways achieved CAGR of 7.1 per cent from FY20 to FY24, with the special emphasis on capacity addition, new rolling stock and improving operational efficiencies. Further details on IR are mentioned in the section on Rail Transport in Chapter 12.

11.24 To upgrade the passenger experience, railways have introduced Wi-Fi facilities at 6108 stations, bridging the digital divide between rural and urban citizens. Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation's (IRCTC) online ticketing system has emerged as one of the largest e-commerce websites in the country and Asia Pacific, and it is easily accessible through the website, mobile app, and IRCTC authorized agents. The Freight Operations Information System comprehensively manages all facets of freight operations, encompassing booking, electronic demand registration, transfer of railway receipts, and consignment tracking. The Rail Sugam App and Freight Business Development Portal have also been created to enhance customer convenience.

11.25 IR's  train  management  system  offers  a  comprehensive  view  of  trains  running  with real-time train IDs. It contributes to train punctuality through improved planning and swift responses to emergencies. Maintenance of locomotives, coaches, and wagons has been digitised by applications such as Locomotive Asset Management, Coaching Management System, and Freight Wagon Management System software. The finance system of railways is Information Technology (IT) enabled. Bill passing is entirely electronic, with 99.9 per cent of expenditure and more than 90 per cent of revenue transactions being cashless. IR has digitised its procurement through a comprehensive IT system for material management known as the Indian Railways e-Procurement  System  and  Integrated  Material  Management  System.  Railway's  Human Resource  Management  System  provides  fully  automated  and  centralised  payroll,  pensions, employee self-service, performance appraisal, pass, eService record, provident fund, etc.

11.26 To build capacity, IR has introduced eight centralised training institutes for its personnel in diverse fields. About 6.5 lakh railway officials have undergone training in FY24. Railways has also developed railway-specific learning content on the iGOT Karmayogi platform, where over 80 per cent of its officials are onboarded, and 12 per cent are currently enrolled in at least one course.

## Ports, Waterways and Shipping

11.27 Increased decentralisation of decision-making, integration of professional expertise, and adoption of public-private partnership models have improved effectiveness and strengthened the management of ports. The port sector is leveraging the Sagar Setu application to streamline daily vessel and cargo operations, aspiring to become a central hub for all maritime engagements. Sagar Setu is also integrated with all the 13 major ports of India, along with 22 non-major ports and 28 private terminals.

11.28 There  is  a  push  for  promoting  river  cruise  tourism  on  national  waterways.  The development aimed at cargo ships also benefits tourist vessels, as improved waterways and facilities  enhance  their  operations.  Consequently,  there  has  been  a  staggering  100  per  cent surge  in  overnight  cruise  trips  during  FY24.  Lighthouses  are  also  emerging  as  significant tourist attractions. To attract visitors, development works such as museums, amphitheatres, and cafeterias at 75 lighthouses have been undertaken.

## Airways

11.29 India is the third-largest domestic aviation market and one of the fastest-growing major aviation markets globally. The aviation sector in India has shown substantial growth, with a 15 per cent YoY increase in total air passengers handled at Indian airports reaching 37.6 crore in FY24.

11.30 In FY24, the domestic air passenger traffic handled increased by 13 per cent YoY to 30.6 crore, and international air passenger traffic handled increased by 22 per cent YoY to 7 crore. The growth in international traffic was higher than domestic traffic due to the lower recovery of international connectivity in FY23 from the COVID-19 impact. As against a 98 per cent recovery in FY23 for domestic passenger traffic, the international recovery was 86 per cent compared to pre-COVID levels. Air cargo handled at Indian airports increased by 7 per cent YoY to 33.7 lakh tonnes in FY24.

11.31 The civil aviation sector in India has tremendous potential owing to growing demand, increased economic activity, tourism, higher disposable incomes, favourable demographics, and

greater penetration of aviation infrastructure. Progressive government policies further support this growth momentum. The Government has approved 21 greenfield airports nationwide and operationalised new terminal buildings to increase passenger handling capacity backed by a solid capex plan. To promote regional equity, the 'Ude Desh Ka Aam Nagrik' (UDAN) scheme 14 launched in 2016 facilitated the travel of  over  141  lakh  domestic  passengers  across  various 579 Regional Connectivity Scheme routes connecting 85 unreserved and underserved airports since its inception.

<!-- image -->

11.32 Initiatives like Digi Yatra 15  are enhancing efficiency through technology. Since its launch, more than 2.5 core passengers have benefited from this program. It is to be implemented at all airports in a phased manner.

11.33 The future of aviation services in India is anchored in the growth of the Maintenance, Repair,  and  Operations  sector  and  the  burgeoning  drone  industry.  India  aims  to  become  a global drone hub by 2030, supported by liberalised regulations and incentives. Recent progress includes  increased  training  organisations,  remote  pilot  certificates,  registered  drones,  and approved drone models. The promotion of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at GIFT City has facilitated aviation leasing and financing, exemplified by Air India's recent aircraft acquisition. As of 31 March 2024, 27 entities have registered for the aircraft leasing business, and have leased more than 20 aircrafts, indicating the sector's promising outlook.

11.34 Economic  growth  necessitates  the  growth  of  the  aviation  industry  and  the  need  for expanded airport capacity, which, in turn, brings up sustainability concerns and the need for more skilled workers. As per the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, there are approximately 10,000 pilots with various airlines in India. 16 Indian aviation sector stands out positively, with women constituting 15 per cent of the country's pilots, which is almost three times higher than

14     The objective of UDAN scheme is to connect small and medium cities with big cities through air service. Under the UDAN scheme, the airfare for a one-hour journey by a 'fixed wing aircraft' or half an hour's journey by a helicopter for about 500 km, has been fixed at (indexed to) ₹4000.

15    Digi Yatra uses facial recognition to verify passenger identities at various checkpoints, such as check-in, security, and boarding gates, without needing physical documents.

16    PIB  release  dated  23  March  2023,  Directorate  General  of  Civil  Aviation  (DGCA).  https://www.pib.gov.in/ PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1909941

the global average, thus presenting greater opportunities for women in the sector. 17   In the year 2023, a total of 1622 commercial pilot licenses were issued, of which 18 per cent were issued to women. Ministry of Civil Aviation and its associated organisations have taken steps to increase the number of pilots in the country. The Airports Authority of India issued award letters for nine  new  Flying  Training  Organisations  (FTO)  at  five  airports,  namely  Belagavi,  Jalgaon, Kalaburagi,  Khajuraho  and  Lilabari,  in  the  first  phase  and  six  more  FTOs  at  five  airports, namely Bhavnagar, Hubballi, Kadapa, Kishangarh and Salem in the second phase. 18  The sector holds  significant  potential,  requiring  collaborative  efforts  between  the  government,  industry stakeholders, and international partners. Investments in infrastructure, skill development, and sustainability initiatives will fuel the future expansion of the aviation sector in India.

## Tourism

11.35 The tourism sector in India is rapidly expanding, with India being ranked at the 39th position in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) 2024. 19 Showing positive signs of revival post-pandemic, the industry witnessed over 92 lakh foreign tourist arrivals 20 in 2023, implying a YoY increase of 43.5 per cent. India has significantly earned foreign exchange receipts amounting to over ₹2.3 lakh crore through tourism, indicating a 65.7 per cent YoY increase. India's share of foreign exchange earnings in world tourism receipts increased from 1.38 per cent in 2021 to 1.58 per cent in 2022.

20    As per the UNWTO definition, International Tourist Arrivals (ITAs) comprises two components, namely Foreign Tourist Arrivals (FTAs) and Arrivals of Non-Resident Nationals.

11.36 The  hospitality  industry  has  risen  to  meet  the  increasing  number  of  tourists'  needs and to elevate the overall guest experience. In 2023, the highest amount of new supply was created  with  the  addition  of  14,000  rooms,  bringing  the  total  inventory  of  chain-affiliated rooms to 183,000 in India. 21  Hoteliers are increasingly leveraging technology to personalise guest experiences and improve operational efficiencies. Hotels are also adopting innovative operational strategies, such as leasing or managing external restaurant, spa, and lounge brands, to capitalise on established concepts that attract hotel residents, thereby boosting revenue. 22 In FY24, the average daily rate increased from ₹6704 to ₹7616, marking a YoY growth of 13.6 per cent. 23

11.37 India  holds  enormous  potential  in  expanding  tourism,  and  several  government initiatives  support  the  sector's  progress.  Under  the  'Pilgrimage  Rejuvenation  and  Spiritual Augmentation  Drive'  (PRASHAD) 24   scheme,  29  new  sites  have  been  identified  for  tourism infrastructure development, and 12 have been inaugurated. Swadesh Darshan 2.0, focusing on integrated tourism destination development, targets 55 destinations across 32 states and Union Territories. India chaired the first Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Tourism Expert Working Group, deliberating on collaborative strategies among SCO member nations. The Ministry organised the 11 th  International Tourism Mart and Bharat Parv 2023 to promote tourism  and  cultural  exchange.  Alongside  these  efforts,  the  Government  has  implemented various measures to support the tourism industry, including policy reforms and infrastructure development.

11.38 The  tourism  sector  has  embraced  the  digital  revolution.  One  such  initiative  is E-Marketplace,  designed  to  facilitate  interactions  between  tourists  and  certified  tourist facilitators  and  guides  through  web  and  mobile  applications.  The  Union  Government,  in collaboration  with  State  Governments  and  Union  Territory  administrations,  is  actively working on registering accommodation units nationwide in the National Integrated Database of Hospitality Industry (NIDHI) portal. This database will aid in formulating effective policies and strategies for promoting tourism. Another noteworthy initiative is SAATHI (System for Assessment, Awareness and Training for Hospitality Industry), which aims to prevent further transmission of viruses by educating the hospitality industry on government COVID regulations.

11.39 India's  travel  and  tourism  (T&amp;T)  sector  has  been  influenced  by  global  inflationary pressures and delays in the recovery of T&amp;T capacity, similar to other economies. However, the  decline  in  price  competitiveness  since  2021  has  been  minimal  compared  to  its  peers, with only a 0.7 per cent drop. India's decline is particularly slight at just 0.1 per cent from 2021 levels, which reflects the Government's consistent efforts to maintain stability despite the slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. WEF's TTDI 2024 report emphasizes the need for improvements in tourist services and infrastructure, and the development of a skilled workforce. In a challenging environment for employment generation in services due to the rise of AI and manufacturing due to rising protectionism, transportation costs and supply concerns, the tourism sector represents a relatively low-hanging fruit for job creation. India has to seize the  opportunity.  To  formalise  employment  within  this  sector,  the  Ministry  of  Tourism  has initiated the Incredible India Tourism Facilitator Certificate Programme 27 . This program aims to create a skilled cadre of tourist facilitators nationwide through a digital platform that offers online learning opportunities and certification courses. 28

## Real Estate

11.40  Real estate and ownership of dwellings have accounted for over seven per cent of the overall GVA in the past decade, highlighting their integral role in the economy. Following two challenging  years  of  pandemic-induced  lockdowns  and  economic  instability,  the  real  estate sector has experienced a robust recovery. The pandemic has shifted homebuyers' preferences toward  larger,  sustainable  spaces  with  additional  amenities,  driven  by  remote  and  hybrid working trends. This shift has also spurred interest in peripheral areas close to city centres. Factors contributing to the sector's growth include rapid urbanisation, rising income levels, the emergence of nuclear families, new entrants in the market, and improved financial options for developers and homebuyers. The strong desire for home-ownership was reinforced during the pandemic, acting as a catalyst.

11.41 In 2023, residential real estate sales in India were at their highest since 2013, witnessing a 33 per cent YoY growth, with a total sale of 4.1 lakh units in the top eight cities. The new supply witnessed an all-time high, with 5.2 lakh units launched in 2023, as against 4.3 lakh units in 2022. The momentum continued in Q1 of 2024, witnessing record-breaking sales of 1.2 lakh units, clocking a robust 41 per cent YoY growth. New supply has consistently exceeded one lakh units since Q2 of 2022, underscoring persistent demand-supply dynamics in the housing market. 29

11.42 Further, the rising demand for housing loans reflects the underlying demand for real estate.  Housing  loans  as  a  percentage  of  GDP  increased  from  FY12  to  FY24  (Chart  XI.18). Traditionally,  banks  have  been  the  most  significant  players  in  the  housing  finance  sector. However, Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) have significantly contributed to this landscape over the years. They played a complementary role with banks in providing housing credit to the bottom of the pyramid. The share of outstanding housing loans as a percentage of total loans of HFCs stood at 70.8 per cent as of 31 March 2024.

<!-- image -->

11.43 The housing sector's growth has been due to several key factors. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U), launched in 2015, has sanctioned over 1.2 crore houses for urban beneficiaries, ensuring durable housing. Policy reforms like the Goods and Services Tax, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, and the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code have boosted  transparency  and  investor  confidence  in  real  estate.  Initiatives  like  the  Affordable Housing  Fund  and  Special  Window  for  Affordable  and  Mid-Income  Housing  (SWAMIH) Investment Fund have supported affordable housing projects. PMAY(U)-Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme interest subvention has been a primary demand-side driver, with the National Housing Bank (NHB) releasing ₹49,460.1 crore in subsidies benefiting over 21.1 lakh households by March  2024.  The  co-lending  model,  combining  bank  liquidity  with  HFCs',  aims  to  extend housing credit to a broader segment, including low-income groups. The Urban Infrastructure Development Fund, managed by NHB with an initial corpus of ₹10,000 crore, is expected to improve urban infrastructure, attracting real estate investment.

## Box XI.2: Building Trust: How RERA is Reshaping Real Estate

The  Real  Estate  (Regulation  &amp;  Development)  Act,  2016  (RERA),  was  enacted  to  bring about much-needed reform in India's real estate sector. The main objective of RERA is to encourage  greater  transparency,  citizen-centricity,  accountability,  and  financial  discipline, thus empowering home buyers and boosting the economy. All States/ Union Territories (UTs) have notified rules under RERA except Nagaland, which is in the process of notifying the rules.

## Key measures and outcomes from RERA's implementation

-  Developer Accountability: Developers frequently failed to deliver promised project features, layouts, and amenities, thereby misleading homebuyers. RERA now mandates an  'Agreement  to  Sale'  at  the  time  of  registration  and  requires  two-thirds  consent from allottees/homebuyers for any layout changes. RERA also specifies provisions for refund, compensation, and penalties applicable to all stakeholders in cases of obligation contraventions.
-  Fair  Transactions: Before  RERA  was  enacted,  there  were  many  cases  of  builders not delivering flats or homes despite full payments from homebuyers.  To address this, under RERA, it is mandated that 70 per cent of funds collected from homebuyers for a project must be maintained in a separate bank account dedicated to project construction and land costs.
-  Disclosures  and  Mandatory  Registration: RERA  has  also  made  it  mandatory for developers and project promoters to make all necessary disclosures about projects, including permissions secured from authorities, date of launch, promised date of delivery, project specifications, and amenities. 30  Further, homebuyers' interests are protected as only the projects (above 500 square metres and above eight apartments) registered with RERA can be launched, thereby obviating the possibility of any misrepresentation or false promises by the developers. 31 As of 01 July 2024, over 1,30,186 real estate projects and 88,461 real estate agents have been registered under RERA.

31    PIB  release  dated  01  November  2021,  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban  Affairs.  https://static.pib.gov.in/ WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2021/nov/doc202111121.pdf

-  Dispute  Resolution: RERA provides  for  the  establishment  of  a  fast-track  dispute resolution mechanism for the settlement of disputes. As of 01 July 2024, 32 States and UTs have set up the Real Estate Regulatory Authority, and 1,24,947 complaints have already been disposed of.

After the enactment of RERA, India is ranked 36th in the Global Real Estate Transparency Index in 2022.

11.44 The outlook for the real estate sector is encouraging. With increasing urbanisation, the housing industry is poised for a significant transformation. As per the United Nations, by 2050, half of India's population is projected to dwell in urban regions, compared to 31 per cent in 2011. 32  This underscores the need to adapt strategies and policies to meet the rising demand for housing and offer viable, cost-effective, sustainable solutions.

11.45 Digitisation  of  land  records  is  poised  to  improve  transparency  in  land  transactions, diminish  property  ownership  conflicts,  and  enhance  the  efficiency  of  land  management. Implementing a single-window clearance system for construction approvals will also accelerate construction processes, minimising delays and uncertainties. The streamlining of approvals is set to consolidate and systematise India's residential real estate sector further.

11.46 The legacy stalled real estate projects is a challenge. Approximately 4.1 lakh stressed dwelling  units,  involving  ₹4.1  lakh  crore,  are  affected,  as  estimated  by  the  Indian  Banks' Association  (IBA).  The  Ministry  of  Housing  and  Urban  Affairs  (MoHUA)  established  a committee  to  recommend  solutions  for  completing  stalled  projects  to  address  this  issue. 33 The committee identified the primary cause of stress as lack of financial viability, resulting in cost overruns and delays. Its recommendations include mandatory project registrations with RERA, execution of registration and sub-lease deeds for occupied units, ensuring possession of  substantially completed projects, proposing state government rehabilitation packages for promoter-led  resolutions,  establishing  frameworks  for  RERA  and  administrator-led  project revivals, financing stalled projects, and utilising IBC as a last resort for resolving projects.

11.47 According to a report by Crisil, the housing loan market in India grew at a CAGR of approximately 13 per cent from FY18 to FY23. It is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 13 to 15 per cent reaching ₹42 lakh crore to ₹44 lakh crore by FY26. NHB has introduced a  Residential  Mortgage-Backed  Securities  (RMBS)  platform  to  address  funding  options limitations. This platform aims to attract long-term resources from diverse investor groups, including Pension Funds and Insurance Funds, to support the expansion of housing finance and deepen the debt market for primary mortgages. The RMBS platform will help reduce assetliability mismatches for lending institutions, ensuring adequate liquidity in the housing finance sector.

11.48 Going forward, the demand for housing is expected to be driven by affordability and increased access to credit. As of March 2024, the shares of Southern, Western and Northern states in the individual housing loans outstanding are 35.4 per cent, 31.2 per cent and 26.2 per cent, respectively. The Eastern States at 6.9 per cent and the eight North-eastern and Hilly states combining to 0.95 per cent share present an opportunity for undertaking initiatives for improving penetration.

11.49 Sustainability and technology have emerged as significant disrupters for the real estate sector. Sustainability will influence green construction practices and energy-efficient designs, while technology will revolutionise smart homes and data-driven insights. With more significant environmental concerns, the focus will be on energy-efficient systems, rainwater harvesting and smart building technologies.

## Information Technology Services, Tech start-ups and Global Capability centres

## Information Technology (IT) services

11.50 Over  the  past  decade,  information  and  computer-related  services  have  become increasingly significant, with their share of total GVA rising from 3.2 per cent in FY13 to 5.9 per cent in FY23. Despite the pandemic-induced economic downturn, this sector achieved a real growth rate of 10.4 per cent in FY21. The COVID-19 pandemic expedited the advancement and uptake of technology-driven solutions, fuelling the growth of this sector. The IT and ITenabled services have been instrumental in maintaining the country's external balance through export earnings, which are set to increase further. The flourishing growth of IT services has also supported the expansion of Global Capability Centres (GCCs) and the tech start-up ecosystem in India.

## Global Capability Centres

11.51 Global Capability Centres (GCCs) in India have grown significantly, from over 1,000 centres  in  FY15  to  more  than  1,580  centres,  with  over  2,740  units  by  FY23.  These  centres contribute  to  economic  growth  by  providing  high-quality  employment.  In  FY23,  the  total talent employed in Indian GCCs exceeded 16.6 lakh. Of this workforce, over 42 per cent are engaged in engineering, research, and development (ER&amp;D), 34.5 per cent in business process management (BPM), and 23.4 per cent in IT services. The software, internet and banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI) sectors collectively account for about 58 per cent of India's IT GCC talent. Revenue from India's GCCs has increased from USD 19.4 billion in FY15 to USD 46 billion in FY23, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.4 per cent.

<!-- image -->

11.52 As  per  National  Association  of  Software  and  Service  Companies (NASSCOM),  the  key drivers for the growth of ER&amp;D in India include strategic long-term partnerships, extensive digitalisation, and the adoption of cloud technologies. The IT services segment has expanded due to  increased demand for application modernisation, cloud migration, platform development, and enhanced cybersecurity measures. The BPM sector in Indian GCCs has grown by transitioning from traditional services to more intelligent operations and data-driven solutions.

11.53 The technology sectors are dynamic and continually evolving, making them lucrative for employees and businesses. IT positions remain among the most in-demand roles in the global job market. Despite the high demand, these sectors are experiencing a talent gap, with a shortage of IT, data science, and cybersecurity workers. As per a survey 34 , for Q3 2024, 76 per cent of IT employers reported difficulty in finding the skilled talent required globally. To incentivise GCCs in India, promoting specialisations in higher education is essential. Focus areas  should  include  Blockchain,  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI),  Machine  Learning,  Internet of  Things, Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, Big Data Analytics, Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, 3D Printing, and Web and Mobile Development.

11.54 Several  initiatives  are  in  place  to  bridge  the  talent  gap.  Conceived  as  a  first-of-itskind initiative, 'Future Skills PRIME', which is a joint initiative by Ministry of Electronics &amp; Information Technology (MeitY) and NASSCOM, aims to create an up-skilling and re-skilling ecosystem in focus areas to facilitate the continuous enhancement of skills of IT professionals in line with their aspirations and aptitude. 35 The Government initiated a Digital Skilling program in emerging and future technologies, aiming to skill, reskill, and upskill one crore students through internships, apprenticeships, and employment opportunities. 36  Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas

## Technology start-ups in India

11.55 The  COVID-19  pandemic  fuelled  consumer  and  enterprise  demand  for  technologybacked solutions. The number of technology start-ups in India rose remarkably from around 2,000 in 2014 to approximately 31,000 in 2023. As per NASSCOM, the sector witnessed the inception of roughly 1000 new tech start-ups in 2023.

11.56 The top sectors for start-ups in 2023 were EdTech (16 per cent), EnterpriseTech (12 per cent), BFSI (10 per cent), Advertising and Marketing (7 per cent), RetailTech (6 per cent), Media and Entertainment (5 per cent), ConsumerTech (5 per cent), Professional services (4 per cent) and Gaming (4 per cent).

11.57 Several factors have contributed to the rise of start-ups in various sectors. Changes in consumption patterns and increased internet penetration paved the way for retail tech startups. The BFSI sector saw a surge in start-ups starting in 2016, driven by significant events such as the introduction of UPI. The demand for scalable and efficient cloud solutions led to the growth of Software as a Service (SaaS) start-ups, resulting in 21 unicorns since 2014. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated growth in sectors like HealthTech and EdTech, spurred by the increased need for tele-consulting and remote learning solutions.

11.58 As  per  NASSCOM,  India's  tech  start-up  ecosystem  ranks  third  globally  and  has performed considerably better than the USA and the UK. 39  The strength of the Indian tech start-up ecosystem lies in its large pool of start-ups, unicorns, and ability to scale. With 16 per cent of the world's AI talent, India positions itself as an innovation hub, showcasing rapid adoption of AI skills.

11.59 The  Start-up  India  Initiative  and  Start-up  hubs  across  ministries  and  departments of the Government of India have aided the growth of tech start-ups. Some other significant initiatives are the National Deep Tech Start-up Policy, the Drone Shakti Program and custom duty exemptions for EV-related capital goods and machinery. Targeted efforts undertaken to tap this start-up potential further are elaborated below.

-  Accelerating and strengthening the deep-tech ecosystem: As of 31 March 2024, there  are  more  than  1.25  lakh  DPIIT-recognized  start-ups  spanning  across  all  sectors of the economy, out of which there are over 13,000 start-ups that cover sectors like AI, Internet of Things, Robotics, and Nanotechnology. The draft National Deep Tech Start-up Policy (NDTSP) 40  is a comprehensive framework to tackle deep tech start-ups' challenges.

37    Industry  4.0  is  a  term  given  to  the  current  trend  of  automation,  interconnectivity  and  data  exchange  in manufacturing technologies to increase productivity.

## Telecommunications

11.60 Telecommunication  is  the  gateway  to  the  fast-paced  growth  of  digital  services  in India. The overall teledensity (number of telephones per 100 population) in India increased from 75.2 per cent in March 2014 to 85.7 per cent in March 2024. 43   The number of wireless telephone connections stood at 116.5 crore at the end of March 2024. The Government has placed considerable emphasis on the growth of internet and broadband as part of the Digital India campaign. As a result, internet subscribers jumped from 25.1 crore in March 2014 to 95.4 crore in March 2024, of whom 91.4 crore are accessing the internet via wireless phones. The internet density also increased to 68.2 per cent in March 2024. The cost of data has declined substantially, vastly improving the average wireless data usage per subscriber.

11.61 5G services were first launched in India in October 2022. Currently, India is amongst the fastest-growing 5G networks in the world. After the launch of 5G services, India's international rank in mobile broadband speed has improved from 118 to 15 (March 2024). The '5G Test Bed', dedicated to the nation in 2022, provides an end-to-end testing facility, enabling R&amp;D teams in Indian academia and industry to validate their products, prototypes, and algorithms and demonstrate various services. The Bharat 5G Portal propels India's 5G capabilities and fosters innovation, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing within the telecom sector.

11.62 Based  on  the  recommendations  of  the  Technology  Innovation  Group  on  6G,  the Bharat 6G Vision document was launched in March 2023 to develop and deploy 6G network technologies in India. It also led to the constitution of Bharat 6G Mission and an Apex Council to  lay  down  the  Phase-wise  objectives  of  the  6G  Mission.  The  Bharat  6G  Alliance  was  also launched in July 2023 as a collaborative platform of public and private companies, academia, research institutions and standards development organisations to enable India to become a leading global supplier of IP, products and solutions of affordable 5G, 6G and other future telecom solutions.

11.63 The  Amended  BharatNet  Program  is  now  being  rolled  out  to  provide  broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats in the country. As of 31 March, 2024, 6,83,175 kilometers of Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) has been laid, connecting a total of 2,06,709 Gram Panchayats (GPs) by OFC in the BharatNet phase I &amp; II.

11.64 The  Government  has  also  implemented  multiple  structural  and  procedural  reforms to promote healthy competition, reduce the regulatory burden on telecom service providers, and  protect  consumers'  interests.  These  include  rationalising  the  definition  of  adjusted gross revenue, spectrum-related reforms like allowing sharing and trading of spectrum and rationalising spectrum usage charges, permission for 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the telecom sector under automatic route subject to safeguards, etc. The Telecommunications Act  2023  amends  and  consolidates  the  laws  relating  to  telecommunication  services  and telecommunication networks, assignment of spectrum, etc.

11.65 Telecommunication  technology  development  requires  significantly  large  and  patient capital  for  R&amp;D  and  commercialisation.  To  address  this,  the  Government  has  decided  that

43    Press Release No.36 dated 04 July 2024. Telecom Regulatory Authority of India https://www.trai.gov.in/sites/ default/files/PR\_No.36of2024.pdf

an  allocation  of  5  per  cent  of  annual  collections  from  the  Universal  Services  Obligation Fund 44  (USOF) would be made available for funding R&amp;D in the telecom sector. The Telecom Technology  Development  Fund  formulated  in  2022  has  seen  significant  participation  from start-ups, MSMEs, academia and industry.

- 11.66 New  courses  have  been  suggested  to  align  engineering  programs  in  electronics  and communications with evolving needs in the industry. Skill courses related to 5G and 5G-enabled technology have been approved by the National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET). All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) has also included 5G as a thrust area in the AICTE Training and Learning Academy scheme for the faculty development program.
- 11.67 Sanchar Saathi portal 45 , launched in May 2023, is a citizen-centric initiative to empower mobile subscribers, strengthen their security and increase awareness. Sanchar Saathi portal has several components, including the Chakshu facility, launched in March 2024, to report suspected fraud communications. Based on complaints received, appropriate actions are being taken.

## E-Commerce

11.68  The Indian e-commerce industry is expected to cross USD 350 billion by 2030. The Indian retail market is largely unorganised. However, over the next 3 to 5 years, the share of modern retail (including e-commerce) will increase to 30-35 per cent of the total retail. 46

- 11.69 India's  e-commerce  market  has  gained  significant  momentum  during  the  past  few years owing to technological advancements, evolving new-age business models coupled with government initiatives like the Digital India program, UPI, One District - One Product (ODOP) initiative, Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC), new foreign trade policy, relaxation in FDI limits and Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) (Amendment) Rules 2021. At the heart of the rapid expansion of e-commerce is the diversity of benefits the e-marketplace offers sellers and consumers compared to traditional brick-and-mortar markets.

11.70 The rise of e-commerce is constrained by inadequate skills required for online selling, such as cataloguing. Data privacy issues and increasing online fraud have turned out to be the most significant hurdle in the growth of e-commerce in India. It becomes imperative to educate users on the safe use of e-commerce platforms. For starters, the Government has implemented several initiatives to ensure the safe use of e-commerce platforms. Key regulations include the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020, to safeguard consumers from unfair trade practices in e-commerce and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, ensuring digital platform accountability. The Digital Personal Data  Protection  Act,  2023  provides  a  comprehensive  data  protection  framework,  further safeguarding consumer information.

44    The Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) aims to provide quality and affordable mobile and digital services across the rural and remote areas of the country, allowing non-discriminatory access to mobile and network services  along  with  equitable  access  to  knowledge  and  information  dissemination,  leading  to  rapid  socioeconomic development with improved standard of living.

11.71 To raise awareness, the Government runs the Jago Grahak Jago campaign, providing consumers  with  information  on  their  rights  and  safe  e-commerce  practices.  The  National Consumer  Helpline  (NCH)  offers  guidance  and  resolves  consumer  grievances. 47   Various consumer awareness programs, including digital literacy workshops and cyber safety sessions, are organised in collaboration with NGOs and educational institutions. Additionally, interactive sessions and webinars with experts and officials keep consumers informed about the latest trends and safety measures in the e-commerce sector.

11.72 The buyer ecosystem in India is evolving at a very sharp rate, and business models will need to innovate to serve the needs of a diverse shopper base regarding service expectations, price  sensitivity  and  language  requirements.  Local  language  platforms  are  needed  as  the shopper base expands to tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Growing start-ups and innovative social media platforms provide an opportunity to test unique business models that might be targeted to specific demographic cohorts. 48  E-commerce's future is built on the enhanced user experience through AI, seamless digital payment methods, innovations like UPI, and business engineering data analytics for business operations and enhancements. Further, platforms such as ONDC and Government e-Marketplace (GeM) increase the outreach of e-commerce capabilities.

## Box XI.3: ONDC- Democratising Digital Commerce

Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) is a pioneering initiative of the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, aimed to democratise digital commerce and enable small businesses to capitalise on the benefits of digital commerce by creating a level playing field. The ONDC network is premised on the fundamentals of unbundling and making various components of digital commerce interoperable. ONDC started in January 2022 and rapidly expanded its twin domains of mobility and food and beverage to various domains like  grocery,  fashion,  beauty  and  personal  care,  home  and  kitchen,  on-network logistics, agriculture, gift cards, Farmer Producers Organisations (FPOs) and artisanal works.

## CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES

11.73 This  section  summarises  the  challenges  and  growth  opportunities  that  cut  across different segments of services, presented in different sections above.

-  The rapid digitisation in the services sector necessitates a skilled workforce to keep pace with technological advancements. However, there is a gap in the availability of workers with relevant digital and high-tech skills. The Government has been focusing on skill development initiatives through programs like Skill India and the National Education Policy to equip the workforce with the necessary skills. Upskilling in the technology sector via an ecosystem fostered by government initiatives in collaboration with industry can help India emerge as a high-value partner specialising in areas such as cybersecurity, enterprise management, financial risk management and insurance.
-  In recognition of the importance of logistics and transport services for economic activity, several initiatives have been undertaken to ease infrastructure bottlenecks, logistics costs, and regulatory compliances. Additionally, leveraging India's extensive coastline and river network for  enhanced  services  such  as  port  operations  and  inland  waterways  promises significant  potential  to  streamline  transportation  routes,  reduce  costs,  and  improve efficiency. The Netherlands boasts Europe's densest network of inland waterways, covering approximately  6,000  kilometres  of  rivers  and  canals.  These  waterways  serve  various purposes, including drainage and navigation. Key commercial routes (Class IV and higher), totalling 2,200 kilometres, handle about 40 per cent of international freight movements and 20 per cent of domestic freight within the country. 49  Kerala's use of its backwaters for  tourism,  commerce,  and  transportation,  particularly  the  Kochi  Water  Metro,  which is  expected  to  benefit  33,000  islanders,  highlights  the  potential  of  inland  waterways. 50 Adopting similar strategies nationwide can enhance India's inland water transport system, support sustainable growth, and ease congestion.
-  Accessing  finance  can  pose  difficulties,  particularly  for  small  and  medium  enterprises operating in the services sector. 51  Several initiatives, such as Mudra Yojana, Start-up India and Stand-up India, have been implemented to ease credit accessibility. Building on these efforts, focusing on streamlining loan processes, expanding the outreach of credit guarantee schemes,  adopting  alternative  credit  appraisal  methods,  and  innovating  supply  chain financing can further augment credit flow to the sector. Governments at appropriate levels may also set up agencies to assist in project documentation and to improve the bankability of projects.
-  The regulatory landscape in the services sector, which used to be complex, is undergoing positive  transformations.  Initiatives  like  GST  simplification,  Start-up  India,  and  sectorspecific policies such as the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act are fostering a more conducive business environment.  Further enhancing the simplification of procedures

through single-window systems, streamlining legal provisions, and digitising government processes at all administrative levels can significantly boost economic efficiency.

-  Data  privacy  and  cybersecurity  have  become  critical  concerns  with  the  increasing digitisation of services. Given this, the Government is spearheading data protection laws and cybersecurity policies to safeguard consumer data and strengthen cybersecurity measures in the services sector. To further embrace technology with confidence, ensuring the adoption of strong security measures, compliance with privacy regulations, and fostering innovation in security technologies are essential.

## CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD

11.74 Historically, India's services sector has thrived on low-cost offerings. The digitisation of services, coupled with appropriate policy nudges, kept progressively transforming the nature of service delivery almost irreversibly during the early part of the last decade. This trend accelerated post the pandemic. Another distinct pattern that emerged during the last three years is that the contact-intensive business and personal services-prominently trade, transport, real estate and their ancillary services - that underwent a steep decline during the pandemic are recovering, embedding greater technology and digital content in them. At the same time, India's services exports are diversifying beyond software to include Human Resources (HR), legal, and design services  in  line  with  emerging  global  demands.  Thus,  two  significant  transformations  are reshaping India's services landscape: the rapid technology-driven transformation of domestic service delivery and the diversification of India's services exports.

11.75 The country is emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres. Domestically, start-ups drive innovation, improving access to credit, raw materials, and markets. Aided by the deep technology ecosystem and the consistent policy push, many technology start-ups are digitising manufacturing and other services. The embedded service content of the non-service economic activities  has  increased  significantly,  as  evidenced  by  the  National  Accounts  Statistics.  The post-production  value  addition  in  activities  is  also  increasingly  dependent  on  services  like e-commerce, innovative packaging and advertisement and modern logistics services.

11.76 As India looks forward to creating millions of jobs by 2030, dovetailing this transformation in the demand-supply dynamics of services is pivotal to meeting the hiring requirements in the medium term. The emerging job demands in the services sector entail greater and more focussed  skills.  The  World  Economic  Forum's  report 52   highlights  an  increasing  focus  on cognitive abilities (like complex problem-solving and creative thinking), digital literacy, and proficiency in AI and big data. This shift underscores the strategic imperative for businesses and the workforce to adapt to technological advancements and meet global market demands. Focus areas should include blockchain, AI, machine learning, Internet of Things, cybersecurity, cloud computing, big data analytics, augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D printing, and web and mobile development. Thus, the immediate task of the skilling programme in India is to

52    World Economic Forum. (2023). WEF Future of Jobs 2023 (Page 7). https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF\_ Future\_of\_Jobs\_2023.pdf

plan and equip itself to meet these requirements adequately. A report by Capital Economics argues that AI could lead to a slowing down of India's services export growth, cutting it by 0.30.4 percentage points a year over the next decade. 53  This only underscores the importance of the relatively less skill-dependent tourism sector for employment generation. Therefore, public policy should pay particular attention to boosting the tourism sector. Governments at all levels and the private sector must work together to realise the sector's potential. 54

11.77 In the short run, tentative global economic outlook and commodity price uncertainties present a serious challenge to input costs and demand for services 55 . Thus, sustaining positive demand trends and effectively managing rising costs and competitive pressures will be critical for  the  services  sector's  continued  growth  and  resilience  in  the  upcoming  year.  The  postpandemic dynamism shown by the economy and the services sector, in particular, should help transcend these uncertainties and challenges.

55    As per the latest Supply and Use Tables for 2019-20 published by the Central Statistics Office, bulk of the inputs used in the production of services in India originate from commodity-producing (agricultural and industrial) sectors. So, pressure on commodity prices can significantly affect the input cost of services and, hence, their demand.
