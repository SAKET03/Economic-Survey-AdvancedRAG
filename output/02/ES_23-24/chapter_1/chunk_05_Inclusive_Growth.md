## INCLUSIVE GROWTH

## Shift in the approach to welfare

1.47  India's  social  welfare  approach  has  undergone  a  shift  from  an  input-based  approach to  outcome-based  empowerment.  Saturation  of  basic  necessities  has  been  recognised  as imperative to achieve this, thus impelling an array of flagship initiatives. Government initiatives like providing free-of-cost gas connections under PM Ujjwala Yojana, building toilets under

the Swacch Bharat Mission, opening bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana, building pucca houses under PM-AWAS Yojana have improved capabilities and enhanced opportunities for the underprivileged sections.

1.48  The approach also involves the targeted implementation of reforms for last-mile service delivery to truly realise the maxim of 'no person left behind'. These include the Aspirational Districts Programme, launched in 2018, for focusing efforts on the most backward regions, the success of which inspired the Aspirational Blocks Programme launched in 2023; the Vibrant Villages  Programme  for  border  areas;  and  more  recently,  the  Viksit  Bharat  Sankalp  Yatra, which saw the participation of 15 crore people in two months starting 15 November 2023 41 . The digitisation of healthcare, education and governance helps improve the gains for every rupee spent. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme and Jan Dhan Yojana-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity have been boosters of fiscal  efficiency  and  minimisation  of  leakages,  with  â‚¹36.9  lakh  crore having been transferred via DBT since its inception in 2013 (DBT Portal. 42 ).

1.49  On the employment  front,  according  to the annual  PLFS,  the all-India  annual unemployment rate (persons aged 15 years and above, as per usual status) has been declining since the pandemic. This has been accompanied by a rise in the labour force participation rate and worker-to-population ratio. Even by the relatively strict standards of current weekly status, employment has recovered from the  pandemic  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  From  the  gender perspective, the female labour force participation rate has been rising for six years, i.e., from 23.3 per cent in 2017-18 to 37 per cent in 2022-23, driven mainly by the rising participation of rural women.

1.50  As a result of the systematic focus on addressing individual deprivations, the incidence of poverty has reduced remarkably. This is reflected in the steep decline in the headcount ratio of multidimensionally poor between 2015-16 and 2022-23, as per NITI Aayog's discussion paper on multidimensional poverty in India 43 .

1.51 The initiatives in the social sector have also translated into rising consumption spending, as evident from the results of the latest Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2022-23. The HCES throws many reassuring findings on inclusive growth in the past decade. The monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in 2022-23 increased in real terms in both rural and urban areas over 2011-12. The difference between rural and urban MPCE also declined in percentage terms.
