# Macroeconomic Stability Safeguards Growth

## MACROECONOMIC STABILITY SAFEGUARDS GROWTH

1.21  For India, FY23 began with multiple challenges. Spillovers from the conflict in Europe were stoking domestic price pressures and widening the current account deficit (CAD) through increased  oil  prices.  Central  banks  in  several  countries  began  raising  policy  rates  to  battle inflationary  pressures,  leading  to  significant  uncertainty  in  AEs  and  EMEs  alike.  However, throughout  FY23  and  FY24,  the  focus  on  macroeconomic  stability  was  vital  in  securing economic growth amidst domestic and external vulnerabilities.

## Improving Public Finances

## Consolidation of Union Government Finances

1.22  Against the global trend of widening fiscal deficit and increasing debt burden, India has remained on the course of fiscal consolidation. The favourable fiscal performance in 2023, emerged as the cornerstone of India's macroeconomic stability. The fiscal deficit of the Union Government has been brought down from 6.4 per cent of GDP in FY23 to 5.6 per cent of GDP in FY24, according to provisional actuals (PA) data released by the Office of Controller General of Accounts (CGA). Strong growth in direct and indirect taxes on account of resilient economic activity  and  increased  compliance  meant  that  the  tax  revenues  generated  exceeded  the conservative budgetary estimates. Additionally, higher-than-budgeted non-tax revenue in the form of dividends from the RBI has buffeted revenue receipts. In combination with restrained revenue expenditure, these buoyant revenues ensured lower deficits. A decomposition of the fiscal deficit over the past few years reveals that with a narrowing revenue deficit, a larger share of the fiscal deficit is being accounted for by capital outlay. This suggests that the productivity of borrowed resources has improved.

## Buoyancy in revenues continues in FY24

1.23  Significant fiscal consolidation post-pandemic could be achieved largely due to buoyant revenues. Revenue receipts of the union government consisting of tax revenue (net to centre) and non-tax revenue (NTR) increased YoY by 14.5 per cent in FY24 (PA), with robust growth in both tax and non-tax revenues.

1.24  The  growth  in  gross  tax  revenue  (GTR)  was  estimated  to  be  13.4  per  cent  in  FY24, translating into tax revenue buoyancy of 1.4. The growth was led by a 15.8 per cent growth in direct taxes and a 10.6 per cent increase in indirect taxes over FY23. Broadly, 55 per cent of GTR accrued from direct taxes and the remaining 45 per cent from indirect taxes. The increased contribution of direct taxes to GTR over the years has been in line with the government's effort to enhance progressivity in taxation. The efficiency of tax collection has increased over time, reflected in the cost of collection of direct taxes declining from 0.66 per cent of gross collections in FY20 to 0.51 per cent in FY23 26 .

1.25  The increase in indirect taxes in FY24 was mainly driven by a 12.7 per cent growth in GST collection. GST E-way bill generated has also registered an uptick post-pandemic. The increase has been equally pronounced for both intra-state trade and inter-state trade. The increase in GST collection and E-way bill generation reflects increased compliance over time.

<!-- image -->

1.26  Over  the  last  seven  years,  GST  has  matured  significantly  through  streamlining  of procedures and, in the process, enhancing tax buoyancy for the Union and State governments. There have been calls for further rationalisation of rate structure to compress the number of rates, elimination of rate inversions, introduction of broad-band rates for similar products and expanding the tax base. Demands also relate to differentiating between serious and less serious offences,  spreading  awareness  among  taxpayers  regarding  common  mistakes,  encouraging voluntary compliance and expediting the resolution of disputes. 27

1.27  Within non-debt capital receipts, the proceeds from the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), which was announced in the Union Budget FY22, are gaining traction. The NMP listed core assets of union government ministries and public sector enterprises with a potential of ₹6 lakh crore for monetisation over the four-year period of FY22 - FY25. During FY22 - FY24, receipts worth ₹3.9 lakh crore have been recorded as against a target of ₹4.3 lakh crore. 28  The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways and the Ministry of Coal contributed ₹97 thousand crore out of proceeds worth ₹1.6 lakh crore in FY24. The National Highways Authority of India has identified and published an indicative list of 33 assets to be monetised in FY25. This will help improve capital allocation by investors while aiding the government in its pursuit of fiscal consolidation.

## Trends in Central Government Expenditure

1.28  The government has followed a path of fiscal consolidation while continuing to protect the vulnerable sections and investing in the productive capacity of the economy. Successive

budgets moderated the growth in revenue expenditure. While achieving the compression in revenue expenditure as a per cent of GDP, the government also ensured that free food grains are provided to 81.4 crore people in the country. At the same time, shares of total expenditure allotted  to  capital  spending  were  progressively  enhanced,  thereby  improving  the  quality of  expenditure.  Government expenditure in FY24 continued this trend whereby, as per the provisional actuals, total expenditure declined to 15.0 per cent of GDP from 17.7 per cent in FY21.

## Capex has lifted the productive potential of the economy; time for the private sector to take the baton

1.29 The PA show that capital expenditure for FY24 stood at ₹9.5 lakh crore, an increase of 28.2 per cent on a YoY basis, and was 2.8 times the level of FY20. The Government's thrust on capex has been a critical driver of economic growth amidst an uncertain and challenging global environment.

1.30  The  focus  of  capex  has  been  broad-based.  Spending  in  sectors  such  as  road  transport and highways, railways, defence services, and telecommunications delivers higher and longer impetuses to growth by addressing logistical bottlenecks and expanding productive capacities. Government capex has also begun to crowd in private investment, as discussed earlier in this chapter. Additionally, the Government continues to disburse grants-in-aid for the creation of capital assets to the states, thereby incentivising them to increase their productive spending.

1.31 At this juncture, it is important to note that while it remains the government's responsibility to facilitate the development of infrastructure and address logistical challenges, it is incumbent upon the private sector to take forward the momentum in capital formation on its own and in partnership with the Government. Between FY19 and FY23, the share of private non-financial corporations in overall GFCF increased only by 0.8 percentage points from 34.1 per cent to 34.9 per cent. This was mostly driven by their fast-increasing share in the additional stock of dwellings, other buildings and structures. Their share in addition to the capital stock in terms of machinery and equipment, started growing robustly only since FY22, a trend that needs to be sustained on the strength of their improving bottom-line and balance sheets in order to generate high-quality jobs.

## Revenue expenditure growth remains restrained

1.32  The  PA  show  that  total  expe nditure  for  FY24  is  lower  by  ₹60.6  thousand  crore  as compared to the budgeted estimates. However, these lower-than-budgeted estimates have not resulted in compromises on important areas of revenue spending, such as rural development and  education,  where  allocation  is  significantly  higher  than  budgeted  estimates.  Efficient expenditure management, aided by lower borrowing costs, has led to a marginal downward revision of budgeted expenditure on interest payments in FY24.

1.33  However,  even  though  expenditure  on  interest  payments  is  lower  than  budgeted,  it constitutes 30.4 per cent of the revenue expenditure in FY24 (PA). A commitment to fiscal consolidation  in  the  medium  term,  combined  with  revenues  from  asset  monetisation  and privatisation, will be essential in reducing the share of interest payments in revenue expenditure in order to generate more fiscal headroom.

1.34  Expenditure on major subsidies declined by 22.1 per cent on a YoY basis, led by a decrease in fertiliser 30  and food subsidies by 24.6 per cent and 22.4 per cent, respectively, in FY24. The prices of fertilisers had steeply increased in FY23 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, prompting a higher outlay for its subsidy. However, in FY24, the supply chains adapted, and as a result, the prices of fertilisers have broadly returned to pre-conflict levels. This facilitated a lower outlay on fertiliser subsidies. The additional food subsidy, instituted to protect vulnerable sections of the population, has been gradually consolidating as well.

## Overview of State Government Finances

1.35  State governments continued to improve their finances in FY24. Preliminary unaudited estimates of finances for a set of 23 states 31 , published by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, suggest that the gross fiscal deficit of these 23 states was 8.6 per cent lower than the budgeted figure of ₹9.1 lakh crore. 32 This implies that fiscal deficit as a per cent of GDP for these states came in at 2.8 per cent as against a budgeted 3.1 per cent. The quality of spending by state governments improved, too, with state governments focusing on capex as well.

30  Fertiliser subsidy includes nutrient-based fertiliser subsidy and urea subsidy

31    The 23 major states are: Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and West Bengal.

1.36  Charts I.46 through I.49 encapsulate states' finances 33 . The Union Government's transfers to the states are highly progressive, with states with lower Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) per  capita  receiving  higher  transfers  relative  to  their  GSDP.  On  the  revenue  side,  however, the  richer  states,  with  certain  exceptions,  are  able  to  mobilise  a  greater  proportion  of  their GSDP as taxes. The combined result of these dynamics on the receipts side is that poorer states are enabled to incur greater public spending relative to their GSDP with the system of fiscal

devolution that India has. Given the importance of public expenditure in stimulating growth and development, this is sine qua non for addressing regional imbalances in the country.

## General Government Debt

1.37  In the years since the pandemic, the Union Government and the State Governments in general have focussed on fiscal consolidation, which was reflected in the declining debt trajectory of the government till FY23. The general government debt to GDP ratio increased slightly in FY24 despite a declining primary deficit because monetary tightening led to a spike in interest rates, while the decline in inflationary pressures resulted in a lower-than-budgeted nominal GDP growth. However, with the increased prospects of monetary policy easing, along with an uptick in WPI inflation and the government's continued commitment to fiscal consolidation, the debt ratio is likely to resume its declining trend.

1.38  Union Government debt is characterised by low currency and interest rate risks. This is owing to the low share of external debt in the debt portfolio and almost all external borrowings being  from  official  sources.  The  gradual  elongation  of  the  maturity  profile  of  the  Union Government's  debt  is  leading  to  reduced  rollover  risks.  The  proportion  of  dated  securities

maturing in less than five years has seen a consistent decline in recent years. The weighted average maturity of the outstanding stock of dated securities of the Government has increased from 9.6 years in end-March 2011 to 12.5 years in end-March 2024. 36

1.39  The sustained improvement in fiscal metrics is beginning to have an impact on India's credit ratings. For the first time in 13 years, S&amp;P Global Ratings upgraded India's sovereign credit rating outlook from 'stable' to 'positive' in May 2024 on the back of robust economic growth, sound economic fundamentals and improved composition of government spending. S&amp;P mentioned that cautious monetary and fiscal policy that diminishes general government debt and interest burden while improving economic resilience could lead to a higher rating over the next two years. The agency further indicated that such an update would require continued commitment to fiscal consolidation in a manner that reduces general government deficits to below 7 per cent on a structural basis. If that were to happen, India's 10-year benchmark bond yield will drop between 30 and 50 basis points. The drop in the benchmark borrowing cost will cause interest rates to decline in general, leading to overall lower cost of borrowing for households and businesses. That would be a fiscal stimulus in itself.

## Moderation in inflation pressure

1.40  Despite  global  supply  chain  disruptions  and  adverse  weather  conditions,  domestic inflationary pressures moderated in FY24. After averaging 6.7 per cent in FY23, retail inflation declined to 5.4 per cent in FY24. This has been due to the combination of measures undertaken by the Government and the RBI. The Union Government undertook prompt measures such as open market sales, retailing in specified outlets, timely imports, reduced the prices of Liquified Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders and implemented a cut in petrol and diesel prices. The RBI raised policy rates by a cumulative 250 bps between May 2022 and February 2023. It also managed liquidity levels efficiently and maintained consistent and coherent communication with market participants. Even as higher policy rates are transmitted through the system, the RBI continues to support growth with adequate liquidity, thereby ensuring that inflation is headed to the target of 4 per cent on a durable basis. The effects of these measures are reflected in the latest data on CPI inflation - headline CPI inflation of 5.1 per cent in June 2024, and core inflation declined to 3.1 per cent. Consequently, India was the only country amongst its peers to traverse a high-growth and low-inflation path in the period FY22 - FY24 (Chart I.53). This is despite the fact that there were pressures on the food inflation front, driven by adverse weather conditions.

## The financial system remains resilient

1.41  The RBI's vigil over the banking and financial system and its prompt regulatory actions ensure that the system can withstand any macroeconomic or systemic shock. Data from the RBI's Financial Stability Report of June 2024 show that the asset quality of SCBs has improved, with the Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio declining to 2.8 per cent in March 2024, a 12-year low. The system-wide capital to risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) declined marginally by  37  basis  points  (bps)  over  FY24  due  to  an  RBI-mandated  revision  of  risk  weights  but remained well above the regulatory threshold. The profitability of SCBs remained steady, with the return on equity and return on assets ratios at 13.8 per cent and 1.3 per cent, respectively, as of March 2024. Macro stress tests also reveal that SCBs would be able to comply with minimum capital requirements even under severe stress scenarios.

1.42  The RBI remains proactive in undertaking regulatory action. In a measure to regulate the exuberant growth in the unsecured lending category and preserve financial stability, the RBI tightened norms around this portfolio. Growth in unsecured loans was outpacing that in overall credit. To tackle this problem, the RBI directed that consumer credit exposure for banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) will attract a risk weight of 125 per cent compared to 100 per cent earlier. The risk weight for credit card loans by banks and NBFCs was fixed at 150 per cent and 125 per cent, respectively, up from 125 per cent and 100 per cent earlier. Prompt regulatory actions shield the banking and financial system from adverse developments and instil confidence in market participants. The soundness of the banking system will facilitate the financing of productive opportunities and lengthen the financial cycle, both of which are necessary to sustain economic growth.

## India's external sector is safely navigating through uncertainties

1.43  On the external front, moderation in merchandise exports continued during FY24, mainly

on account of weaker global demand and persistent geopolitical tensions. However, a sharper decline in India's merchandise import growth, owing to declining commodity prices, resulted in a lower trade deficit in FY24. However, India's service exports have remained robust, reaching a new high of USD 341.1 billion in FY24. Exports (merchandise and services) in FY24 grew by 0.15 per cent, while the total imports declined by 4.9 per cent despite a strong domestic market demand. 37   Net  private  transfers,  mostly  comprising  remittances  from  abroad,  grew  to  USD 106.6 billion in FY24. As a result, the CAD stood at 0.7 per cent of the GDP during the year, an improvement from the deficit of 2.0 per cent of GDP in FY23.

1.44  Supported  by  optimism  surrounding  India's  growth  story,  progressive  policy  reform, economic stability, fiscal prudence and attractive investment avenues, India witnessed robust FPI inflows in FY24 that helped fund the CAD and aided the RBI in building adequate forex reserves. Net FPI inflows stood at USD 44.1 billion during FY24 against net outflows in the preceding two years. Net FDI inflows, however, witnessed moderation largely as a part of the global phenomenon of declining FDI flows on account of increased scepticism. Net FDI inflows to India declined from USD 42.0 billion during FY23 to USD 26.5 billion in FY24. However, gross FDI inflows moderated by only 0.6 per cent in FY24. The contraction in net inflows was primarily due to a surge in repatriation/disinvestment.

1.45  Overall, India's external sector is being deftly managed with comfortable foreign exchange reserves and a stable exchange rate. Forex reserves as of the end of March 2024 were sufficient to cover 11 months of projected imports and more than 100 per cent of total external debt. The Indian Rupee has also been one of the least volatile currencies among its emerging market peers in FY24. India's external debt vulnerability indicators also continued to be benign. External debt as a ratio to GDP stood at a low level of 18.7 per cent as of end-March 2024. The ratio of foreign exchange reserves to total debt stood at 97.4 per cent as of March 2024.

## Reduction in macro vulnerability

1.46  In its pursuit of fiscal consolidation through efficient and prudent fiscal management, the Government continues to stick to the fiscal glide path. The fiscal deficit of the Government is  expected to drop to 4.5 per cent of GDP or lower by FY26. This commitment has helped keep the sovereign debt sustainable, thereby keeping sovereign bond yields and spreads in check. All these factors have combined to keep the macroeconomic environment stable and provide a platform for sustainable growth. This is reflected in the downward trajectory of the macroeconomic vulnerability index - an index constructed by combining India's fiscal deficit, CAD and inflation.

## Box I.2: Strengthening the Statistical System

A sound and dynamic statistical system is the cornerstone for an informed citizenry, datadriven  policies  and  decision-making.  Official  statistics  play  a  pivotal  role  in  addressing societal  challenges  and  promoting  inclusive  growth.  The  government  is  taking  many steps aimed at strengthening administrative and survey statistics, building capacities and improving data quality and timeliness.

## MoSPI, the cornerstone

MoSPI is  the  nodal  ministry  for  the  planned  and  integrated  development  of  the  Indian statistical  system.  MoSPI  anchors  the  core  statistics  by  publishing  GDP,  price  and volume indices and countrywide surveys of macroeconomic and sectoral importance. The Ministry has initiated various new surveys, namely, the annual survey of unincorporated sector  enterprises,  a  time-use  survey  and  started  a  pilot  for  an  annual  survey  of  service sector enterprises. MoSPI is also working towards increasing the frequency of PLFS data and extending the generation of quarterly estimates for rural areas. Modern IT tools are being adopted for improved data capturing and processing. To encourage greater use of administrative data, a National Metadata Structure is also being developed. The Unified Data Portal project has been envisaged by MoSPI with the objective of creating a centralised database and storage system. Ministries are also taking initiatives to enhance the frequency of  various  surveys  to  make  more  informed  policy  decisions.  Given  India's  2047  goals,  it is  important  for  development  policy  that  (a)  MoSPI  is  capacitated  fully  to  produce  and integrate all required statistics with the desired quality, regularity and timeliness and (b) the quality and timeliness of administrative and transactional data of the line Ministries are brought to levels that fully facilitate timely course corrections.

## Further steps to strengthen the statistical database

- a) An extensive exercise for base revision of important economic statistics is being taken up at MoSPI. The exercise to change the base year of CPI from 2012 to 2024 has been initiated. An Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics has been set up to decide on the base year for GDP. It is important that the base year of critical data series like the GDP, different price indices and volume indices like Index of Industrial Production (IIP) are updated to the most recent feasible year at the earliest. The ongoing efforts to construct the producer price index for goods and services may be expedited to have a greater grasp of episodes of cost-push inflation. State-level variants of indices like IIP will help understand the emerging geographical patterns. Survey data to help understand private sector capital formation at regular intervals will also help policy formulation.
- b) The high-frequency price monitoring data for essential food items collected by different departments may be linked in such a way that the build-up of prices at each stage from the  farm  gate  to  the  final  consumer  is  quantifiable  and  monitorable.  This  will  help improve the effectiveness of administrative action by the Government to stabilise prices of essential food items.

- c) More than 1.3 crore entities are registered under GST and file returns. The granular GST data, if made available, has great potential to analyse the health of businesses, screening of loan applications, provide support for cash flow-based lending, and understand the economies of different geographies deeply.
- d) The XV Finance Commission observes, 'The CAG, which is mandated to carry out the role of accounts compilation and finalisation for almost all the States, as well as being the auditor of both the Union and the States, is already in the process of establishing common fiscal data standards. This would eventually ensure the availability of standardised data through a public web portal for granular level fiscal statistics of the Union and the States, both for historic audited fiscal data and high-frequency fiscal data for the current year in downloadable database formats.' 39  Granular time series, in database formats, of audited accounts of the Union and the States will make fiscal analysis and policy much easier.
- e) Regular  indicators  of  the  dynamics  of  production  and  employment  in  MSMEs  are essential, considering their potential for growth and job creation.
- f) Information may be published on industry-wise gross disbursement of bank credit (as opposed to the data on outstanding credit currently available), industry-wise monthly gross financial flows through domestic and external equity and debt routes, and other financing sources.
- g) There is also a need to have a regular mechanism to aggregate the financial flows to infrastructure  and  physical  progress-  sectorally  and  geographically  differentiatedachieved in different infrastructure sectors, at least on an annual basis.
- h) The large volume of data generated by schemes such as Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana and Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, which capture details such as hospital admissions, patients'  medical  history  or  demographic  details.  These  can  be  used  for disease surveillance, preventive medication, etc.
- i) The Labour Bureau is also tasked with conducting five surveys relating to workers and employment. Ensuring rigour, timeliness and user-friendliness of data and making it available in database formats will help analysis and policy 40 .

The thrust on evidence also necessitates that the process and impact evaluation capacities in  the  Union  and  State  Governments  and  universities  are  nurtured  and  driven  towards maturity in a time-bound manner.
