The direct benefit of a 'Viksit Bharat' is the dignity of our citizens and the improvement in their quality of life.'

- Extracted from Hon'ble Prime Minister's reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address in the Lok Sabha on July 2, 2024

The Indian growth story over the last decade has been one of resilience. The structural reforms  undertaken  by  the  Government  of  India  since  2014  have  put  the  economy firmly on a growth path, and India is soon set to become the third-largest economy in the world. In the medium term, the Indian economy can grow at a rate of 7 per cent plus on a sustained basis if we can build on the structural reforms undertaken over the last decade. Against this backdrop, the chapter identifies the areas of key policy focus as well as presents a six-pronged growth strategy to achieve this goal. The strategy elucidated in the chapter is premised on the understanding that the structural reforms of the last decade, focused on the supply side of the economy, have to give way to nextgen reforms that are bottom-up in nature to yield strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.
