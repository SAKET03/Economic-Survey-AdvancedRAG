## AGRICULTURE AND FOOD MANAGEMENT: PLENTY OF UPSIDE LEFT IF WE GET IT RIGHT

In the last five years, the agriculture sector has grown at an average growth rate of 4.18 per cent per year. The country also has a comfortable stock of foodgrains, around 40 per cent 1   of which is distributed to two-thirds of the population free of cost. India exports more than 7 per cent 2  of its food grains. The growth in the agriculture and allied sectors has contributed positively to the growth of the Indian economy.

However, specific challenges remain. Low productivity levels, the impact of variability in weather, fragmented land holdings and inadequate marketing infrastructure affect agriculture performance. The chapter discusses these aspects while also focussing on government interventions  in  the  crop,  livestock,  animal  husbandry  and  fisheries  to enhance investment and productivity, provide reasonable returns to farmers through the minimum support price (MSP), improve access to high-quality inputs and enable better extension services. Looking ahead, the digitalisation initiatives in Agriculture are expected to empower farmers through better decision-making tools. The chapter also discusses welfare schemes like PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana (PMGKAY), the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and India's food management programme, including food procurement and allocation.
