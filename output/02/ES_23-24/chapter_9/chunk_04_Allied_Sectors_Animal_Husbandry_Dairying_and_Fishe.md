# Allied Sectors: Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries are significant growth drivers

## ALLIED SECTORS: ANIMAL HUSBANDRY, DAIRYING AND FISHERIES ARE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH DRIVERS

9.31  The allied sectors of Indian agriculture are steadily emerging as robust growth centres and promising sources for improving farm incomes. From 2014-15 to 2022-23, the livestock sector grew at an impressive Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.38 per cent at constant prices. The contribution of livestock to the total GVA (at constant prices) in agriculture and allied sectors increased from 24.32 per cent in 2014-15 to 30.38 per cent in 2022-23. In 202223, the livestock sector contributed 4.66 per cent of the total GVA, significantly boosting the per capita availability of milk, eggs, and meat. The fisheries sector, a crucial contributor to the Indian economy, makes up about 6.72 per cent of the agricultural GVA and has grown at compound  annual rate of 8.9 per cent between 2014-15 and 2022-23 (at constant prices). This 'sunrise sector' supports approximately 30 million people, particularly marginalised and vulnerable communities.

9.32  Recognising the increasing relevance of the allied sector in agricultural growth and as a  buoyant source of farm income, several government initiatives are being implemented to enhance  productivity,  ensure  animal  health,  and  facilitate  infrastructure  development.  The interventions  include  a  focus  on  improving  animal  health  (Livestock  Health  and  Disease Control Programme), nurturing entrepreneurship development and per-animal productivity (National  Livestock  Mission)  and  promoting  FPOs  and  Self-Help  Groups.  The  Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) facilitates investments from individual entrepreneurs,  private  companies,  FPOs,  and  Section  8  companies  and  Diary  Cooperative (included by merging Dairy Processing and Infrastructure Development Fund in AHIDF) in key areas like dairy processing, meat processing, animal feed plants, and breed improvement technology. The government provides a 3 per cent interest subvention to the borrower and a credit guarantee of up to 25 per cent of total borrowing. As of May 2024, 408 projects have been sanctioned by the lending banks/ NABARD/NDDB worth ₹13.861 Crore, generating 40,000 direct employment opportunities and benefiting more than 42 lakh farmers.

9.33  In  2022-23,  India  achieved  a  record  fish  production  of  17.54  million  tons,  ranking third  globally  and  accounting  for  8  per  cent  of  global  production.  To  bolster  this  sector,  a comprehensive  intervention  has  been  developed  in  the  form  of  Pradhan  Mantri  Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) with the objective to enhance seed and fish production and other extension services. To address the sector's infrastructure needs, the Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) was introduced in 2018-19 with a total fund size of ₹7.52  Thousand  Crore.  So  far,  121  proposals  have  been  recommended  for  ₹5.59  Thousand Crore as a concessional rate 41 .

## Cooperative Societies- Empowering farmers by strengthening communities

9.34  Cooperatives are vital in aggregating produce, enhancing bargaining power, and ensuring better  market  access  to  small  and  marginal  farmers,  thereby  preventing  exploitation  by middlemen and traders. This was seen in the case of the dairy cooperative's movement, which focused on small rural producers (those with 1-2 hectares of land holding) 42 .  There is a realisation that  Primary  Agriculture  Credit  Societies  (PACS)  can  be  useful  vehicles  for  facilitating  the convergence of various schemes intended for farmers' welfare, improving their effectiveness and  reach  through  better  participation  of  the  small  and  marginal  farmers  in  development programmes. The government approved a scheme in 2023 with the target of setting up PACS in the next five years in the Panchayats/Villages yet to be covered.

9.35  There has also been an increase in the number of single-state and multi-state cooperatives 43 (MSCs). As of March 2024, there are 8.03 lakh single-state and 1614 multistate cooperatives. Further,  under  the  Multistate  Cooperative  Societies  Act  2002,  three  new  MSCs  -  National Cooperative  Exports  Limited  (NCEL),  Bhartiya  Beej  Sahakari  Samiti  Limited  (BBSSL)  and

43 Cooperative societies with objects confined to one State only are governed by the Cooperative laws of the respective State Government and the cooperative societies with objects confined to more than one State are governed by the central law, namely, the Multi-State Co-operative Societies.

National Cooperative Organics Limited (NCOL)-have been established at the national level. The new cooperatives seek to promote exports, facilitate access to improved seeds under a single brand name, and work toward the production, distribution, and marketing of certified and authentic organic products. The response to the setting of the three national-level cooperatives has been promising both in terms of the acceptance evident from applications received for membership and the permissions already received for the export of cereals to several countries. As of 31 March 2024, NCEL has received 7,318 applications for membership from 19 States &amp; 03 UTs. It has so far got permission for exports of 15.02 LMT non-basmati white rice to 16 countries, 9.99 LMT broken rice to 07 countries, 50,000 MT sugar to two countries, and 14,184 MT wheat grain, 5326 MT wheat flour &amp; 15.22 lakh MT maida/semolina to one country. As of 31 March 2024, BBSSL has received 16,775 applications for membership from 32 States/UTs. As of 31 March 2024, 5,154 applications for membership have been received from 26 States/UTs. NCOL has launched 11 products- arhar, chana, moong, kabuli chana, masoor, rajma, jaggery powder, sugar, besan, daliya, and jowar atta, under the Bharat Organics Brand.

## Box IX.6: Initiatives to address scope and functioning of PACS

Several initiatives taken to improve the functioning and scope of work of the PACS include the following:

- With  the  view  to  improving  efficiency,  the  PACS/Large  Area  Multipurpose  Societies (LAMP) are being linked with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD)  through  a  single  National  Software  Network.  So  far,  proposals  for  the computerisation of 67009 PACS have been sanctioned across 30 states/UTs, and ₹654 Crore to the States and ₹141 Crore to NABARD have been released.
- A  grain  storage  programme,  which  will  be  the  world's  largest  decentralised  storage program, is planned in the cooperative sector to ensure food security and reduce wastage. Under this scheme, agricultural infrastructure, such as godowns, custom hiring centres, processing units, fair price shops, etc., are being created through the convergence of various existing schemes of the Government of India at the PACS level. The pilot project in  11  PACS  of  11  States  has  been  initiated  while  the  construction  of  godowns  in  500 additional PACS is approved.
- The scope of work of the PACS has been increased to allow them to function as common service centres for better access to e-services, provide LPG distributorship to increase employment opportunities and improve the financial strength of the PACS, to convert bulk consumer petrol pumps operated by PACS into retail outlets and to give priority for new petrol/diesel pump dealership.
- PACS  will  function  as  Janaushadhdi  Kendra  and  Pradhan  Mantri  Kisan  Samridihi Kendra,  including  as  drone  entrepreneurs.  Further,  PACS  will  be  eligible  as  'paani samiti' to undertake operations and maintenance work for the piped water supply and will be responsible for setting up decentralised solar power plants at the panchayat level.

9.36  In addition to the above, steps have also been taken to strengthen the governance of the cooperatives. The Multistate Cooperative Societies (Amendment) Act, 2023, which came into effect on 03 August 2023, seeks to enhance transparency and accountability and improve the election process in the multistate cooperative societies by supplementing existing legislation and incorporating the provisions of the 97th constitutional amendment that addresses several aspects  such  as  the  appointment  of  an  ombudsman,  introduction  of  concurrent  audit,  and stipulation of criteria of appointment of chief executive officer.

## Agriculture Research and Education: Pushing the frontiers of technology

9.37  Investment  in  agriculture  research  and  support  of  enabling  policies  have  contributed substantially  to  food  security.  It  is  estimated  that  for  every  rupee  invested  in  agricultural research (including education), there is a payoff of ₹13.85. In 2022-23, ₹19.65 Thousand Crore was spent on agriculture research, equalling 0.43 per cent of the agricultural GVA. 44  There is a need to further strengthen research given the number of abiotic and biotic pressures the agriculture sector faces.

9.38  The Indian Council on Agricultural Research (ICAR), is the apex organisation in agriculture research in  the  country.  It  has  worked  in  diverse  areas  of  research  covering  crop  and  seed production, bio-fortified varieties of grains and oils, promotion of millets, animal production and health, agricultural mechanisation and post-harvest management, and fisheries. Farmers' outreach  for  agricultural  technologies  demonstration  and  skill  upgradation  are  important aspects of the work carried out by ICAR. During 2022-23, 347 varieties/hybrids of 44 crops were released, and 99 varieties of horticultural crops were notified for commercial cultivation. In addition, 27 bio-fortified varieties of rice, wheat, maize, finger millet, mustard, soybean and

groundnut were released. Many of the rice varieties that India now exports to the rest of the world came out of research at the International Rice Research Institute. It is a reminder that agricultural research offers one of the highest returns on investment. Hence, reinforcing the agricultural research ecosystem with human and financial resources will continue to pay rich dividends to farmers and to the nation.
