## INTRODUCTION

9.1 The Indian agriculture sector provides livelihood support to about 42.3 per cent of the population and has a share of 18.2 per cent in the country's GDP 3  at current prices. The sector has  been  buoyant,  which  is  evident  from  the  fact  that  it  has  registered  an  average  annual growth rate of 4.18 4 per cent at constant prices over the last five years. Several initiatives and measures taken by the government in the form of assured remunerative prices through MSP improving access to institutional credit, enabling crop diversification, promoting digitisation, and mechanisation, encouraging adoption of sustainable practices through organic and natural farming, and focusing on productivity enhancement have had a positive impact on the sector. As per provisional estimates for 2023-24, the growth rate of the agriculture sector stood at 1.4

per cent, 5  which is below 4.7 per cent in 2022-23 6 , mainly because of a drop in the foodgrain production due to delayed and poor monsoons caused by El Nino. The allied activities - livestock and fisheries have performed better than the traditional crops such as cereals 7 , which is evident from an increase in their share in agriculture Gross Value Added (GVA) at current prices from 24.38 per cent and 4.44 per cent in 2014-15 to 30.23 per cent and 7.25 per cent in 2022-23 8 respectively. The share of the crops sector in Agriculture GVA at current prices in 2022-23 9  was 55.28 per cent as compared to 61.75 per cent in 2014-15.

9.2 While the country is a major agriculture producer, being the second largest producer in rice, wheat, cotton, among other crops, and the largest producer of milk, pulses and spices 10 , the crop yields in the country are much lower than the other major producers (Fig IX.2). That this is so despite the fact that the bulk of the government support goes to rice and wheat if a cause for reflection. Fragmented land holdings, low farm investment, lack of farm mechanisation, insufficient access to quality inputs, and inadequate marketing infrastructure leading to postharvest losses, dependency on rains and short growing seasons are a few reasons for the low yields.

9.3 Several  interventions  are  being  undertaken  to  improve  productivity  in  agriculture  in line with the recommendations of the Doubling Farmers Income Report (DFI) 2016, which identified strategies to increase crop and livestock productivity, enchancing cropping intensity, diversify to high-value agriculture and provide remunerative prices on farmers' produce. The decision in 2018-19 to fix MSP at one and half times the all-India weighted average cost of

production  was  a  step  towards  providing  assured  remunerative  prices  to  farmers.  Other interventions  include  income  support  through  Pradhan  Mantri  Kisan  Samman  Nidhi  (PMKISAN), which gives the farmer a direct financial benefit of ₹6000/- per year. Promotion of greater efficiency in the use of inputs and sustainable production methods through Per Drop More Crop (PDMC), a micro irrigation scheme and the actions under the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), including the use of alternative and organic fertilisers are a few examples on other initiatives being undertaken to improve productivity and sustainability. In addition, digital initiatives such as the Digital Agriculture Mission and e-National Agriculture Market  (e-NAM)  have  also  been  taken  up  to  facilitate  the  adoption  of  smart  agriculture technologies, with the latter allowing better price discovery.

9.4 The roles, animal husbandry and fisheries play in improving farmers' income, especially when agriculture holdings are reduced, is duly recognised.  The scheme such as the Rashtriya Gokul Mission(RGM), National Digital Livestock Mission 4  (NDLM), and National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD) include interventions to improve quality, enable access to the organised markets and the development of indigenous breeds. The fisheries sector has been supported through programmes for improving productivity, access to institutional credit, and infrastructure development through the Fisheries Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) with a total fund size of ₹7.52 Thousand Crore. Similarly, Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana  (PMMSY)  introduced  in  May  2020  aimed  at  strengthening  fisheries  infrastructure, enable technology infusion and promote optimal water management. These interventions in fisheries sector have resulted in increasing fish production by an average annual growth of 7.4 per cent in 2022-23 from 2020-21 11 .
