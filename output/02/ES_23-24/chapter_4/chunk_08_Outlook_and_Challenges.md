# Outlook and Challenges

## OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES

4.84  Though ongoing geopolitical headwinds impacted India's merchandise exports, lowering international commodity prices ensured a lower trade deficit in FY24 than in FY23. A  narrowing  merchandise  trade  deficit  and  rising  service  exports  have  improved  the  CAD, ending with a surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP in Q4 of FY24. In the coming years, India's trade deficit is expected to decline further as the PLI scheme is expanded and India creates a globally competitive manufacturing base in several product categories. Further, the recently signed FTAs are expected to increase the global market share of the country's exports. Various international agencies and RBI expect the CAD to GDP to moderate to below one per cent for FY24, driven by growing merchandise and services exports and resilient remittances.

4.85 However, the risks to the performance of India's external sector are on the downside due  to  the  persistence  of  current  geopolitical  tensions  and  policy  uncertainty.  Some  of  the challenges are mentioned below: -

-  Fall in demand from major trading partners: As per the DGCIS data, the US was India's  second-largest  trading  partner  in  FY24  after  China.  However,  the  USA's  overall import volume declined by 1.7 per cent in 2023 compared to a growth of 8.6 per cent in 2022, as  per  OECD. This significantly influenced export growth in trading partners, including

India. 115  Rising protectionism is another risk that could undermine trade recovery in 2024 and 2025.

-  Rise  in  trade  cost: Attacks  on  shipping  in  the  Red  Sea  and  drought  in  the  Panama Canal  have  resulted  in  trade  flows  being  re-routed,  increasing  journey  time  and  costs as  mentioned  in  para  4.8  above.  India's  merchandise  trade  relies  heavily  on  maritime trade, so disturbances in major shipping routes can impact its economy. A CRISIL report 116 highlighted that the Red Sea crisis has impacted the Middle East's fertiliser exports to India as imports of the Muriate of Potash from Jordan and Israel have been affected.
-  Commodity price volatility: Fluctuations in commodity prices, especially for critical imports like oil, metals, and agricultural products, can impact India's trade balance and inflation  levels.  Disappointing  global  growth  presents  a  downside  risk,  especially  for industrial commodities. Additional trade restrictions could push food prices higher.
-  Trade policy changes: Changes in trade policies by major trading partners or geopolitical developments can affect India's export opportunities and market access. As per the WTO's Trade Monitoring Report, November 2023 117 , the pace of WTO members' implementation of new export restrictions has increased significantly since 2020. 75 export restrictions on food, feed and fertilisers are still in place globally, in addition to 20 COVID-19-related export restrictions. For 2023, the trade covered by import restrictions in force was estimated at USD 2,480 billion, representing almost one-tenth of total world imports.

4.86 It is critical to explore what these changing paradigms mean for India. Policies need to be a mix that straddles security concerns with economic considerations. India's push towards manufacturing in complex and niche sectors through schemes such as PLI and Make in India aims  to  balance  these  goals.  On  the  other  hand,  India's  edge  in  services  will  catalyse  our globalisation over the coming years. A recent paper by the Peterson Institute for International Economics 118 , asserts that globalisation in services is ongoing, even as we are past the era of hyperglobalised trade in goods. This implies that the global demand for India's services sector exports is here to stay.

4.87 India  is  simultaneously  working  towards  unlocking  the  potential  gains  from  growing integration  by  augmenting  the  logistics  front.  This  is  evident  from  the  large  infrastructure deals which have been signed to ramp up trade. For instance, the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is expected to shorten trade time for shipments to Russia and Europe.  Another  major  joint  infrastructure  deal,  the  India-Middle  East  Europe  corridor (IMEC), will connect Asia with Europe via ports and railroads. Similarly, there is a concerted effort towards striking trade agreements with countries spanning geographies.

4.88 Ultimately, India needs to focus on improving its competitiveness in many product areas. For example, India has tremendous potential in becoming a large global exporter in agricultural commodities. Fostering stronger regional trade ties and adding more markets for Indian goods will help mitigate global demand fluctuations. In an era when global economic growth is likely to be buffeted by geopolitical tensions and protectionism, growing India's exports of goods and services will be a stiffer challenge than before. Product safety and quality consciousness in the private sector and policy stability in the public sector are obvious starting points to turn the challenge into an opportunity.
