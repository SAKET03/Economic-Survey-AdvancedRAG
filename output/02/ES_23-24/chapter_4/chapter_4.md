## EXTERNAL SECTOR: STABILITY AMID PLENTY

<!-- image -->

India's  external  sector  remained  strong  amidst  ongoing  geopolitical  headwinds accompanied  by  sticky  inflation.  Though  merchandise  exports  moderated  owing  to lower  demand from major trading partners, services  exports  continued  to  perform well, cushioning the overall trade deficit from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24. Lower prices of imported commodities, including crude oil, also helped.

The moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports have improved India's current account deficit (CAD). Amongst services exports, software/IT services have driven an increase in overall exports; at the same time, business services exports have also been rising,  supported  by  India  emerging  as  a  hub  for  Global  Capability Centres (GCCs).

India  is  moving  up  the  global  value  chains  (GVCs),  with  the  share  of  GVC-related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3 per cent in 2022 from 35.1 per cent in 2019. The improvement in GVC participation is also reflected in increased pure backward GVC participation. Aided by government measures on trade facilitation and reduction in logistics cost, India's rank in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023 out of 139 countries.

India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows in FY24 of USD 44.1  billion,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth,  a  stable  business  environment, and  increased  investor  confidence.  Rising  FPI  inflows  kept  the  Indian  Rupee  in  a manageable  range  of  ₹82  to  ₹83.5/USD  in  FY24.  The  Rupee  emerged  as  the  least volatile  currency  among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies in  FY24. The shock absorbers of India's external sector - forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, and market-determined exchange rate, are in place to cushion the global headwinds.

In  the  future,  the  changing  composition  of  India's  export  basket,  enhancement  in trade-related  infrastructure,  enhanced  quality  consciousness  and  product  safety considerations in the private sector and stable policy environment are expected to play a significant role in driving India's rise as a global supplier of goods and services.

## INTRODUCTION

- 4.1 Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy has been buffeted by several shocks - the Russia-Ukraine conflict, developments in the Middle East and the Red Sea crisis, leading to  supply  dislocations  in  several  commodities  and  a  considerable  rise  in  inflation  in  many countries. Moreover, citizens of about 64 countries (plus the European Union), about 49 per cent  of  the  world  population,  will  exercise  their  franchise  in  2024.  This  adds  to  the  policy uncertainty confronting the global economy, especially in the context of international trade and immigration policies. Foreign investments, which drive international trade and commerce, have slowed down recently due to these uncertainties, higher interest rates in the developed world, and the pursuit of active industrial policies by developed countries. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act of the United States of America not only incentivised investment capital to stay at home but also lured capital from elsewhere. 1
- 4.2 As per the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 2 , global foreign direct investment (FDI) decreased marginally by 2 per cent to USD 1.3 trillion in 2023 from USD 1.4 trillion in 2022. Global trade, too, has been on a slow path, with the value of world merchandise trade declining by 5 per cent in 2023. External debt as a percentage of GDP of Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDEs) increased from 26.2 per cent in 2012 to 29.8 per cent in 2023. After witnessing a deficit in their current account balance in 2022, Advanced Economies (AEs) saw a surplus in 2023. For EMDEs, the current account balance has been in surplus in 2022 and 2023, albeit a moderation from 1.5 per cent of the GDP in 2022 to 0.6 per cent of GDP in 2023. 3
- 4.3 Against this backdrop, the chapter deals with India's performance on external sectorrelated  parameters.  Section  1  discusses  prevailing  global  trade  dynamics  and  the  impact  of ongoing  geopolitical  headwinds  on  trade.  Section  2  focuses  on  India's  international  trade sector, presenting some specific case studies on industries that have shown remarkable export performances while also dwelling on the general trends. It also presents the outcomes of some of India's latest Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). The section further presents some analytical understanding of the exposure of our exports to imports from various countries and the need for  preparedness in the wake of any external unforeseen supply shocks. Section 3 presents in some detail the trends in capital flows into the country and draws some insights from the trends. Section 4 presents the country's balance of payments (BoP) situation, comparing it with some peer countries. It also presents the position of our foreign exchange reserves (FER) and international investment position (IIP), which buffer the economy from an uncertain external environment  turning  adverse.  Section  5  dwells  on  India's  external  debt  trends  and  how  it has been deftly managed. Section 6 concludes with the outlook for the external sector while mentioning the key challenges to tackle.

## CHANGING GLOBAL TRADE DYNAMICS

- 4.4 Trade is a key pillar of an economy, spurring investment, job creation, economic growth, and raising living standards. Global trade patterns are reconfiguring. In 2023, Mexico became the largest goods trade partner of the US, surpassing China and Canada, with a total trade of USD 798 billion. 4  Vietnam's trade with China and the US has recently seen an increase. US imports from Vietnam more than doubled from USD 46 billion in 2017 to USD 114 billion in 2023. During the same time, Vietnam's imports from China rose from USD 58 billion to USD 111 billion. 5  In another instance, European economies are shifting their energy imports from Russia to Norway and the US. EU's pipeline gas imports from Russia declined from 150.2 billion cubic meters in 2021 to 42.9 billion cubic meters in 2023. During the same time, its pipeline gas  imports  from  the  US  rose  from  18.9  billion  cubic  meters  to  56.2  billion  cubic  meters. 6 These shifts reflect the emergence of new practices in international trade such as 'decoupling', 'derisking',  'reshoring',  'nearshoring',  and  'friend  sharing'  and  the  growing  narrative  of  deglobalisation. 7
- 4.5 However, there is an argument that while the growth of trade as a percentage of GDP has  stalled  since  the  global  financial  crisis,  the  slowdown  of  global  trade  seems  a  natural development following its earlier fast growth (Chart IV.2). 8  The de-globalisation trends are highly heterogeneous across countries. While the US and China are gradually decreasing their reliance  on  global  markets,  this  does  not  seem  true  for  the  rest  of  the  world. 9 Research  by the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) shows that despite its policies, the US remains reliant on Chinese inputs. In fact, the rise in trade through Mexico and Vietnam is a result of Chinese firms re-routing their supply through these countries (or by locating themselves in these countries). Further, China's overwhelming dominance in the supply of processed critical minerals and materials for energy transition renders a true decoupling between the two nations neither easy nor likely.
- 4.6 As can be seen in Chart IV.1, global trade volume contracted by 1.2 per cent in 2023 after recording a 3 per cent expansion in 2022 following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 10 The value of world merchandise trade fell by 5 per cent in 2023, indicating the effect of lower prices. This decline was offset mainly by a substantial increase in trade in commercial services, which rose by 9 per cent to USD 7.5 billion in 2023. Commercial services trade was lifted by

7   As per the World Economic Forum, friend-shoring refers to rerouting supply chains to countries perceived as politically and economically safe or low-risk to avoid disruption to the flow of business. Nearshoring refers to a company relocating business operations to a nearby country, often with a shared border. Reshoring is when a business transfers operations back to its home country.

recovering international travel and increasing digitally delivered services. Global exports of digitally delivered services rose by 9 per cent to USD 4.3 trillion in 2023, accounting for 13.8 per cent of the world exports of goods and services.

4.7 The adverse trade environment in 2023 is expected to ease somewhat this year and next, boosting goods trade in 2024 and 2025. 11  World merchandise trade volume is expected to grow at 2.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, as demand for traded goods rebounds. The evidence of a rebound in global trade in 2025 is visible in the latest report released by UNCTAD. 12   As per the report, global trade trends turned positive in the first quarter of 2024, with the value of trade in goods increasing by around 1 per cent quarter-over-quarter and services by about 1.5 per cent. The growth was primarily driven by increased exports from China (9 per cent), India (7 per cent) and the USA (3 per cent). However, geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty could limit the scope of any trade rebound. While export growth is expected to improve in many economies as external demand for goods picks up, food and energy prices could again spike due to geopolitical events and climate disturbances. Further, restrictive trade practices increasingly adopted by many countries are leading to higher prices because supply chains have become increasingly complex. 13

4.8 The resilience of global trade is being tested by disruptions on two of the world's leading shipping routes, viz the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal. The Panama Canal handles 6 per cent of global trade and over 70 per cent of traffic destined for or originating from the US. It is presently operating at partial capacity due to freshwater shortages, with restrictions likely to  remain in place for some time. Meanwhile, the Suez Canal handles about 12 per cent of global trade and about one-third of container shipping between Asia and Europe. 14  The traffic

diversion from the Red Sea and around the Cape of Good Hope has added ten days to AsiaEurope  journeys  while  also  increasing  fuel  costs.  Although  global  shipping  costs  returned to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of last year, container shipping rates have risen again. Extended detours around the Cape of Good Hope have led to a significant surge in ocean freight rates, reaching up to USD 10,000 per 40-foot container. Moreover, the Suez Canal Authority has declared a 5-15 per cent hike in transit fees for ships passing through the Panama Canal. 15

- 4.9 Amidst these prevailing geopolitical dynamics, India is expected to benefit from its strong trade relations across countries, as the analysis in the subsequent sections shows. India has broad and diversified trade relationships with Asia, Europe, and the US. The following section discusses India's trade performance.

## INDIA'S TRADE: RESILIENCE AMIDST GLOBAL TURMOIL

4.10 International  trade  has  contributed  to  India's  economic  growth.  Over  time,  through concerted  reforms  and  facilitative  measures  to  enhance  trade,  there  has  been  a  significant increase in the share of trade (goods and services) in GDP. The trade openness indicator 16 , which rose from 37.5 in FY05 to 45.9 in FY24, has contributed significantly to economic growth as it facilitated an efficient allocation of resources through comparative advantage. The share of trade (excluding petroleum products exports and crude oil imports) in GDP rose from 32.3 per cent in FY05 to 40.8 in FY23. India's trade has been catching up with global levels, as reflected in Chart IV.2 below.

4.11 Chart IV.3 indicates that India is gaining market share in global exports of goods and services. Its share in global goods exports was 1.8 per cent in FY24, against an average of 1.7 per cent during FY16-FY20. Similarly, its share in global services exports rose to 4.3 per cent in FY23 from an average of 3.3 per cent during FY16-FY20.

## India's Overall trade

4.12 India's overall exports (merchandise and services) have been growing on a secular basis since FY17 for almost three years. However, FY20 saw an economic slowdown, aggravated by the

outbreak of the global pandemic, which halted this trend. FY22 marked a significant turnaround. A similar trend has been observed in overall imports (merchandise and services). The positive momentum extended into FY23, with India's overall exports crossing USD 776 billion. Overall imports also  increased  to  USD  898  billion  in  FY23  compared  to  USD  760.1  billion  in  FY22. Despite persistent global challenges, overall exports in FY24 surpassed the FY23 record, growing by 0.23 per cent, and overall imports in FY24 declined by 4.9 per cent despite robust domestic demand. During the first two months of FY25, overall exports increased to USD 133.6 billion, compared to USD 122.4 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. During the same time period, overall imports also increased from USD 136.4 billion to USD 149.9 billion, leading to a widening of the overall trade deficit from USD 14 billion to USD 16.3 billion.

## Merchandise Trade: Enduring the global headwinds

## Merchandise exports

4.13 Affected  by  ongoing  geopolitical  tensions,  India's  merchandise  exports  witnessed contraction in H2 of FY23 and H1 of FY24. However, there is evidence of a trend reversal in H2 of FY24, with merchandise exports registering positive growth. Box IV.1 discusses the sectors that have shown remarkable export performance in the past few years. With rising exports, imports also witnessed positive growth in H2 of FY24. However, despite registering positive growth in H2 FY24, merchandise exports and imports contracted in FY24 compared to FY23. The decline in merchandise exports was mainly on account of a slowdown in India's major exporting partners (especially the EU, whose real GDP grew barely by 0.6 per cent in 2023, compared to 3.6 per cent growth in 2024), along with the lagged impact of monetary tightening carried  out  by  many  countries  to  control  rising  inflation.  While  the  volume  of  imports  did not decline in FY24, the overall value of merchandise imports declined due to a fall in global commodity prices. Owing to a larger decline in imports than exports, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed to USD 238.3 billion in FY24 compared to USD 264.9 billion in the previous

year.  The  non-petroleum  and  non-gems  and  jewellery  merchandise  exports  have  shown resilience with a sustained uptick in the last few months, resulting in exports worth USD 320.2 billion in FY24, 1.5 per cent higher than the previous year. At the same time, non-petroleum, non-gems &amp; jewellery imports (gold, silver &amp; precious metals) saw a contraction of (-)3.5 per cent in FY24.

<!-- image -->

4.14 A decline in inflationary pressures in advanced economies has led to an increase in global demand for exports in the first two months of FY25. Accordingly, India's merchandise exports rose to USD 73.1 billion during April-May 2024 from USD 69.6 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year.

<!-- image -->

4.15 From FY23 to FY24, there appears to be a shift in the composition of exports across various classifications. Notably, the share of capital goods in merchandise exports rose substantially from 16.3 per cent in FY23 to 18.9 per cent in FY24. This increase suggests India's improved supplies  of  machinery,  equipment,  and  other  durable  goods  used  in  production  processes, reflecting potential expansions or upgrades in its industrial capacities. Conversely, the share of  consumer goods in merchandise exports declined slightly from 48.9 per cent in FY23 to 47.5 per cent in FY24, indicating a marginal dip in the export of finished products intended for direct consumption. The share of intermediate goods also declined from 30.2 per cent to 28.4 per cent.

## Box IV.1: Product specific success stories of boosting exports

A series of measures undertaken by the Government have shown a remarkable increase in product-specific exports. Some of the success stories are mentioned below: -

Toy Exports: India's toy industry has long faced challenges in the global trade landscape, consistently being a net importer of toys for many years. However, the industry's exports experienced  notable  growth  in  2023.  As  per  the  Directorate  General  of  Commerce Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&amp;S) data, India's toy exports have shown a rising trend, registering a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 15.9 per cent between FY13 and FY24. 18   Rising exports, coupled with declining imports, transformed India from a deficit to a surplus nation in the trade of toys. For over a decade, India heavily relied on China for around 76 per cent of its toy imports. India's import bill for toys from China dropped from USD 214 million in FY13 to USD 41.6 million in FY24, leading to a decline in China's share in India's toy imports from 94 per cent in FY13 to 64 per cent in FY24, 19  indicating India's competitiveness in the international toy market.

## Chart IV.7: Trend in India's exports and imports of toys

Source: Export Import Data Bank (Annual), Trade Statistics, Ministry of Commerce and Industry

- 18 Trade data is reported for HS Codes 9503, 9504 and 9505
- 19 Trade data is reported for HS Code 9503, as it accounts for more than 80 per cent of toys imports from China

Over the period 2014 to 2020, focused efforts by the Government resulted in the number of manufacturing units doubling, dependence on imported inputs reducing from 33 per cent to 12 per cent, the gross sales value growing by a CAGR of 10 per cent, and an overall rise in labour productivity. 20

The measures taken by the Government for the toy industry include the formulation of a comprehensive National Action Plan for Toys with 21 specific action points, an increase in basic customs duty on toys, sample testing of each import consignment by the Directorate General  of  Foreign  Trade  (DGFT)  to  curb  sub-standard  imports,  issuance  of  a  Quality Control Order for toys, and support through cluster-based approaches. India's emergence as a toy exporting nation can be further attributed to its integration into the global toy value chain and zero-duty market access for domestically manufactured toys in critical countries such as the UAE and Australia. 21

Defence  Exports: India's  defence  production  grew  substantially  from  ₹74,054  crore in FY17 to ₹108,684 crore in FY23, boosting defence exports. 22   Between 2015 and 2019, India held the distinction of being the world's second-largest arms importer. The narrative, however, has changed. India has transitioned from an arms importer and found a place in the list of the top 25 arms exporter nations. The defence industry, including the private sector and Defence Public Sector Undertakings (DPSUs), has made tremendous efforts to achieve the highest-ever defence exports. In addition, there has been a rise in the number of export authorisations issued to the defence exporters. From 1,414 export authorisations in FY23, the number has increased to 1,507 in FY24. About 100 domestic companies are exporting a wide range of defence products and equipment such as aircraft like Dornier-228, artillery guns, Brahmos Missiles, PINAKA rockets and launchers, radars, simulators, and armoured vehicles.

To give a push to defence exports, the Government has taken several policy initiatives over the  past  ten  years.  Export  procedures  have  been  simplified  and  made  industry-friendly, with  end-to-end  online  export  authorisation  curtailing  delays  and  facilitating  ease  of doing business. Further, the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiatives have helped the country by encouraging  indigenous  design,  development  and  manufacture  of  defence  equipment, thereby reducing dependency on imports in the long run.

Footwear Exports: The Indian footwear and leather industry is  an  important  foreign exchange  earner.  India  is  the  second-largest  global  producer  of  footwear  after  China, accounting for 13 per cent of global footwear production and 2.2 per cent of global exports. India is the ninth-largest global footwear exporter. 23  As per DGCIS, India's footwear exports have increased from USD 1.9 billion in FY21 to USD 2.5 billion in FY24. 24

## Chart IV.9: Trend in footwear exports

The  Government  has  undertaken  various  measures  to  boost  footwear  exports.  These include the issuance of three Quality Control Orders for the footwear and leather sector after consultation with the Bureau of Indian Standards, relaxation in the creation of testing facilities  by  allowing  outsourcing  of  the  majority  of  the  tests  which  are  carried  out  less frequently, creating awareness amongst footwear manufacturers of footwear across India, among others. The Government has approved the continuation of the 'Indian Footwear and Leather Development Programme' till 31 March 2026. The leather and footwear sector can avail benefits of export promotion schemes under the Foreign Trade Policy 2023 and other benefits  provided  under  the  Market  Access  Initiatives  Scheme,  Trade  Infrastructure  for Export Schem, Interest Equalisation Scheme, etc. 25   The Indian footwear market, valued at USD 26 billion, is expected to reach USD 90 billion by 2030. This growth will be driven by increased non-leather footwear demand and a possible shift in leather shoe production

from  small-scale  cottage  industries  to  large  corporates. 26   Changing  market  dynamics, mainly fuelled by evolving shopping habits, rapid urbanisation, greater brand awareness, the development of retail precincts/malls, and rising discretionary budgets, are contributing to this trend.

Smartphone exports: India's  domestic  production  and  exports  of  smartphones  have been increasing steadily, with significant changes achieved, especially since the launch of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020. FY20 marked the first-time domestic production exceeded domestic demand, and smartphones became one of India's top export categories. Exports now provide the primary stimulus for the growth of the sector. A 42.2 per cent increase in exports in FY24 (on a YoY basis) enabled smartphones to rank among India's top five export items considered at six-digit HS product categories. 27

India also became the world's sixth-largest smartphone exporter in 2022, from the 23rdlargest smartphone exporter in 2014. 28  This high export growth has led to an increase in the ratio of exports to production, with exports being above 31 per cent of the total output of smartphones in India in FY24.

4.16 India is adding more export destinations, signalling regional diversification of exports. Calculations  based  on  DGCIS  data  reveal  that  the  share  of  the  top  10  countries  in  India's merchandise exports has registered a declining trend, falling from a high of 61.9 per cent in FY2000 to 50.5 per cent in FY24. Further, the Regional Herfindahl Index (an estimate of the concentration of exports across countries) 29  for the top 10 countries declined from 0.071 in FY2000 to 0.046 in FY24.

4.17 Post-FY2000, Asian, African and Middle Eastern nations, such as the UAE, Singapore, Hong  Kong,  and  China,  have  emerged  as  export  destinations,  replacing  traditional  export partners like the UK, Germany, Belgium, etc. The combined share of the developing regions viz. Asia and Africa in India's total exports rose from around 42.9 per cent in FY2000 to 52 per cent in FY24. In FY24, UAE, Singapore, China, Russia, and Australia emerged as India's major export partners.

## Sectoral trends

4.18 A  bifurcation  of  merchandise  exports  into  POL  and  non-POL  products  shows  that exports across both categories have declined in FY24. The fall in POL exports can be attributed mainly to a decline in global petroleum product prices. Even though the volume of POL exports increased from 99 million tonnes in FY23 to 108 million tonnes in FY24, the value of exports declined by 13.7 per cent, from USD 97.5 billion to USD 84.2 billion during the same period. However, in the last six years, POL exports increased by 80.8 per cent from USD 46.6 billion in FY19 to USD 84.2 billion in FY24, with the share in global POL exports (HS 2710 to 2713) exports rising from 4.3 per cent in 2018 to 4.8 per cent in 2022. 30

4.19 Under non-POL products, exports of engineering goods, electronic goods and drugs &amp; pharmaceuticals increased in FY24 on a YoY basis. In contrast, agriculture and allied products, chemicals, plastics and textiles have witnessed a decline in exports. Over the past six years, the composition of exports across these categories has changed. Engineering goods dominated the merchandise exports in FY19, accounting for 25.3 per cent of the total exports. This trend remained the same, with engineering goods exports reaching USD 109.3 billion in FY24, with the share being the same at 25 per cent. Agri and allied products also maintained a steady

share. From USD 36.6 billion in FY19, their exports peaked at USD 52.7 billion in FY23 before slightly declining to USD 48.3 billion in FY24, holding around 11 per cent share in merchandise exports. Chemical and plastic exports experienced notable growth, rising from USD 31 billion in FY19 to USD 37.5 billion in FY24. Despite this increase in value, their share declined from 9.4 per cent in FY19 to 8.6 per cent in FY24. The textile sector witnessed a relative decline in prominence. Along with a decline in their exports from USD 37.5 billion in FY19 to USD 34.8 billion in FY24, their share in total exports also dropped significantly from 11.4 per cent to 8 per cent during the same period. This reduction, apart from reflecting the shifting priorities and emerging sectors within India's export framework, is also likely reflective of underlying challenges in the sector that need addressing.

4.20 India's share in world electronics exports (captured by incorporating HS chapters 84, 85, and 90) has improved from 0.63 per cent in 2018 to 0.88 per cent in 2022 31 . As such, India's rose from 28th in 2018 to 24th in 2022 in global electronics exports. The share of electronics goods in merchandise exports of India rose from 2.7 per cent in FY19 to 6.7 per cent in FY24.

4.21 India maintained a strong foothold in the drugs and pharmaceuticals sector. The share of the sector in India's exports grew from 5.8 per cent in FY19 to 6.4 per cent in FY24, with exports rising from USD 19.1 billion in FY19 to USD 27.9 billion in FY24.

## Merchandise imports

4.22 Despite high domestic demand due to the relatively strong growth of India's economy, merchandise imports contracted by 5.7 per cent in FY24, from USD 716 billion in FY23 to USD 675.4 billion in FY24. The moderation in merchandise imports was primarily driven by petroleum, crude and products, fertilisers, pearls, precious and semi-precious stones, organic and inorganic chemicals, and textile yarn fabric, among others. Owing to a rise in domestic demand, merchandise imports rose from USD 106.5 billion during April-May 2023 to USD 116 billion during April-May 2024.

4.23 Several important shifts in the composition of imports between FY23 and FY24 could be seen. Imports of capital goods saw an increase, which is welcome as it indicates a heightened demand for machinery, equipment, and other durable goods used in production processes, suggesting  potential  investments  in  industrial  infrastructure  or  technological  upgrades.  A marginal uptick in the share of consumer goods in merchandise imports reflects a stable but limited increase in the importation of finished products for direct consumption. The share of intermediate goods in merchandise imports also slightly rose in FY24, reflecting a continued need  for  semi-finished  products,  components,  or  materials  used  in  further  manufacturing processes.

## Services as a shining star in exports

4.24 India's services export in US Dollars terms expanded at a robust CAGR of more than 14 per cent over the last 30 years (between 1993 and 2022), significantly higher than India's merchandise export growth (10.7 per cent) and world services export growth (6.8 per cent). Accordingly, the share of India's services exports in world services exports has risen remarkably from 0.5 per cent in 1993 to 4.3 per cent in 2022. India is now the seventh-largest services exporting country globally, with a phenomenal rise from its 24th position in 2001. India ranks 2nd in the world in telecommunication, computer, and information services exports, 6th in personal,  cultural  and  recreational  services  exports,  8th  in  other  business  services  exports, 10th in transport services exports, and 14th in travel services exports. As noted by the RBI, healthy and steady growth in services exports has imparted strength to India's BoP position by offsetting a significant part of the country's merchandise trade deficit. 33

4.25 India's deep integration into the value chains of the global software industry has led to a change in the composition of its services exports basket. While the early 2000s was a period of business process outsourcing (BPOs) that provided cost-cutting back-end IT services, India now looks beyond such services. Data from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) shows that India went from providing back-end services in law, IT, and management in 2010 to providing upstream and high-value-added services in these fields by 2020. 34  The Russia-Ukraine conflict and global inflation pressured wages encouraged global players to look towards India to set up their back-office operations to balance their cost model. This gave rise to a sudden proliferation of the Global Capability Centres (GCCs). The growth in GCCs is reflected in the services BoP, with 'Other Business Services' being the second-largest contributor in services exports in FY24 (26 per cent), after IT services (48 per cent). The rising contribution of other business services

to overall services exports is shown by their achieving a CAGR of 18 per cent between FY20 and FY24. The share of software exports in overall services exports declined from 50 per cent in FY21 to 48 per cent in FY24. 35   Box IV.2 discusses the growth of GCCs in India in some detail.

## Box IV.2: Journey of Global Capability Centres in India

Origin of GCCs: In the last couple of years, more than 150 multinationals have set up their GCCs in India. 36  Starting with the humble beginning of offshoring by Texas Instruments by setting up its office in Bengaluru in 1985, India has come a long way to being at the epicentre of GCC growth. 37  In the 1990s, other companies followed suit, and many airlines and  technology  companies  started  their  operations  in  India.  These  were  called  'captive centres' earlier and have now come to be addressed as GICs (global in-house centres) or GCCs. In 2012, about 760 GCCs were operating out of India. In 2016, that number went over 1000, and as of March 2023, India houses over 1,600 GCCs.

Various agencies have projected that the number of GCCs would grow in the coming years, creating jobs as well. According to a PwC report, by 2028, the country is poised to have 2100 GCCs, with the market size of the centres touching USD 90 billion. 38  As per a study by Wizmatic 39 , GCCs presently employ 32 lakh people, primarily engineers and scientists. They generated a combined revenue of USD 46 billion in 2023 and are estimated to generate a total revenue of USD 121 billion by 2030, roughly 3.5 per cent of India's GDP. Out of this, USD 102 billion will represent export earnings.

Role of GCCs: GCCs provide bespoke services in operation, product development and innovation.  Today,  GCCs  operate  across  all  IT,  BPO,  engineering,  and  software  product development service lines, delivering complex work that requires a significant understanding of business context and imperatives. They have made a mark in key industry verticals such as banking and financial services, software, telecom and semiconductors, with a growing concentration in aerospace, automotive, oil and gas, healthcare and pharma.

39 The Economist (23 May 2024), 'Global firms are Tapping India's Workers like never before', https://tinyurl.com/37psdw3s

Government support for GCCs: Strategic interventions under various initiatives like 'Digital India' and policies for easing doing business have streamlined online approvals and licensing processes for GCCs. Initiatives like streamlined tax regulations and compliance procedures  for  foreign  companies  for  setting  up  GCCs,  flexible  labour  laws,  and  singlewindow clearance systems for faster approvals have eased the business process. Improved digital infrastructure (high-speed internet, data centres) has been a boon for GCC operations.

Various  States  are  undertaking  a  multi-pronged  approach  to  boost  the  GCC  ecosystem by  identifying  high-potential  industries.  For  example,  State  Governments  of  Karnataka, Telangana and Tamil Nadu have launched research and development (R&amp;D) policies to expand the GCC landscape in sectors such as auto and electric vehicles, electronics, pharma and life sciences in the states. These policies aim to develop innovation hubs in the States by leveraging the existing industry presence and the academic and R&amp;D ecosystem. For instance, Telangana contributes to over 30 per cent of India's pharma production and is home to more than 1,000 life sciences companies and over 200 FDA-approved sites for producing innovative and generic medicines. 40  The Karnataka Digital Economy Mission

(KDEM) 41  aims to increase the State's contribution to India's digital economy to USD 300 billion by 2026 by enabling holistic growth of the tech sectors and start-ups by deepening partnerships with industry players and developing tech clusters beyond the State's capital to achieve higher contribution. Consequently, leading technology companies have started operations in Mysuru, Mangalore and Hubballi clusters, generating employment for more than 5,000 people.

Partnership  with  Startups  to  support  global  technology  needs: As  per  a NASSCOM report, GCCs are leveraging India's vital engineering research and development service provider community, its mature start-ups, and its peer-GCC ecosystem. They have established more than 15 incubators, over 40 accelerators, and multiple partner programmes to drive collaboration with Indian start-ups. 42  Healthcare and pharma GCCs have witnessed an  increased  partnership  with  start-ups  and  academia  to  access  newer  technology.  The GCCs have explored various forms of collaboration, such as innovation labs, hackathons and start-up incubators.

Expansion to Tier-II cities: GCCs are increasingly evaluating tier-II towns to expand their  operations, influenced by the reverse migration seen during the pandemic and the cost arbitrage offered by such relatively under-penetrated markets. The recent thrust on infrastructure development in these cities has also added to their appeal. As per a CBRE research report, 43 , during H1 of 2023, about 22 per cent of GCC centres were set up in tier-II cities, driven by the availability of existing and fresh talent.

Rising  global  demand  for  India: While  US  and  Europe-based  MNCs  have  been establishing  their  capability  centres  for  a  long  time,  international  players  from  the  Asia Pacific  region,  especially  Japan  and  South  Korea,  have  begun  setting  up  their  R&amp;D/ innovation centres in India over the past few years. Although other countries with GCC presence have emerged recently, India remains a GCC favourite in a highly competitive global environment due to its ample talent endowment and cost advantage.

The way forward: Today,  GCCs  contribute  to  their  parent  organisations'  success  and propel India's economic growth. They account for more than 1 per cent of the country's GDP, and the share is expected to grow further. 44  As more global players eye India to set up their GCC operations, the government has a crucial role in facilitating their entry. Government support for identifying new business models for partnerships, simplifying the entry process, and emphasising trust and data security, among others, will further encourage the location of GCCs in India.

## India's rising Global Value Chains (GVC) participation

4.26 GVCs  refer  to  international  production  sharing,  where  operations  are  spread  across national borders (instead of being confined to the exact location), producing a complex product. In what has come to be called a period of 'hyperglobalisation' 45 , the early 2000s saw rapid GVC expansion worldwide. This led to exponential gains in trade, reductions in supply chain costs and deep interlinkages in trade across nations. A dramatic shift from 'hyperglobalisation' to 'slowbalisation' 46   occurred following the 2008 global financial crisis (GFC). Concerns about the risks and uncertainties surrounding GVCs were further amplified with shocks such as the China-USA trade war, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russia-Ukraine conflict. More recently, this  trend  has  begun  to  see  a  reversal.  WTO's  GVC  Development  Report  2023 47   showcases recovery in GVCs, underscored by a rise in the share of foreign export inputs and enhanced participation rates of economies worldwide.

4.27 In line with the global trend, India's GVC participation rose steadily through the 1990s and 2000s before the GFC, after which it started declining. For instance, the foreign valueadded content of India's exports rose from 10 per cent in 1995 to 22 per cent in 2009 (the second highest amongst BRICS nations, after China), reflecting increased fragmentation of production and integration into GVCs. 48 After the lull seen in the years succeeding the global financial crisis, India's GVC participation has begun to rev up again on the back of incentives provided through schemes such as the PLI and Districts as Exports Hub (DEH) initiative.

4.28 The evidence of India's enhanced global supply chain participation is reflected in increased investment by foreign firms in electronics, apparel and toys, automobiles and components, capital  goods  and  semiconductor  manufacturing  in  India.  India's  large  domestic  consumer market is an added attraction for firms setting up shop here. For example, Apple assembled 14 per cent of its global iPhones in India in FY24. Foxconn invested in the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to set up new manufacturing plants for components.

4.29 Asia is the primary beneficiary of shifting supply chains. India has received the most interest from firms (28 out of 130 firms) regarding setting up or expanding production facilities, followed by Vietnam, Mexico, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. 49

## Box IV.3: The trend in India's GVC participation and change in the sectoral composition

The WTO's World Integrated Trade Solutions (WITS) database shows that India's GVCrelated  trade 50 increased  nearly  four  times  from  USD  62.9  billion  in  2010  to  USD  233.1 billion  in  2022.  Essential  products  driving  India's  GVC  participation  include  coal  and petroleum, business services, chemicals, and transport equipment. India's GVC trade grew at a CAGR of 14.6 per cent between 2018 and 2022. This is higher than the CAGR of 13.3 per cent between 2014 and 2018 and 6.9 per cent between 2010 and 2014.

Over the years, the sectoral composition of India's GVC-related trade has changed markedly. Within the manufacturing sector, the share of low-technology manufacturing 52   has declined over the years, while the share of medium 53  and high-technology manufacturing 54  has been rising. The increase in medium technology manufacturing can also be seen in the shift toward industries such as coke and petroleum, transport equipment and primary and fabricated metals, which have a significant share in India's GVC-related trade.

54 High-technology manufacturing includes electrical and optical equipment, transport equipment and manufacturing, nec, and recycling.

outsourcing (BPO) services to high-value-added services, such as those provided by global capability centres (GCCs).

Previously, India's GVCs involved a higher level of forward participation, which resulted in lower value-addition for exports within the country. However, in recent years, India has begun to move downstream and export finished goods to the rest of the world. 55  This can be seen in the rise in the share of pure backward GVC participation from 13.8 per cent in 2019 to 16.3 per cent in 2022. Sectors such as food and beverages, electrical and optical equipment,  and  financial  intermediation,  among  others,  have  witnessed  a  remarkable increase in backward GVC participation. Even by stricter estimation, i.e., excluding coke, refined petroleum and nuclear fuel, the share of pure backward participation in gross trade increased from 12.1 per cent in 2019 to 14 per cent in 2022. In contrast, the share of pure forward GVC participation (or upstream participation) in trade has declined from 19.1 per cent in 2016 to 17.6 per cent in 2022 in sectors such as retail trade, coke, refined and nuclear fuel, chemicals and primary and fabricated metals, among others.

Rising backward GVC participation bodes well for India. The latest research by Professor Veeramani  and  Dhir 56   shows  that  greater  backward  GVC  participation  results  in  higher absolute levels of gross exports, domestic value-added, and employment.

Despite so much progress, India's GVC participation (GVC-related trade as per cent of gross trade at 40.3 per cent in 2022) is still lower not only in comparison to large economies such as the USA (43.7 per cent), UK (47.8 per cent) and Japan (46.6 per cent), but also its Asian counterparts, such as South Korea (56.2 per cent) and Malaysia (60 per cent).

GVCs and enhance participation, there is a need to develop quality trade infrastructure, integrate micro, small and medium enterprises in the GVC network, simplify procedures for entry and exit of small businesses, and work towards trade facilitation measures.

Finally,  it  is  worth  noting  that  India's  GVC  expansion  is  taking  place  in  an  era  that  is not  particularly  conducive  to  GVCs.  Countries  worldwide  are  embracing  mercantilism. Nonetheless, despite the rise in mercantilism, there is scope for collective country blocs to trade intensively with one another.  In this context, GVCs can help build self-reliance and promote shared trade gains amongst these country blocs.

## Box IV.4: Indian Districts as Export Hubs

Each district in the country holds economic potential comparable to that of a small country. They  can  become  export  hubs  using  their  unique  identities  and  prospects  in  the  global marketplace. To take this forward, the Districts as Export Hubs (DEH) initiative was launched in August 2019 to foster balanced regional development across all districts of the country. The objective was to select, brand, and promote the sale of products from each district in the domestic and international markets. Through the DEH initiative, the Government aims to boost manufacturing and exports from urban areas while focusing on generating interest and economic activity in the rural hinterland. India's Foreign Trade Policy 2023 reiterated the role of DEH in India's export efforts.

As  part  of  its  recent  initiative  under  DEH  -  Focus  @  75  initiative,  the  Government  has identified 75 districts across India to provide targeted support for boosting exports. Key events include Vanijya Saptah, a series of workshops aimed at educating and empowering local  exporters,  and  participation  in  the  Dubai  Expo  2020,  where  Indian  products  were showcased to a global audience. A notable success of the expo is the introduction of Ladakh's apricots  to  Dubai  supermarkets.  Additionally,  the  Marine  Buyer-Seller  Meet  connected Indian marine product exporters with international buyers, while marketing and branding workshops helped exporters enhance their product presentation.

The  DEH  initiative  provides  a  broad  base  to  promote  financial  inclusion  and  facilitate logistical  and  infrastructural  support  to  engage  all  districts  of  the  country  in  developing at  least  a  commodity  for  the  global  market  and  thus  promoting  exports.  The  bottom-up approach helps India establish a direct link between production units and meet national export obligations.

All States/UTs have established an institutional mechanism by constituting State Export Promotion Committees (SEPC) and District Export Promotion Committees (DEPC). District Export Action Plans have been prepared and updated from time to time by the DEPCs to identify bottlenecks and necessary interventions to support exporters and manufacturers in promoting the export of identified products/services. So far, 567 Districts have prepared

their Export Action Plans (DEAPs). Districts have identified 304 unique products spanning across 13 sectors across the country. Notably, 14 out of these 304 unique products have been identified as services strategically distributed across over 100 districts.

The  Government  is  also  promoting  e-commerce  exports  through  its  DEH  initiative, collaborating with relevant e-commerce partners, Export Promotion Councils, and relevant Government departments. The initiative focuses on educating MSMEs about e-commerce exports, enabling them to sell globally, and includes training and handholding on imaging and digital cataloguing of products. As a result of these collaborations, 10 outreach events were organised in Districts  export  outreach  events  in  Faridabad,  Moradabad,  Ludhiana, Jodhpur, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Jamshedpur, and Varanasi during the  first  quarter  of  2024.  These  events,  organised  with  leading  e-commerce  partners, provided valuable hand-holding, capacity-building, and training sessions for participating businesses, offering key insights and support to help them succeed in global markets.

The Government is taking further steps to enhance the performance of the scheme. For instance, the Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) has partnered with Exim Bank to boost exports under the ODOP (One District, One Product) and DEH initiative. This collaboration stems from an Exim Bank study that identified 59 middle export districts with export potential. Under the collaboration, the DGFT will be working with Exim Bank in 20 districts. These districts will receive support through Exim Bank's GRID program (Grassroots Initiatives for Development). The program aims to address sector-specific challenges and identify suitable beneficiaries for support. Exim Bank aims to prepare a detailed proposal outlining challenges and solutions for collaborative implementation.

## Changing landscape of India's global trade arrangements

4.30 Global  economic  growth  and  international  trade  are  passing  through  a  particularly challenging phase of uncertainty, as detailed in paras 4.4 to 4.8 above.  In this context, open, inclusive, predictable, non-discriminatory, and mutually beneficial trade can provide an impetus to economic growth. India advocates for a rule-based international trading system with these attributes with WTO at its core. In this spirit, India considers Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) an instrument of trade liberalisation and a complement to the multilateral trading system under WTO. Accordingly, the country has engaged with its trading partners/blocs to expand its export markets while ensuring better terms for essential imports to meet domestic demand in a costcompetitive manner.

4.31 After a gap of nearly 10 years, four new FTAs have been signed over the period 2021 to 2024. 57  These FTAs are with Mauritius (signed in February 2021), the UAE (February 2022), Australia (April 2022) and the European Free Trade Association or EFTA (March 2024). All

57  Before 2021, the last FTA signed was with Japan in February 2011, which came into force in August 2011.

these  FTAs  have  come  into  force  except  the  last  one.  Having  signed  FTAs  with  most  EastAsian  partners,  these  new  trade  engagements  focus  on  gaining  access  to  the  Western  and African markets, as well as potential partners having trade complementarity. India's young demography and growing middle-class population provide an attractive market for its Western FTA partners.

4.32 One of the major criteria for engaging with an FTA partner is to ensure that the trading partner is a natural partner in terms of trade complementarity. Academic literature on natural trading partners identifies factors that would promote robust trade between FTA partners and facilitate  deeper  economic  integration.  The  initial  trade  volume,  geographic  proximity,  and trade complementarity are prominent among them. 58

## India-Mauritius CECPA

4.33 Since  2005,  India  has  been  among  the  largest  trading  partners  of  Mauritius.  India's exports to Mauritius stood at USD 462.7 million in FY23, while Mauritius's exports to India were USD 91.8 million, taking the total trade to USD 554.5 million. Trade has grown by 168 per cent in the last 17 years, from FY06 to FY23. Petroleum products were the largest export item for India between 2007 and 2019 until the Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited supply  contract  was  terminated  in  mid-2019.  Other  Indian  exports  to  Mauritius  include pharmaceuticals, cereals, cotton, shrimps, prawns and bovine meat. Main Mauritian exports to India are vanilla, medical devices, needles, aluminium alloys, scrap paper, refined copper, men's cotton shirts, etc. 59

4.34 India and Mauritius signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Partnership Agreement (CECPA) in February 2021. The CECPA is the first trade Agreement signed by India with an African country. The agreement covers trade in goods, rules of origin, trade in services, Technical Barriers to Trade, Sanitary and Phytosanitary measures, etc. The Agreement covers 310  export  items  for  India,  including  foodstuffs  and  beverages,  agricultural  products,  etc. Mauritius benefits from preferential market access to India for its products such as frozen fish, speciality sugar, biscuits, fresh fruits, juices, mineral water, etc.

4.35 As regards trade in services, Indian service providers have access to around 115 subsectors  from  the  11  broad  service  sectors  such  as  professional  services,  computer-related services, research &amp; development, other business services, telecommunication, construction, distribution, education, environmental, financial, tourism &amp; travel related, recreational, yoga, audio-visual services, and transport services. India has offered trade access to around 95 subsectors from 11 broad services sectors, including professional services, R&amp;D, other business services, telecommunication, financial, distribution, higher education, environmental, health, tourism and travel-related, recreational, and transport services. 60

## India-UAE CEPA

4.36 The UAE can be classified as a natural trading partner, having been featured among India's top three trade partners for the past two decades. UAE has been India's largest export market for  gems  and  jewellery,  cereal,  and  fuel.  Through  the  UAE  CEPA  (Comprehensive  Economic Partnership Agreement), these labour-intensive products will receive preferential access. 61

4.37 The bilateral trade between India and the UAE in FY24 was USD 83.7 billion. The UAE is  India's second-largest export destination, with approximately USD 35.6 billion in exports in FY24. The UAE is also the eighth largest investor in India, with an estimated investment of USD 18 billion, whereas Indian investments in the UAE are estimated at around USD 85 billion 62 . The CEPA is expected to increase the bilateral trade in goods to USD 100 billion within five years of the signing and increase trade in services to USD 15 billion. The India-UAE CEPA

is likely to benefit about USD 26 billion worth of Indian products that are subjected to 5 per cent import duty by the UAE. UAE can also become a hub for sourcing India's capital goods and intermediates for further value-added exports to other African and European destinations. Also,  for  the  first  time  in  any  Trade  Agreement,  a  separate  Annex  on  pharmaceuticals  has been incorporated to facilitate access to Indian pharmaceutical products, especially automatic registration  and  marketing  authorisation  in  90  days  for  products  approved  by  developed country regulators, namely the United States (USFDA), the United Kingdom (UKMHRA), the European Union (EMA), and Japan (PMDA).

4.38 Further, India has included digital trade within the ambit of its FTA with UAE for the first  time,  which  will  help  leverage  India's  advantage  in  digital  payment  and  e-commerce services.  The  agreement  also  involves  government  procurement  and  data  usage  provisions, while completely safeguarding the provisions of General Financial Rules and the Orders issued thereunder, including Preference for 'Make in India' Order and MSME Preference policies.

## India-Australia ECTA

4.39 Unlike UAE, Australia did not have as large an initial trade volume with India. Even so, Australia's trade basket with India has a substantial complementarity, thus classifying it as a natural trading partner. 63   India imports resources and primary products from Australia and exports finished goods.

4.40 Australia was India's 13th largest trading partner in FY24, and India was Australia's 5th largest trading partner in 2023. India-Australia bilateral merchandise trade increased from USD 25 billion in FY22 to USD 26 billion in FY23. The India-Australia Economic Cooperation

63    The trade complementarity index indicates to what extent the export profile of the reporter matches or complements the import profile of the partner. A high index may suggest that two countries would benefit from increased trade (WITS, World Bank). The TCI for Australia and the UK were 60 and 67 per cent in 2021 for India.

and Trade Agreement (ECTA) estimated bilateral trade in goods and services for both countries to rise from USD 27.5 billion in 2021 to USD 45 billion in 5 years. 64

4.41 The  Agreement  is  likely  to  benefit  various  labour-intensive  sectors  of  India,  which were otherwise subjected to Australia's 5 per cent import duty on the majority of products earlier. It will result in immediate market access at zero duty to 98.3 per cent of tariff lines accounting for 96.4 per cent of India's exports to Australia in value terms. India is Australia's third largest services export market. Regarding market access to services, Australia has offered 135 sub-sectors to India, and India has offered 103 sub-sectors to Australia. The Agreement opens avenues for investment in computer-related services, telecom, construction, health &amp; environmental services. 65

## India-EFTA TEPA

4.42 The  thrust  of  the  India-EFTA  Trade  and  Economic  Partnership  Agreement  (TEPA) is  deeper  economic  engagement  with  the  EFTA  countries-  Switzerland,  Norway,  Iceland, and Liechtenstein. This is the first FTA of India with any European country. The successful conclusion of an FTA with this set of developed countries, is a significant positive signal to the  world,  showcasing  India's  firm  commitment  to  trade  liberalisation  at  a  time  of  rising protectionism across both developed and developing countries. It is an innovative and wellbalanced pact that covers two-way trade in goods and services as well as bilateral investments.

4.43 Further, India is also presently engaged in FTA negotiations with some of its trading partners; notable among these FTA negotiations are - (i) India-UK FTA, (ii) India-EU FTA, (iii) IndiaAustralia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), building on Ind-Aus ECTA, (iv)  India-Peru Trade Agreement, covering goods, services, and investment, (v) India-Eurasian Economic Union (India-EAEU) FTA and (vi) India-Sri Lanka Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement  (ECTA).    The  Government  reviews  FTAs  based  on  extensive  inter-ministerial  and industry consultations. Accordingly, reviews of its existing FTAs, namely, the India-South Korea CEPA and the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), have been initiated.

## Government initiatives on trade facilitation measures and reduction in logistics cost

4.44 The  Government  has  undertaken  various  measures  to  enhance  production  capacity, promote  exports  and  reduce  logistics  costs  involved  in  international  trade.  These  include setting export targets and monitoring these targets followed by course correction, provision of export credit insurance services for short-term as well as medium and long-term exports, and encouraging banks to provide affordable and adequate export credit to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) exporters, enabling them to explore new markets and diversify

existing products competitively, among others. The Government has also streamlined trade processes, enhancing transparency and promoting cooperation among stakeholders through initiatives  such  as  Turant, 66 Customs, 67 Single  Window  Interface  for  Facilitation  of  Trade (SWIFT), 68  pre-arrival data processing, e-Sanchit, 69  Coordinated Border Management, etc.

4.45 The  Central  Board  of  Indirect  Taxes  and  Customs  (CBIC)  has  undertaken  various technological  initiatives  to  facilitate  trade.  These  include  the  phased  implementation  of  an electronic  cash  ledger, 70 enabling  electronic  clearances  at  Land  Customs  Stations,  online submission  of  IFSC  Code,  use  of  Electronic  Certificates  of  Origin,  and  Electronic  Repairs Services Outsourcing to prolong the life of faulty or damaged electronic goods, among others. Department of Posts (DoP) has developed a Postal Bill of Export Automation System for the electronic  filing  and  processing  of  PBE,  under  which  an  exporter  is  not  required  to  visit  a Foreign Post Office and present an export parcel. In a transformative partnership, the CBIC and the DoP launched the Hub and Spoke Model, simplifying the export process, promoting small-scale exporters, and leveraging India's extensive global trade postal network. This scheme harnesses the vast postal network of 1.54 lakh post offices, using digital technology and apps, and eliminates intermediaries for seamless exports via postal services.

4.46 To boost efficiency and lower logistics costs, the Government launched the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan and the National Logistics Policy (NLP) in October 2021 and September 2022, respectively. Digital reforms, such as the Unified Logistics Interface Platform (ULIP) 71 and  the  Logistics  Data  Bank, 72 are  additional  measures  taken  towards  improving  logistics. Initiatives,  such  as  railway  track  electrification,  reduced  release  times  by  the  Land  Ports Authority of India (LPAI), and the launch of NLP Marine for port-related logistics were also undertaken. Since the launch of the NLP, over 614 industry players have registered on ULIP, 106 private companies have signed Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), 142 companies have submitted 382 use cases to be hosted on ULIP and 57 applications have been made live as of September 2023. 73

4.47 As a result of these initiatives, there has been an improvement in India's performance in the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia Pacific's (UNESCAP) Global Survey on Digital and Sustainable Trade Facilitation. 74  In the survey, India scored 93.5 per

69    e-Sanchit allows the trader to upload all supporting documents digitally for obtaining clearances, eliminating the need for the trader to approach PGAs (Participating Government Agencies) to obtain various clearances

70    The Electronic Cash Ledger (ECL) has enabled the importer, exporter, or any person liable to pay duty, fees, etc., to deposit an advance with the Government instead of transaction-wise payment as being done at present, which could be used to pay his liabilities under this Act or under any other law for the time being in force.

71    ULIP is designed to enhance efficiency and reduce the cost of logistics in India by creating a transparent, one-window platform that can provide real-time information on cargo movements to all stakeholders.

72    Logistics Data Bank integrates the information available with various agencies across the supply chain to provide detailed realtime information related to containerised EXIM logistics within a single window.

cent  in  2023  vis  a  vis  90.3  per  cent  in  2021.  India  scored  100  per  cent  in  four  key  areas: Transparency, Formalities, Institutional Arrangement and Cooperation, and Paperless Trade. Further,  the  country  has  witnessed  a  substantial  improvement  in  the  score  for  'Women  in Trade Facilitation' component from 66.7 per cent in 2021 to 77.8 per cent in 2023, indicating a commitment to gender inclusivity and women's empowerment in the trade sector.

4.48 Another  evidence  of  the  success  of  trade  facilitation  measures  is  reflected  in  the National Time Release Study (2023) 75  conducted by the CBIC. The study shows that the overall average import release time 76   has improved by 20 per cent in 2023 over 2022. The maximum improvement in the average release time was reported by Mundra (33 per cent) among seaports, Hyderabad (44 per cent) among Air Cargo Complexes (ACCs), and Tughlakabad (23 per cent) among Inland Container Depots.

4.49 The reduction in logistics cost is reflected in an improvement in India's rank on the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index (LPI), 77  which improved by six places to 38th in 2023 from 44th in 2018 out of 139 countries. With the introduction of cargo tracking, dwell time 78  in the eastern port of Visakhapatnam fell from 32.4 days in 2015 to 5.3 days in 2019. Additionally, India's position in international shipments climbed to 22 in 2023 from 44 in 2018 due to its modernisation and digitalisation efforts. India moved up five places in infrastructure score and four places up to 48th in logistics competence and equality. The Government aspires to secure a position within the top 25 countries on the index, which comprises 139 countries, by 2030. 79 Indian Ports' "Median Turn Around Time" has reached 0.9 days, which is better than the USA (1.5  days),  Australia  (1.7  days)  and  Singapore  (1.0  days),  as  per  the  World  Bank's  Logistics Performance Index (LPI) Report 2023. 80

4.50 The Sagarmala scheme has promoted port-led development by harnessing India's 7,500 km long coastline, 14,500 km of potentially navigable waterways and strategic location on key international maritime trade routes. The Ministry for Ports, Shipping and Waterways estimates India's total port capacity to increase from 2,600 MTPA (million tonnes per annum) to more

75    Available at: https://old.cbic.gov.in/resources/htdocs-cbec/implmntin-trade-facilitation/national-time-releasestudy15062023.pdf. National Time Release Study (NTRS) 2023 covers the import and export release time for 15 major ports, representing the four-port categories. The study covers 4 Seaports, 6 ACCa, 3 Inland Container Depot and 2 Integrated Check Posts; these geographically well-distributed ports cumulatively account for approximately 80 per cent of the bills of entry and 70 per cent of the shipping bills filed in the country.

76    Cargo  release  time  is  the  time  taken  from  the  arrival  of  the  cargo  at  the  customs  station  to  its  out-of-charge  for  domestic clearance in case of imports and arrival of the cargo at the customs station to the eventual departure of the carrier in case of exports.

78    As per the World Bank LPI Glossary, dwell time refers to the time spent at the same location from container arrival to departure. Dwell time applies to port, exports, import, or inland terminal facilities. Consolidated import and export dwell time is defined as the sum of dwell times at port and intermediate inland locations after the ship's unloading (imports) or before the container's loading on the ship (exports).

4.51 The Goods and Services Tax (GST) has played a remarkable role in reducing logistics costs. The 'One Nation, One Tax' regime has ensured that trucks do not have to wait for hours on state borders, which has reduced travel time by up to 30 per cent. This has reduced the logistics cost and increased the average distance trucks travel from 225 km before GST to 300325 km, as per a Ministry of Road Transport and Highways report. 83  This has been a great value, adding to the ease of doing business and the growth of manufacturing in the country. An NCAER study of December 2023 has shown that the logistics cost in the economy has declined by 0.8 to 0.9 percentage points of GDP between FY14 and FY22. 84

4.52 The improvement in India's logistics performance is also reflected at the State level. The 2023 Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) highlights a positive shift in stakeholders' perception  across  all  three  pillars  of  logistics  performance  services,  infrastructure  and regulatory  environment  in  2023  over  2019,  empowering  State  Governments  by  providing region-specific insights for informed decision-making and comprehensive growth. 85  A positive shift in stakeholder perception is attributed to multiple reform measures initiated by States and UTs over the past couple of years to improve their logistics eco-system, including formulation of logistics policy, development of supporting infrastructure and enhancing regulatory ease.

## FAVOURABLE CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE

4.53 The current account is a record of a country's international transactions with the rest of the world. Trade is the dominant component of India's current account. As discussed in para 4.13, the narrowing of the overall trade deficit and increasing remittances (refer to para 4.54 below) contributed to an improvement in the CAD in FY24. India's CAD narrowed to USD 23.2 billion (0.7 per cent of GDP) in FY24 from USD 67 billion (2 per cent of GDP) during the previous year. The improvement in CAD in FY24 is supported by the surplus in CAD recorded in  Q4  of  FY24  on  the  grounds  of  a  decline  in  merchandise  trade  deficit,  rising  net  services exports and increasing remittances. An analysis of India's CAD in relation to other nations reveals that India's CAD is relatively low (Chart IV. 21)

## Invisibles

4.54 Net services receipts increased from USD 143.3 billion during FY23 to USD 162.8 billion in  FY24,  primarily  on  account  of  rising  exports  of  software,  travel  and  business  services. Similarly,  the  net  private  transfer  receipts,  mainly  representing  remittances  by  Indians employed overseas, was USD 106.6 billion in FY24, against their level of USD 101.8 billion during the previous year. Net services exports and remittances contributed to the surplus on the invisible account, which cushioned the merchandise trade deficit.

4.55 Remittances are the second largest source of external financing after service exports, which  contributes  to  narrowing  the  CAD  and  has  always  been  a  stable  constituent  of  the BoP. According to the World Bank, India has the largest emigrant population and is the top remittance  recipient  country,  with  remittances  reaching  a  milestone  of  USD  120  billion  in 2023. 86  The increase in remittances was driven mainly by declining inflation and strong labour markets in the United States and Europe, the largest destination for India's skilled migrants, and other OECD destinations, as well as positive demand for skilled and less-skilled workers in the GCC countries (which, together, are the second largest destination for Indian migrants).

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;

4.56 The remittance flows have also benefited from the agreement with the UAE to promote the use of Dirhams and Rupees for cross-border transactions. Remittances to India are forecasted to grow at 3.7 per cent to USD 124 billion in 2024 and at 4 per cent to reach USD 129 billion in 2025. India's share in South Asian remittances increased to 64.5 per cent in 2023 from 63 per cent in 2022. 87

4.57 Remittances differ from FDI, which companies disinvest during financial uncertainties. In times of economic downturn, FDI is considered pro-cyclical and destabilising. Remittances are a stable source of finance that will remain in the economy and are directly used by recipients, contributing to the nation's growth. From a BoP perspective, remittances are permanent foreign currency inflows and help finance merchandise trade deficits, contributing to the narrowing of the CAD. For net importers such as India, higher remittances partially offset the goods trade deficit and stabilise the CAD.

## Box IV.5: Factors influencing inward remittances

The  robust  recovery  of  job  markets  in  the  high-income  countries  of  the  Organisation  for Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  following  the  onset  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic has been the key driver of remittances, particularly as employment growth during the recovery was more rapid for immigrants than for the native-born. However, the remittance growth was 7.5 per cent in 2023 compared to a historic peak of 24.4 per cent in 2022.

Some key factors influencing the extent of inward remittances to India are discussed below.

Remittances and oil prices: India meets a large part of its crude oil demand from imports, and a rise in global oil prices is a negative shock to the economy as it leads to a widening of CAD, an increase in inflation, and a weaker rupee. As reported in the Monetary Policy Report (October 2018), 'it is estimated that for every USD 1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude, India's current account deficit could widen by USD 0.8 billion'. However, the rise in global oil prices generally positively impacts the remittances received by the country, as

India's primary source of remittances is oil-exporting countries. An analysis of quarterly data on remittances and oil prices shows that there exists a positive correlation of 75.4 per cent between the two for India.

Chart IV.24 further corroborates this correlation, as periods of rise in oil prices are associated with higher remittances.

The  plausible  mechanism  is  as  follows:  an  increase  in  oil  prices  (positive  shocks)  can generate a sizable amount of oil revenues, leading to higher investments and growth in oilproducing countries. As a result, the demand for migrant workers increases, translating into higher remittance outflows. 88  On the other hand, persistently low oil prices (adverse shocks) can  hamper  economic  activities  in  oil-exporting  economies  by  decreasing  oil  revenues. Correspondingly,  the  demand  for  migrant  workers  decreases,  which  in  turn  can  reduce remittance outflows to migrant worker countries.

Remittances and exchange rate: A higher CAD results in an increase in the demand for foreign currency and an increase in the supply of domestic currency as firms and consumers buy more imports. This applies downward pressure to the exchange rate. On the other hand, remitters get better value in rupee terms when it depreciates in terms of foreign currencies, be it for UAE's Dirham, the US Dollar, the British Pound, or any other currency.

For every one USD a worker earns in distant lands, he returns an augmented amount after necessarily being converted according to the foreign land he works in. Hence, remittances exhibited a positive association with the exchange rate movement. An analysis of quarterly

data on remittances and exchange rate shows that there exists a positive correlation of 91 per cent for India. Chart IV.25 further corroborates this correlation, as periods of exchange rate depreciation are associated with higher remittances.

Outlook: The outlook for remittance in India for 2024 is strong, with the expectation that remittance growth will moderate to 3.7 per cent, taking remittance levels to USD 124 billion in 2024. The diversification of India's migrant pool between a large share of highly skilled migrants employed mostly in high-income OECD markets, and the less-skilled migrants employed in the GCC markets is likely to lend stability to migrants' remittances in the event of external shocks. India's efforts to link its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with source countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Singapore are expected to reduce costs and speed up remittances. 89

## CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCE

4.58 Stable capital inflows continue to finance the CAD. During FY24, net capital flows stood at USD 86.3 billion against USD 58.9 billion during the previous year, primarily driven by FPI flows and net inflows of banking capital (including NRI deposits).

4.59 The  net  FPI  flows  saw  a  significant  turnaround  in  FY24.  Supported  by  optimism surrounding India's growth story, progressive policy reform, economic stability, fiscal prudence and attractive investment avenues, India witnessed robust FPI inflows in FY24. Net FPI inflows stood at USD 44.1 billion during FY24 against net outflows in the preceding two years. This is the highest level of FPI inflow after FY15. India received the highest equity inflows among

89  Migration and Development Brief 40, World Bank

emerging market peers during FY24. Financial services,  automobile  and  auto  components, healthcare,  and  capital  goods  were  the  significant  sectors  attracting  equity  inflows  during FY24. The recent inclusion of India's Sovereign Bonds in the JP Morgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets 90  is expected to contribute to higher debt inflows going forward and will likely spur demand for further exposure to India.

4.60 The  UNCTAD  World  Investment  Report  2024 91   highlights  that  global  FDI  declined marginally by 2 per cent to USD 1.3 trillion in 2023 from USD 1.4 trillion in 2022. Weakening growth  prospects,  economic  fracturing  trends,  trade  and  geopolitical  tensions,  industrial policies and supply chain diversification are reshaping FDI patterns, causing some multinational enterprises (MNEs) to adopt a cautious approach to overseas expansion. International project finance and cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) were especially weak in 2023. M&amp;As, which mostly affect FDI in developed countries, fell by 46 per cent in value. Project finance, important for infrastructure investment, was down 26 per cent. Tighter financing conditions, investor uncertainty, volatility in financial markets and tighter regulatory scrutiny were the principal  causes  of  the  decline.  However,  Greenfield  investment  project  announcements provided a bright spot, with the number of projects increasing by 2 per cent, with the growth concentrated in manufacturing.

4.61 The decline in global FDI flows has also impacted FDI flows to India. Net FDI inflows 93 to India declined from USD 42.0 billion during FY23 to USD 26.5 billion in FY24. However, gross FDI inflows moderated only by 0.6 per cent from USD 71.4 billion in FY23 to just under USD 71 billion in FY24. In other words, there was no change in investor interest in India. The contraction in net inflows was primarily due to a surge in repatriation/disinvestment due to many profitable exits. A market that allows investors to take profits and exit their investments is a healthy one. That is why the repatriation of investment increased from USD 29.3 billion in FY23 to USD 44.5 billion in FY24. The decline in FDI inflows in recent years is also attributable to  higher  interest  rates  in  developed  countries  and  attractive  exits  out  of  India  due  to  the buoyant stock market.

## An examination of change in trend and composition of FDI flows

## FDI in the industry vs services sector

4.62 A close examination of the FDI equity inflows into major sectors reveals that FDI inflow into the industry and services sectors 94  has weakened in recent years. In fact, for both these sectors, the FDI-to-GDP ratio has dipped below pre-pandemic levels. The share of industry sectors' FDI in GDP declined from 0.62 per cent in FY20 to 0.39 per cent in FY24. During the same period, the share of the services sector in GDP fell from 0.87 per cent to 0.69 per cent.

## Physical FDI vs Digital FDI

4.63 FDI inflows can be divided into physical and digital for further analysis.  Physical FDI includes  sectors  such  as  automobiles,  pharmaceuticals,  and  construction,  while  digital  FDI includes computer services, telecommunications, consultancy services, and information and broadcasting. 95  A few years ago (FY14), physical FDI was about three times the value of digital FDI. Owing to a rise in foreign investment in sectors such as software and hardware, consultancy services, and telecommunications, among others, digital FDI witnessed an increase, coupled with a relative decline in physical FDI.

4.64 Nomura's Global Market Research May 2024, 'Asia's New Flying Geese', highlights that rising protectionism and geopolitical tensions have triggered the stagnation of physical FDI. One factor exacerbating this trend is the growing prevalence of non-equity modes of international production,  such  as  contract  manufacturing,  third-party  outsourcing  or  franchising.  Under these  scenarios,  while  economies  may  become more integrated into GVCs, this may not be reflected in the FDI data. During the pandemic, there was a surge in the share of digital services in total FDI owing to the prevalence of work-from-home culture and the availability of efficient digital infrastructure. As a result, the share of digital FDI in total FDI rose from 46.6 per cent in FY17 to 69.2 per cent in FY21. However, both digital and physical FDI have been falling in recent times. The fall in digital FDI has much to do with tech start-ups. Following a big increase during the pandemic, global flows into tech start-ups have fallen, a global trend in flows that is mirrored in India as well.

## Actual FDI vs intentions

4.65 The declining FDI flows to India are at odds with India gaining market share in global trade in goods and services exports. In this context, an exercise was undertaken to understand the relationship between FDI inflows and investment intentions. Two data sources have been used to estimate intentions. One is the UNCTAD data on announced greenfield FDI projects; the other is CMIE's announced foreign private sector projects. 96

<!-- image -->

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;

96    The UNCTAD data only refers to greenfield investments, while the CMIE database includes different sectors. UNCTAD records data when there is a clear indication that jobs and new capex will be created, while CMIE includes projects even before essential licenses or land has been obtained/acquired or the funding has been tied up.

4.66 Over time, there  has  been  a  significant  change  in  the  trend  in  investment  intentions across  sectors.  While  investment  intentions  in  industries  such  as  computers  and  chemicals have softened, investment intentions in new and futuristic sectors are increasing. 97  In recent quarters,  investment  intentions  in  new  and  futuristic  sectors,  such  as  renewables,  artificial intelligence, data centres, EVs and batteries, green hydrogen, and semiconductors, have rapidly risen. India was a leading destination for AI-related FDI in 2022, receiving 122 AI-related FDI projects in 2022, with multinational companies such as ABB, Accenture, Deloitte, IBM, and Microsoft announcing investments in the country. 98  According to research by NASSCOM, India is an attractive destination for AI investment due to its relatively low operating costs and the world's second-largest pool of highly skilled AI, machine learning, and big data workers. 99

4.67 A detailed examination of CMIE Investment Intentions and UNCTAD data on greenfield projects reveals that a strong correlation of more than 56 per cent exists between these data sources. Chart IV.30a shows that investment intentions have been a good predictor of future FDI inflows. FDI inflows followed the same direction as CMIE Investment Intentions till FY15; however, in FY16, the trend diverged.

4.68 An  estimation  of  FDI  concentration  using  the  Hershman-Herfindahl  Index  (HHI) 100 highlights a positive correlation between total FDI inflows and the concentration index, which implies that in years in which the Indian economy witnessed a surge in FDI inflows, FDI was concentrated in a few sectors only and was not broad-based across sectors, and vice-versa.

4.69 India has a well-established infrastructure to attract FDI in select sectors, i.e., greenfield projects such as renewables, digital services such as telecommunications, software and hardware, and consultancy services. However, this may be different across the board. Therefore, where investment intentions are high, the sectors must be made more accessible for investments. Notably, the focus must remain on improving the ease of doing business across sectors and extend beyond sectors attractive to FDI alone. While several low-hanging fruits with respect to the 'Ease of Doing Business' have been plucked already over the years, further work may lie in details across all levels of government - national, state and local - and across regulators.

4.70 An article in Bloomberg in April 2024 101  noted that India was not competing with other developing nations only to attract FDI. It is competing with advanced nations who now actively and  aggressively  pursue  industrial  policies  that  privilege  domestic  investment  by  dangling subsidies to businesses to prevent them from investing abroad and to entice other overseas investors  who  might  otherwise  consider  emerging  nations  like  India.  Educated  labour  and a  skilled  workforce coupled with a vibrant R&amp;D culture are important magnets, apart from

political  stability,  policy  predictability  and  stability,  reasonable  duties  and  taxes,  dispute resolution mechanisms and ease of repatriation. India has made considerable progress in many of these areas over the years. There may be unfinished work in other areas. But, above all, the route to sustained investor interest and consequent accumulation of knowledge and know-how in India may lie through better educational and skill outcomes.

4.71 The box below discusses how increased FDI inflows from China can help in increasing India's global supply chain participation along with a push to exports.

## Box IV.6: China Plus One strategy

Over the last five years, a seismic change has occurred in the global manufacturing realm, with major multinational companies, including Apple and others, looking to 'de-risk' themselves from China, which was traditionally known as the 'world's factory'. This shift is primarily due to disruptions caused by COVID-19, growing tensions between the US and China, and rising costs of doing business in China. As a result, several companies have adopted a 'China plus one strategy' to reduce their reliance on China for high-tech electronic products and components. This approach involves supply chain decisions to decrease their risk exposure to China. For example, over 90 per cent of manufacturers in North America surveyed by the Boston Consulting Group in 2023 moved some or all of their production to other countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam, suggesting a move away from China. 102

Can India benefit from this 'China plus one' strategy? The appeal of India lies in its large domestic consumer market, which makes it attractive for companies to set up operations there. In the electronics sector, there is a focus on smartphone manufacturing and assembly. The Government's PLI scheme, including tax breaks and subsidies, plays a significant role in attracting companies. The rise in India's domestic smartphone demand is also a key factor in companies' decisions to invest there. For instance, Apple assembled USD 14 billion worth of iPhones in India during FY24, constituting 14 per cent of its global iPhone production. 103 Foxconn has started production of Apple mobile phones in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. 104

While India may not be an immediate beneficiary of the trade diversion from China, it has witnessed a substantial increase in its electronic exports over time. The implementation of the PLI scheme has been a key driver of this growth. For instance, India's electronic exports to the US have transitioned from a trade deficit of USD 0.6 billion in FY17 to a trade surplus of USD 8.7 billion in FY24, underscoring a significant increase in value addition. Within the electronics sector, the category that has experienced the most growth is mobile phones, with exports to the US rising from USD 2.2 billion in FY23 to USD 5.7 billion in FY24.

As India looks to deepen its involvement in Global Value Chains (GVCs), it will look to the successes and strategies of East Asian economies. These economies have typically pursued

102  Boston Consultancy Group article, 'Harnessing the Tectonic Shifts in Global Manufacturing', https://tinyurl.com/bnrcrddz. 103    India Briefing, 'Apple's Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers in India', dated 17 April 2024,  https://tinyurl. com/357mv7hy

two main strategies: reducing trade costs and facilitating foreign investment. Given that GVCs are designed to minimise costs, countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan have focused on lowering their trade costs over time. For India, improving logistical efficiency has been a key focus, as evidenced by a noticeable rise in India's score on the World Bank's LPI (as discussed in para 4.49). The second strategy, focused on investment facilitation, includes actions to increase and stabilise foreign investment. The PLI scheme, for example, encourages high-quality foreign investment by offering a market-linked incentive system for companies to comply with.

Over the medium term, India is focusing on integrating its value chain with that of the West, particularly in sectors like renewable energy and advanced technology, including artificial intelligence,  semiconductors,  and  next-generation  telecommunications.  This  strategy  is being pursued through agreements such as the Australia-India Free Trade Agreement and the US-India Clean Energy Initiative. As a result, the trading patterns within these sectors are starting to develop. For example, the tariff classifications for environmentally friendly technology, such as solar water heaters, waste recycling devices, and wind turbines, show an increase in exports to the USA from USD 199.2 million in FY20 to USD 326.9 million in FY24 105 .  Further, leading American and European companies in the renewable energy sector, such as First Solar, Vesta, and Scatec, have established their operations in India to take advantage of the growing demand for green technologies.

Will China plus one result in a total movement of trading relations away from China? This may not be the case. Take, for example, nations like Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan and Korea, which were direct beneficiaries of the US's trade diversion from China. Even while these nations increased their share of exports to the US, they also displayed a concomitant rise in Chinese FDI. 106  Therefore, the world cannot completely look past China, even as it pursues China plus one.

India faces two choices to benefit from China plus one strategy: it can integrate into China's supply chain or promote FDI from China. Among these choices, focusing on FDI from China seems more promising for boosting India's exports to the US, similar to how East Asian economies did in the past. Moreover, choosing FDI as a strategy to benefit from the China plus one approach appears more advantageous than relying on trade. This is because China is India's top import partner, and the trade deficit with China has been growing. As the US and Europe shift their immediate sourcing away from China, it is more effective to have Chinese companies invest in India and then export the products to these markets rather than importing from China, adding minimal value, and then re-exporting them. Further,

106    Sourced from the presentation made by Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research Department, IMF at NCEAR, India Policy Forum on 2 July 2024, 'CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM: How Geo-Economic Fragmentation is Reshaping the World'

a recent research note from the Rhodium Group points out, 'China's dominance over so many product categories creates, first and foremost, a risk of economic coercion, where the government restrains access to crucial inputs for political leverage.' 107   The same brief also notes, 'Brazil and Turkey have raised barriers to imports of Chinese EVs, but enacted measures to attract Chinese FDI in the sector.' European nations, too, have decided to follow a  similar  approach 108 .  Hence,  it  is  imperative  that  India  finds  the  right  balance  between importing goods from China and importing capital (FDI) from China.

## Comfortable Foreign Exchange Reserves

4.72 A moderation in the CAD amidst large capital inflows enabled the addition of foreign exchange reserves (FER) in FY24. The buffer of FER insulates domestic economic activity from global spillovers. These reserves act as a cushion and provide liquidity, ensuring India can meet its  external obligations. During FY24, India's FER increased by USD 68 billion, the highest increase among major foreign exchange reserves-holding countries. FER stood at USD 653.7 billion on 21 June 2024, enough to cover more than 10 months of imports projected for FY25 and more than 98 per cent of total external debt outstanding at the end of March 2024.

## Exchange Rates

4.73 Despite  FY24  being  marked  by  geopolitical  risks,  rising  interest  rates  and  volatile commodity prices, the US economy exhibited resilience with positive economic indicators such as a tight labour market and upbeat consumer sentiments. These factors contributed to drawing global funds to US treasury markets as there was a higher demand for greenback on safe-haven appeal. In FY24, the US Dollar gained against virtually every major peer. The Rupee also came under  depreciation  pressure.  However,  INR  was  one  of  the  least  volatile  major  currencies. Further, it exhibited the lowest volatility in FY24 compared to the previous years. An estimation of volatility using the coefficient of variation (CV) highlights that CV was 0.58 during FY24, much lower than in the past years. The relative stability of the rupee, despite a stronger US dollar and elevated US treasury yields, reflects the strength of the Indian economy's sound macroeconomic fundamentals, financial stability, and improvements in external position. In the future, robust foreign inflows and comfortable trade deficits are expected to keep the rupee within a comfortable range.

4.74 The Rupee/USD exchange rate was in the range of ₹82-83.5/USD in FY24, depreciating against USD by only 2.9 per cent during FY24. The Rupee depreciated by 6.9 and 6.8 per cent against Pound Sterling and Euro, respectively, in FY24. However, it appreciated by 3.5 per cent against Japanese Yen during the period.

4.75 The  exchange  rate  of  the  INR  is  market-determined.  The  RBI  regulates  the  foreign exchange market to ensure its orderly functioning and development and intervenes only to curb undue volatility in the INR. It has managed to contain INR volatility and keep foreign exchange markets stable.  Recently, it announced various measures to diversify and expand the sources of forex funding to mitigate exchange rate volatility and dampen global spillovers. For example, the regulatory regime relating to FPI investment in debt flows has been revised to encourage foreign investment in Indian debt instruments.

However, REER appreciated by 0.8 per cent in FY24. In May 2024, NEER at 92.2 and REER at 104.7 recorded appreciation of 0.03 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively.

4.77 The box below discusses the impact of exchange rate changes on the Indian economy through the trade channel as well as the financial channel.

## Box IV.7: Trade and Financial channels of the Exchange rate

Historically, a depreciated currency has been a key driver of export growth. The Marshal Lerner  conditions,  if  met,  suggest  that  currency  depreciation  can  stimulate  an  increase in net exports by reducing export costs and increasing import prices. This 'trade' channel of  the  exchange  rate  has  been  well-documented  for  India.  However,  the  exchange  rate also influences the external sector through a 'financial' channel. Theory suggests that the financial channel of the exchange rate can potentially counterbalance the gains (or losses) made through the trade channel.

A weak Rupee can affect the Balance of Payments (BoP) by changing the supply and cost of  foreign  funding.  For  instance,  depreciation  can  reduce  the  creditworthiness  of  local borrowers if they have Rupee-denominated assets and borrow in foreign currencies. This could raise the cost of foreign lending and lead to a net capital outflow. Globally, appreciation in domestic currencies (against the dollar) has increased cross-border banking capital flows. 110 However, Kearns and Patel (2016) show that the financial channel of the exchange rate is generally more potent in EMEs, where unhedged foreign currency exposures are more likely to be present. 111

109    NEER is the weighted average of bilateral nominal exchange rates of the home currency in terms of foreign currencies. The REER is defined as a weighted average of nominal exchange rates adjusted for relative price differential between domestic and foreign countries.

111  Banerjee, R., Hofmann, B., &amp; Mehrotra, A. N. (2020). Corporate investment and the exchange rate: The financial channel.

Over the last two decades, India's FDI and equity portfolio inflows have totalled about 2.5 per cent of GDP annually (IMF, 2023). 112  In general, inflows to the capital account increased by 65 per cent between FY-14 and FY-24. Therefore, in the context of India's large and growing financial account with the rest of the world, whether the Rupee should remain competitive is a question to ponder.

To answer this question, the two different channels of the exchange rate were estimated using  a  trade-weighted  exchange  rate  and  a  debt-weighted  exchange  rate.  The  tradeweighted Nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) provided by the RBI is used to capture the trade channel. The financial channel is captured by a debt-weighted exchange rate (DWER), which is constructed as an arithmetic average of the Rupee against major foreign currencies, weighted by their share in the composition of external debt.

In theory, the net BoP must equate to zero as trade surpluses (deficits) equate to capital account deficits (surpluses). However, in practice, countries report net Bop deficits/surpluses with rare instances of BoP equilibrium. Literature explains BoP disequilibria as a monetary disequilibrium and as the result of excess supply or demand for currency. 113  Therefore, to study the extent to which the two channels (trade and financial) counteract the other in the presence of currency movement, the dependent variable used here is net BoP.

An auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is deployed to capture the separate channels of a Rupee depreciation/appreciation on net Balance of Payments (BoP). The problem of endogeneity is controlled for in an ARDL framework in the absence of autocorrelation of errors. Further, multicollinearity is also not a significant issue as lags and differences of the variables are used.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

The data used is at a quarterly frequency between Q1 of FY12 to Q3 of FY24. The dependent variable  is  the  net  balance  of  payment  in  nominal  terms  calculated  as  Ln  (BoP  Credit)/ (BoP Debit); DWER represents the debt-weighted exchange rate. The coefficients δ i and β i indicate  the  elasticity  of  net  BoP  to  changes  in  the  debt  channel  of  the  exchange  rate and the trade channel of the exchange rate. X t includes  control  variables  such  as  World imports, repo rate, commodity prices, domestic demand, GDP deflator and a dummy for the COVID-19 years (March 2020 to March 2022). Optimal lags for the regressors are chosen according to the AIC criterion.

Dependent variable - Net BoP

| Regressor   | Long run Elasticity   |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| DWER        | 0.16*                 |
| NEER        | -0.7*                 |

'*' denotes significance at the 10 per cent level

The results indicate that India's trade channel is stronger than the financial channel. Over the long run, the net effect of an appreciation is negative ( -0.7 + 0.16). Thus, a per cent appreciation of the Rupee results in a net decline in the BoP by 0.54 per cent.

112  IMF, 2024 India's Financial System: Building the Foundation for Strong and Sustainable Growth

113  See for instance, Frenkel, J., &amp; Mussa, M. (1985). Asset Markets, Exchange Rates and the Balance of Payments, Handbook of International Economics, Volume II (eds.), Ronald Jones and Peter Kenen; Johnson, H, G. (1958). Towards a General Theory of the Balance of Payments.

In  addition  to  conducting  post-estimation  checks  for  serial  correlation  and  parameter stability (CUSUM test), robustness checks were performed by studying the variables in a dynamic OLS framework. The result of the robustness check is provided below:

Dependent variable - Net BoP

| Regressor   | Long run Elasticity   |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| DWER        | 0.12**                |
| NEER        | -1.01**               |

'**' denotes significance at the 5 per cent level

The results outline that a competitive Rupee continues to boost the BoP as the benefits received through the trade channel outweigh the costs incurred in the financial channel. As noted by Longaric 2022, India's high trade openness and low share of external debt mean that the trade channel effect of currency fluctuations dominates the financial channel effect. This contrasts with other EMEs, such as Brazil and the Philippines, whose financial channel effect dominates the trade effect.

## INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION (IIP)

4.78 The Net IIP 114  position determines whether a country is a net creditor or debtor nation by measuring the difference between its external assets and liabilities. As of the end of March 2024, Indian residents' overseas financial assets at USD 1,028.3 billion were higher by USD 109.7 billion or 11.9 per cent compared to the level as of March 2023, mainly due to a rise in reserve assets, currency and deposits, overseas direct investment, trade credit and advances and loans. Reserve assets at USD 646.4 billion, accounting for around 62.9 per cent of India's international financial assets, increased by 11.8 per cent over the same period.

4.79 International liabilities at USD 1,390 billion as of the end of March 2024 were higher by USD 104.3 billion (8.1 per cent) as compared to the level in March 2023. The rise was attributed mainly  to  an  increase  in  portfolio  investment,  loan,  direct  investment  and  other  accounts payable. The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities was 51.1 per cent as of March 2024.

4.80  Thus, the net claims of non-residents in India, valued at USD 361.7 billion as of the end of March 2024, declined by USD 5.5 billion over the level of March 2023. India's international financial assets covered 74 per cent of international financial liabilities as of the end of March 2024.

## STABLE EXTERNAL DEBT POSITION

4.81 The current account can also be expressed as the difference between national (both public and private) savings and investment.  A current account deficit may, therefore, reflect a low level of national savings relative to the desired level of investment. External debt, by supplementing domestic savings, helps countries grow faster. In developing economies, high economic growth is typically associated with high external debt and vice-versa. However, an unsustainable large stock of external debt can potentially create vulnerabilities and dent growth prospects.

4.82 India has managed its external debt prudently with the overarching objective of keeping the  current  account  deficit  within  sustainable  limits  and  encouraging  non-debt  creation  of external finance. India's external debt has been sustainable over the years, as evident in chart IV.38 below. The external debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.7 per cent at the end of March 2024 from 19.0 per cent at the end of March 2023. The share of short-term debt (with original maturity of up to one year) in total external debt declined to 18.5 per cent at the end of March 2024 from 20.6 per cent at the end of March 2023. The ratio of FER to total debt stood at 97.4 per cent as of March 2024.

4.83 Comparing various debt vulnerability indicators of India with peer countries for 2022 indicates that India is in a better position with relatively low levels of total debt as a percentage of Gross National Income (GNI) and short-term external debt as a percentage of total external debt. The comfortable level of FER offers additional comfort.

## OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES

4.84  Though ongoing geopolitical headwinds impacted India's merchandise exports, lowering international commodity prices ensured a lower trade deficit in FY24 than in FY23. A  narrowing  merchandise  trade  deficit  and  rising  service  exports  have  improved  the  CAD, ending with a surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP in Q4 of FY24. In the coming years, India's trade deficit is expected to decline further as the PLI scheme is expanded and India creates a globally competitive manufacturing base in several product categories. Further, the recently signed FTAs are expected to increase the global market share of the country's exports. Various international agencies and RBI expect the CAD to GDP to moderate to below one per cent for FY24, driven by growing merchandise and services exports and resilient remittances.

4.85 However, the risks to the performance of India's external sector are on the downside due  to  the  persistence  of  current  geopolitical  tensions  and  policy  uncertainty.  Some  of  the challenges are mentioned below: -

-  Fall in demand from major trading partners: As per the DGCIS data, the US was India's  second-largest  trading  partner  in  FY24  after  China.  However,  the  USA's  overall import volume declined by 1.7 per cent in 2023 compared to a growth of 8.6 per cent in 2022, as  per  OECD. This significantly influenced export growth in trading partners, including

India. 115  Rising protectionism is another risk that could undermine trade recovery in 2024 and 2025.

-  Rise  in  trade  cost: Attacks  on  shipping  in  the  Red  Sea  and  drought  in  the  Panama Canal  have  resulted  in  trade  flows  being  re-routed,  increasing  journey  time  and  costs as  mentioned  in  para  4.8  above.  India's  merchandise  trade  relies  heavily  on  maritime trade, so disturbances in major shipping routes can impact its economy. A CRISIL report 116 highlighted that the Red Sea crisis has impacted the Middle East's fertiliser exports to India as imports of the Muriate of Potash from Jordan and Israel have been affected.
-  Commodity price volatility: Fluctuations in commodity prices, especially for critical imports like oil, metals, and agricultural products, can impact India's trade balance and inflation  levels.  Disappointing  global  growth  presents  a  downside  risk,  especially  for industrial commodities. Additional trade restrictions could push food prices higher.
-  Trade policy changes: Changes in trade policies by major trading partners or geopolitical developments can affect India's export opportunities and market access. As per the WTO's Trade Monitoring Report, November 2023 117 , the pace of WTO members' implementation of new export restrictions has increased significantly since 2020. 75 export restrictions on food, feed and fertilisers are still in place globally, in addition to 20 COVID-19-related export restrictions. For 2023, the trade covered by import restrictions in force was estimated at USD 2,480 billion, representing almost one-tenth of total world imports.

4.86 It is critical to explore what these changing paradigms mean for India. Policies need to be a mix that straddles security concerns with economic considerations. India's push towards manufacturing in complex and niche sectors through schemes such as PLI and Make in India aims  to  balance  these  goals.  On  the  other  hand,  India's  edge  in  services  will  catalyse  our globalisation over the coming years. A recent paper by the Peterson Institute for International Economics 118 , asserts that globalisation in services is ongoing, even as we are past the era of hyperglobalised trade in goods. This implies that the global demand for India's services sector exports is here to stay.

4.87 India  is  simultaneously  working  towards  unlocking  the  potential  gains  from  growing integration  by  augmenting  the  logistics  front.  This  is  evident  from  the  large  infrastructure deals which have been signed to ramp up trade. For instance, the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is expected to shorten trade time for shipments to Russia and Europe.  Another  major  joint  infrastructure  deal,  the  India-Middle  East  Europe  corridor (IMEC), will connect Asia with Europe via ports and railroads. Similarly, there is a concerted effort towards striking trade agreements with countries spanning geographies.

4.88 Ultimately, India needs to focus on improving its competitiveness in many product areas. For example, India has tremendous potential in becoming a large global exporter in agricultural commodities. Fostering stronger regional trade ties and adding more markets for Indian goods will help mitigate global demand fluctuations. In an era when global economic growth is likely to be buffeted by geopolitical tensions and protectionism, growing India's exports of goods and services will be a stiffer challenge than before. Product safety and quality consciousness in the private sector and policy stability in the public sector are obvious starting points to turn the challenge into an opportunity.
