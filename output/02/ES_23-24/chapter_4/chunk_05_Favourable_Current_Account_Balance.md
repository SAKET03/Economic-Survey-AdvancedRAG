## FAVOURABLE CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE

4.53 The current account is a record of a country's international transactions with the rest of the world. Trade is the dominant component of India's current account. As discussed in para 4.13, the narrowing of the overall trade deficit and increasing remittances (refer to para 4.54 below) contributed to an improvement in the CAD in FY24. India's CAD narrowed to USD 23.2 billion (0.7 per cent of GDP) in FY24 from USD 67 billion (2 per cent of GDP) during the previous year. The improvement in CAD in FY24 is supported by the surplus in CAD recorded in  Q4  of  FY24  on  the  grounds  of  a  decline  in  merchandise  trade  deficit,  rising  net  services exports and increasing remittances. An analysis of India's CAD in relation to other nations reveals that India's CAD is relatively low (Chart IV. 21)

## Invisibles

4.54 Net services receipts increased from USD 143.3 billion during FY23 to USD 162.8 billion in  FY24,  primarily  on  account  of  rising  exports  of  software,  travel  and  business  services. Similarly,  the  net  private  transfer  receipts,  mainly  representing  remittances  by  Indians employed overseas, was USD 106.6 billion in FY24, against their level of USD 101.8 billion during the previous year. Net services exports and remittances contributed to the surplus on the invisible account, which cushioned the merchandise trade deficit.

4.55 Remittances are the second largest source of external financing after service exports, which  contributes  to  narrowing  the  CAD  and  has  always  been  a  stable  constituent  of  the BoP. According to the World Bank, India has the largest emigrant population and is the top remittance  recipient  country,  with  remittances  reaching  a  milestone  of  USD  120  billion  in 2023. 86  The increase in remittances was driven mainly by declining inflation and strong labour markets in the United States and Europe, the largest destination for India's skilled migrants, and other OECD destinations, as well as positive demand for skilled and less-skilled workers in the GCC countries (which, together, are the second largest destination for Indian migrants).

4.56 The remittance flows have also benefited from the agreement with the UAE to promote the use of Dirhams and Rupees for cross-border transactions. Remittances to India are forecasted to grow at 3.7 per cent to USD 124 billion in 2024 and at 4 per cent to reach USD 129 billion in 2025. India's share in South Asian remittances increased to 64.5 per cent in 2023 from 63 per cent in 2022. 87

4.57 Remittances differ from FDI, which companies disinvest during financial uncertainties. In times of economic downturn, FDI is considered pro-cyclical and destabilising. Remittances are a stable source of finance that will remain in the economy and are directly used by recipients, contributing to the nation's growth. From a BoP perspective, remittances are permanent foreign currency inflows and help finance merchandise trade deficits, contributing to the narrowing of the CAD. For net importers such as India, higher remittances partially offset the goods trade deficit and stabilise the CAD.

## Box IV.5: Factors influencing inward remittances

The  robust  recovery  of  job  markets  in  the  high-income  countries  of  the  Organisation  for Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  following  the  onset  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic has been the key driver of remittances, particularly as employment growth during the recovery was more rapid for immigrants than for the native-born. However, the remittance growth was 7.5 per cent in 2023 compared to a historic peak of 24.4 per cent in 2022.

Some key factors influencing the extent of inward remittances to India are discussed below.

Remittances and oil prices: India meets a large part of its crude oil demand from imports, and a rise in global oil prices is a negative shock to the economy as it leads to a widening of CAD, an increase in inflation, and a weaker rupee. As reported in the Monetary Policy Report (October 2018), 'it is estimated that for every USD 1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude, India's current account deficit could widen by USD 0.8 billion'. However, the rise in global oil prices generally positively impacts the remittances received by the country, as

India's primary source of remittances is oil-exporting countries. An analysis of quarterly data on remittances and oil prices shows that there exists a positive correlation of 75.4 per cent between the two for India.

Chart IV.24 further corroborates this correlation, as periods of rise in oil prices are associated with higher remittances.

The  plausible  mechanism  is  as  follows:  an  increase  in  oil  prices  (positive  shocks)  can generate a sizable amount of oil revenues, leading to higher investments and growth in oilproducing countries. As a result, the demand for migrant workers increases, translating into higher remittance outflows. 88  On the other hand, persistently low oil prices (adverse shocks) can  hamper  economic  activities  in  oil-exporting  economies  by  decreasing  oil  revenues. Correspondingly,  the  demand  for  migrant  workers  decreases,  which  in  turn  can  reduce remittance outflows to migrant worker countries.

Remittances and exchange rate: A higher CAD results in an increase in the demand for foreign currency and an increase in the supply of domestic currency as firms and consumers buy more imports. This applies downward pressure to the exchange rate. On the other hand, remitters get better value in rupee terms when it depreciates in terms of foreign currencies, be it for UAE's Dirham, the US Dollar, the British Pound, or any other currency.

For every one USD a worker earns in distant lands, he returns an augmented amount after necessarily being converted according to the foreign land he works in. Hence, remittances exhibited a positive association with the exchange rate movement. An analysis of quarterly

data on remittances and exchange rate shows that there exists a positive correlation of 91 per cent for India. Chart IV.25 further corroborates this correlation, as periods of exchange rate depreciation are associated with higher remittances.

Outlook: The outlook for remittance in India for 2024 is strong, with the expectation that remittance growth will moderate to 3.7 per cent, taking remittance levels to USD 124 billion in 2024. The diversification of India's migrant pool between a large share of highly skilled migrants employed mostly in high-income OECD markets, and the less-skilled migrants employed in the GCC markets is likely to lend stability to migrants' remittances in the event of external shocks. India's efforts to link its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with source countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Singapore are expected to reduce costs and speed up remittances. 89
