# Stable External Debt Position

## STABLE EXTERNAL DEBT POSITION

4.81 The current account can also be expressed as the difference between national (both public and private) savings and investment.  A current account deficit may, therefore, reflect a low level of national savings relative to the desired level of investment. External debt, by supplementing domestic savings, helps countries grow faster. In developing economies, high economic growth is typically associated with high external debt and vice-versa. However, an unsustainable large stock of external debt can potentially create vulnerabilities and dent growth prospects.

4.82 India has managed its external debt prudently with the overarching objective of keeping the  current  account  deficit  within  sustainable  limits  and  encouraging  non-debt  creation  of external finance. India's external debt has been sustainable over the years, as evident in chart IV.38 below. The external debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.7 per cent at the end of March 2024 from 19.0 per cent at the end of March 2023. The share of short-term debt (with original maturity of up to one year) in total external debt declined to 18.5 per cent at the end of March 2024 from 20.6 per cent at the end of March 2023. The ratio of FER to total debt stood at 97.4 per cent as of March 2024.

4.83 Comparing various debt vulnerability indicators of India with peer countries for 2022 indicates that India is in a better position with relatively low levels of total debt as a percentage of Gross National Income (GNI) and short-term external debt as a percentage of total external debt. The comfortable level of FER offers additional comfort.
