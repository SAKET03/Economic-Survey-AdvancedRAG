India's  external  sector  remained  strong  amidst  ongoing  geopolitical  headwinds accompanied  by  sticky  inflation.  Though  merchandise  exports  moderated  owing  to lower  demand from major trading partners, services  exports  continued  to  perform well, cushioning the overall trade deficit from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24. Lower prices of imported commodities, including crude oil, also helped.

The moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports have improved India's current account deficit (CAD). Amongst services exports, software/IT services have driven an increase in overall exports; at the same time, business services exports have also been rising,  supported  by  India  emerging  as  a  hub  for  Global  Capability Centres (GCCs).

India  is  moving  up  the  global  value  chains  (GVCs),  with  the  share  of  GVC-related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3 per cent in 2022 from 35.1 per cent in 2019. The improvement in GVC participation is also reflected in increased pure backward GVC participation. Aided by government measures on trade facilitation and reduction in logistics cost, India's rank in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023 out of 139 countries.

India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows in FY24 of USD 44.1  billion,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth,  a  stable  business  environment, and  increased  investor  confidence.  Rising  FPI  inflows  kept  the  Indian  Rupee  in  a manageable  range  of  ₹82  to  ₹83.5/USD  in  FY24.  The  Rupee  emerged  as  the  least volatile  currency  among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies in  FY24. The shock absorbers of India's external sector - forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, and market-determined exchange rate, are in place to cushion the global headwinds.

In  the  future,  the  changing  composition  of  India's  export  basket,  enhancement  in trade-related  infrastructure,  enhanced  quality  consciousness  and  product  safety considerations in the private sector and stable policy environment are expected to play a significant role in driving India's rise as a global supplier of goods and services.
