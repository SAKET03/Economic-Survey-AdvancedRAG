# Conclusion and Outlook

## CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

10.38. The  foregoing  analysis  gives  an  indication  of  the  emerging  trends  in  the  Indian industrial landscape. First, over the last decade, there has been a significant realignment of output shares among industrial segments. Sectors like chemicals, wood products and furniture, pharmaceuticals,  transport  equipment,  steel  and  machinery  and  equipment  have  gained  in strength.  Some  of  these  are  important  industrial  intermediates  and  consumer  goods,  while the others cater to requirements of capital formation. On the other hand, sectors like textiles, food products, beverages and tobacco and petroleum products and leather lost their relative positions.

10.39.  Secondly, the export-import balance of different industrial segments has vastly varied over  the  last  few  years.  Consistently,  major  net  exporters  include  industries  such  as  steel, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles. On the other hand, import dependency in key sectors like coal, capital goods and chemicals continue.

10.40. Thirdly, the medium-term outlook on the demand for capital goods and key construction inputs like steel and cement is likely to be positive, as there are clear signs that capital formation in  the  private  sector  is  gathering  momentum.  Global  uncertainties  raise  question  mark  on export demand and the domestic cost of production due to dependence on critical imported inputs like coal, petroleum, steel and machinery.

- Under the Global Innovation Index (GII), India's rank improved consistently.
- India ranks first in the lower middle-income countries and among central and southern Asian economies.
- India  holds  the  top  rank globally  in  the  domestic market scale indicator.

10.41.  Government has taken many recent initiatives to improve ease of doing business, reduce compliance burden and to alleviate logistic and infrastructural bottlenecks. The PLI schemes for key sectors have attracted significant investments, boosted production, sales and exports and generated jobs, particularly in the case of white goods. Where governments across the country can help is in reviewing, amending, relaxing and annulling regulations that are messy, stifling, counterproductive and raise the cost of operations for businesses without commensurate public benefits. Decisions that are best left to the entrepreneurs are mandated by law, leading to fear of prosecution. The path to further industrialisation in India is paved with deregulation.

10.42.  Two common requirements across industries relate to incentivising R&amp;D and innovation and improving the skill levels of the workforce. With respect to both, industry must take the lead.  Commitment  to  R&amp;D  must  be  in  the  DNA  of  the  industry,  independent  of  any  fiscal incentive, since it is about global competitiveness and profitability. With active collaboration between industry and academia and emphasis on vocational education in curriculums, India can meet the skill shortage more effectively than hitherto.

10.43.  Sectors  with  widely  scattered  production  units  like  textiles,  and  the  MSME  sector in  general,  seek  solutions  to  constraints  of  supply  chain  management,  market  access  and formalisation.  There  have  been  many  focused  policy  initiatives  addressing  these  issues,  as mentioned in the section on MSME; further action along the following lines may be considered at the levels of the appropriate governments in a cooperative federalism mode:

- (a) Ensuring support systems to develop MSME projects and their bankability and adequate financing arrangements for such projects
- (b)  targeted facilitation and incentivisation of employment-intensive MSME segments
- (c) progressively easing the compliance requirements with a single-window mechanism for clearances, digitisation of processes and equipping MSMEs to handle these processes with ease
- (d)  providing grassroots-level facilitation to ensure market access to MSME products
- (e) government-industry-academia collaboration to upskill the workforce.
- 10.44. Upgrading the statistics on industry on the following lines will aid policymaking:
- (a) Updated  index  of  industrial  production,  incorporating  the  vast  changes  that  have occurred in India's manufacturing landscape. State level variants of such indices will help understanding the emerging geographical patterns
- (b)  Regular indicators of the dynamics of production and employment in MSMEs
- (c) Information on industry-wise gross disbursement of bank credit (as opposed to the data on outstanding credit currently available), industry-wise monthly gross financial flows through domestic and external equity and debt routes as well as other financing sources.
