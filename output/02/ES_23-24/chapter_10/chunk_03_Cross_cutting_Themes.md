## CROSS-CUTTING THEMES

## Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme

10.27.  Keeping in view India's vision of becoming 'Aatmanirbhar', Production Linked Incentive (PLI)  Schemes  for  14  key  sectors  were  announced  with  an  outlay  of  ₹1.97  Lakh  Crore  to enhance India's manufacturing capabilities and exports. Over ₹1.28 Lakh Crore of investment was  reported  until  May  2024,  which  has  led  to  production/sales  of  ₹10.8  Lakh  Crore  and employment generation (direct &amp; indirect) of over 8.5 Lakh. Export boosted by ₹4 Lakh Crore, with  significant  contributions  from  sectors  such  as  large-scale  electronics  manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, and telecom &amp; networking products.

10.28. PLI Scheme for White Goods (ACs and LED Lights) with a total outlay of ₹6,238 Crore was approved by the Government. As of May, 2024 the cumulative investment achieved by white goods(AC, LEDs) under the PLI scheme was ₹3181 crore which generated cumulative sales of ₹13320 crore. The PLI scheme for the remaining sector is covered under the respective sector sections.

## Micro, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises

10.29.  As  per  the  latest  information  available  from  the  Ministry  of  Statistics  &amp;  Programme Implementation, the share of MSMEs in all-India manufacturing output during the year FY22 was 35.4 per cent. Data Dissemination Portal of Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS) states that the share of export of MSME-specified products in all-India exports in 2023-24 was 45.7 per cent.

10.30. According to the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises for 2021-22 and 2022-23, 20   the  number  of  unincorporated  enterprises  in  India  increased  with  5.9  per  cent during the period of October 2022-September 2023 in comparison to April, 2021-March 2022. During the same period, Gross Value Added (GVA) per worker increased from ₹1,38,207 to ₹1,41,769 and Gross Value of Output (GVO) per establishment increased from ₹3,98,304 to ₹4,63,389. This shows an increased productivity with more efficient use of resources including labour, which is critical for sustained economic growth and competitiveness.

10.31.  The  Udyam  Registration  portal,  launched  in  July  2020,  has  been  instrumental  in formalising MSMEs by providing a simple, online, and free registration process based on selfdeclaration. As of 05 July 2024, 4.69 Crore MSMEs are registered on the Udyam Registration portal, including Informal micro enterprises registered on the Udyam Assist Platform. Udyam registration helps MSMEs avail themselves of the benefits of the Ministry of MSME schemes. Udyam-registered  MSMEs  are  also  eligible  for  priority  sector  lending  from  banks.  Udyam Portal has API linkage with 37 other portals, and through this, data sharing is facilitated. This has benefited the MSME sector considerably.

10.32.  The Union Budget 2023-24 allocated ₹9,000 Crore to the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust

10.33. Challenges  and  Opportunities: MSMEs  face  challenges,  including  issues  with formalisation and inclusion, limited access to finance, markets, technology, and digitalisation, infrastructural  bottlenecks,  and  skilling.  To  address  these  challenges,  the  Government  has implemented initiatives and platforms aimed at supporting formalisation, ease of registration and  grievance  redressal,  like  the  Samadhaan  Portal,  Sambandh  Portal,  and  Champions Portal, which aid in delayed payment issues, procurement monitoring, and speedy resolution

of grievances. The Global Value Chain Development Report (2019) highlights that although SMEs are underrepresented in global value chains, the digital economy offers them significant new opportunities. This is evident in India's MSME sector, where nearly 70 per cent of total e-commerce sales in 2020-21 were from MSMEs, reflecting a year-on-year growth rate of 6070 per cent 21 . Further, research shows that reimagining the level of regulations on the usage of factory space, like those relating to setbacks, will likely augment the manufacturing capacity, especially of the micro and small firms (Box X.9).

## Box X.9: Reimagining building regulations to augment manufacturing capacity

Existing industrial building regulations limit factory land usage, reducing land utility and resulting in unquantified costs. The report titled State of Regulation: Building Standards Reforms for Jobs and Growth 22  illustrates how land remains unutilised while complying with the four building regulations relating to ground coverage, setbacks, parking and floor area ratio.

1. Land  lost  due  to  Ground  Coverage: The  report  shows  that  under  the  ground coverage  regulations  on  factory  plots,  intended  to  control  density  and  promote groundwater  recharge,  a  factory  building  can  cover  no  more  than  40-60  per  cent of  the  plot,  depending  on  the  State  in  which  the  factory  conducts  its  operations.  In comparison, in Hong Kong, a factory will not lose any proportion of the plot; in the Philippines, only 30 per cent of the plot.
2. Land  lost  due  to  Setbacks: State-level  regulations  limit  the  horizontal  building expansion to minimise fire risk and ensure ventilation and light. The aforementioned report shows that regulations, however, do not account for modernisation in technology and  manufacturing  processes.  For  example,  the  use  of  fire-resistant  materials  and automatic fire-fighting equipment can effectively reduce hazards without locking up productive  land.  Moreover,  natural  light  and  ventilation  may  be  counterproductive in  certain  industries  like  chemicals,  pharmaceuticals,  and  electronics.  Setbacks  are particularly challenging for micro and small factories in certain States. The factories end up losing even 60-90 per cent of their land in certain States just to comply with these regulations. A mega factory in an Indian State loses ~2X more land to setbacks than one in the Philippines and ~5X more than the one in Singapore.
3. Land  lost  due  to  Parking  Regulations: State  governments  enforce  regulations mandating  off-street  parking  to  ease  street  congestion.  However,  research  suggests that these mandates may actually contribute to more congestion. Parking requirements do not align with actual demand, leading factories to lose a significant amount of land. The report finds that the factories across India lose ~12-70 per cent of their land to

22    Bhuvana, A., Kaur, S., and Roy, S., 2023. 'State of Regulation: Building standards reforms for jobs and growth'. Prosperiti, December

meet parking minimums. A factory in India may have to provide at least double the number of car parking spaces compared to Hong Kong, the Philippines, or Singapore.

4. Land lost due to Floor Ratio: States regulate the floor area ratio (FAR) to restrict vertical  expansion  on  designated  land  parcels,  aiming  to  manage  density,  alleviate traffic congestion, and facilitate the provision of essential utilities such as water and electricity. However, such regulations may inadvertently contribute to urban sprawl, thereby exacerbating road congestion and escalating utility provisioning expenses. On average, factories across states are only allowed to create floor space up to 1.3 times the plot size. With a 1000 sqm plot, an office building in Mumbai can be built up to 5000 sqm, whereas in Japan, it can go up to 13,000 sqm and 15,000 sqm in Singapore and Hong Kong.

There is a need to examine and rationalise building regulations to augment manufacturing capacity.  Better  utilisation  of  land  will  bring  the  fixed  cost  of  production  per  unit, thus  incentivising  the  entrepreneur  to  hire  more  workers  as  well.  Apart  from  studying international best practices, inter-state comparisons can help states identify best practices and adopt appropriate policies.

## Box X.10: ODOP: Crafting regional pride and economic empowerment

In 2018, the Government launched the One District One Product (ODOP) initiative to identify, brand, and promote the unique strengths of each district through a single, iconic product produced in that district to bridge the regional economic divide and nurture self-reliance across India's diverse districts. Districts that have more than one product identified have been categorised as secondary or tertiary products. These products cover various sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, handloom and textiles, handicrafts, food processing, marine, and services. The initiative has identified 1102 products from 761 districts across the country till now.

To give an impetus to the ODOP initiative, the Union Budget of FY24 announced that States would be encouraged to set up a 'Unity Mall' in their state capital or most prominent tourism centre or the financial capital for the promotion and sale of their own ODOPs, GI products and other handicraft products, and for providing space for such products of all other states. These 'PM-Ekta Malls' aim to link the artisans of ODOP and consumers. These malls are creating a vibrant marketplace for the nation's unique products, aiming at both domestic and foreign markets.

The Government has been undertaking many initiatives to promote ODOP and showcase success  stories.  'ODOP  Sampark'  workshops  were  conducted  in  15  States  to  facilitate collaboration between the Centre and local sellers and revive indigenous industries. ODOP showcased India to the world at the various G20 events organised across the country during India's G20 Presidency, where the artisans, sellers and weavers got much visibility on the global stage during the events. 23

## Some of the success stories of ODOP

- Pack  sheds  and  irrigation  arteries,  funded  by  various  Government  initiatives,  have resulted in a 20 per cent surge in the production of Shopian apples in Kashmir.
- NGOs, local administration, and over 700 farmers in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand have been empowered with organic farming skills through 15 tailored training sessions. Equipped with vital tools  for  1000+  beneficiaries,  red  rice  production  in  this  district increased considerably.
- Nearly 1,50,000 tribal families in Araku Valley, Andhra Pradesh, have boosted coffee output by 20 per cent, fuelled by Girijan Co-Operative Corporation loans.
- Over 5,000 trained workers in the Kandhamal district of Odisha have joined 1,300 farmers in garnering domestic and international turmeric markets. Government procurement of the spice has also increased by about 70 per cent. Speedy testing labs, financial aid in the form of subsidies, loans, and support for formalisation in the Bhatinda district of Punjab have led to a 30 per cent rise in honey production. 24

## Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs)

10.34.  As of March 31, 2023, 254 CPSEs were operational. Around 66 per cent of the CPSEs operated in the service sector; the rest in manufacturing, processing &amp; generation and mining &amp; exploration. CPSEs achieved stronger financial parameters FY23 and FY24. The total Market Capitalisation (M-cap) of 63 CPSEs traded on stock exchanges of India was ₹16.69 Lakh Crore as of March 31, 2023, as against ₹15.46 Lakh Crore as of March 31, 2022, reflecting an increase of 7.95 per cent 25 . The overall net profit of operating CPSEs in FY23 was ₹2.12 Lakh Crore. The major financial parameters of CPSEs are presented in the Charts below.

## Industrial Credit

10.35.  Industrial credit growth depends on a host of factors, including the cyclicality of economic activity,  relativity  in  the  availability  and  cost  of  bank  funds  and  other  market  options,  the position of own resources of industrial enterprises and the banking system's own risk appetite. Recovering from the pandemic-driven moderation in FY21, industrial credit picked up strongly in the next year. In FY23, credit growth was mainly driven by large industries; however, this growth was hampered by a decrease in credit to certain sectors.

## Industrial R&amp;D and Innovation

10.36.  As the public sector presence in core manufacturing is limited to only about 7 per cent, its  share in industrial R&amp;D is also limited. An initial review of the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2023 indicator shows that the U.S. is leading in corporate R&amp;D, followed by China and Germany. Middle-income countries like India, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia also experienced an increase in their R&amp;D 26 . As industrial R&amp;D in India is highly concentrated in a few sectors, the top five sectors account for more than 70 per cent.
