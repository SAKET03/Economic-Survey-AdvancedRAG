## Cement: Building the future

10.6 The  cement  industry  contributes  approximately  11  per  cent  of  the  input  cost  to  the construction sector in India. 4  Since de-licensing in 1991, the cement industry has progressed significantly both in capacity and process technology, so much so that India is the second largest cement producer in the world after China. 5

10.7 The Indian cement industry comprises 159 integrated large cement plants, 120 grinding units and 62 mini cement plants. The current annual installed capacity of the cement industry in India is about 622 million tonnes, with cement production of around 427 million tonnes in FY24. Most of the cement plants in India are located in proximity to the raw material source. About 85 per cent of the cement industry is concentrated in the States of Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal.

10.8 The industry has adequate capacity to meet the domestic cement demand; the quantity of cement imported in the year FY23 is about 0.2 per cent of total domestic cement production. The export of clinker and other cement increased until FY19 and then started declining except for other hydraulic cement on account of lower global demand and increasing competition from other countries. In FY23, India exported only a negligible quantity of clinker.

10.9 The industry has maintained a capacity utilisation rate of approximately 60-65 per cent in recent years. Reports also expect that the global demand for cement is likely to be flat during 2024-2030, with bright spots in demand emanating only from India, Africa, the Middle East and North America to an extent. Yet gross margins in the cement industry are likely to be robust globally, helped by higher prices and lower fuel costs. 6

10.10 Domestic cement consumption in India is around 260 kg per capita against a global average of 540 kg per capita, signifying potential for growth.  In the last ten years, the import of clinker has increased. However, the quantity of imports is still low.

10.11 The  cement  industry  is  mainly  driven  by  robust  infrastructure  development  and urbanisation.  The  government's  focus  on  mega  infrastructure  projects  such  as  highways, railways, housing schemes and smart cities will boost cement demand significantly. The push for  rural  development  and  increased  investment  in  industrial  and  commercial  construction support growth prospects.

10.12 Globally,  the  cement  sector  generates  about  7  per  cent  of  the  total  anthropogenic emissions.  The  Indian  cement  industry  has  been  working  on  the  issue.  Greenhouse  gas emissions are estimated to have been reduced to 0.56 t CO2 per tonne of cement in 2023. CO2 emissions are targeted to be further reduced to 0.35 t CO2 per tonne of cement by 2050, as estimated in the cement industry technology roadmap. 7

## Steel sector on the growth path

10.13 Iron  and  steel  contribute  approximately  47  per  cent  of  all  inputs  in  the  building  &amp; construction  sector. 8 It  also  serves  as  a  critical  input  for  the  production  of  machinery  and consumer goods. The steel sector achieved its highest levels of production and consumption during FY24.

10.14 India became a net exporter of finished steel over the past decade. In FY24, India started off as a net exporter in Q1. However, in Q2 and Q3, it became a net importer. This was largely driven by price differentials between international and domestic prices of finished steel. Low prices in the international market led to reduced profit margins for exports and made imports more  affordable,  affecting  the  trade  balance  in  steel.  However,  the  import  dependence  on coking coal, an essential raw material for steel production went up from 56.1 MT in FY23 to 58.1 MT in FY24.

10.15 As the world moves towards a low-carbon economy, green steel is poised to play a pivotal role in reshaping the future of the steel industry. India's steel sector accounts for 12 per cent 9 of India's greenhouse gas emissions with an emission intensity of 2.5 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of crude steel compared to the global average of 1.9 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of crude steel.

## Box X.1: Steel sector initiatives

To  achieve  the  goal  of  a  self-reliant  India  and  boost  the  steel  sector,  the  Government established the Nagarnar Steel plant in Bastar district in October 2023, marking a significant milestone  in  India's  steel  production  capabilities.  The  greenfield  project  is  expected  to produce high-quality steel, contributing to the socio-economic development of the region and positioning India as a key player in the global steel market. The plant is designed to produce a range of flat steel products. In FY24, the plant produced 4.93 Lakh tonnes of hotrolled coils. Among the steel CPSEs, Steel Authority of India Limited achieved its best-ever production of hot metal, crude steel, and saleable steel in FY24.

The PLI Scheme for speciality steel, approved in 2021, has attracted investment of ₹15,519 Crore till May 24. On 17.03.2023, Ministry of Steel signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the 27 selected companies having 57 applications. This scheme will attract total investment commitment of ₹29,531 Crore with capacity addition of 24,780 thousand tonnes.

## Coal: Reducing external dependence

10.16 Coal accounts for more than 55 per cent of India's primary commercial energy. Coalfired  power  generation  accounts  for  about  70  per  cent  of  the  total  power  generation.  Coal production accelerated in the last five years, leading to reduced import dependence. In FY24, India produced 997.2 million tonnes of coal, imported 261 MT and consumed 1233.86 MT 10 . The  ratio  of  domestic  production  of  coal  to  consumption  improved  gradually  over  the  last decade as the growth in production outstripped the growth in consumption.

| • The government has set a target to gasify 100 MT of coal by 2030 to reduce imports. • A scheme with an outlay of ₹8500 Crore during 2023-24 to provide viability gap funding to coal/lignite gasification projects has been launched. • Launched Integrated Coal Logistics Policy and Plan in February 2024 to develop technologically enabled, integrated and cost-effective logistics for coal evacuation. • Notified the amended Coal Blocks Allocation Rules, 2017, in May 2023. • Coal India Limited (CIL) is venturing to set up 3,000 MW of renewable power capacity for power mining operations by 2025-26. During 2023-24, a total of 8.60 million units were generated from solar installations till December 2023. • CIL is gradually moving to a high- capacity coal evacuation system, making it moreefficient andefficient byinstalling coal handling plants/silos under its 'First Mile Connectivity' projects. • CIL is pursuing the acquisition of critical mineral assets like lithium and cobalt in India and abroad. | • Technological difficulties due to the limited availability of modern mining equipment from Indigenous manufacturers • Procedural complexities in acquiring forestry and environmental clearances, land acquisition, and possession need to be taken care of for the timely development of mining projects. • Need for sustainable solutions amid global environmental action. • To mitigate challenges, the industry is focusing on reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency, and adopting cleaner coal technologies. • In spite of an adequate domestic supply of thermal coal, only the substitutable part of the import can be replaced. Increasing demand for coking coal will push coking coal imports up. Coking coal beneficiation needs to be scaled up for blending with imported coal under the 'coking coal mission'. • Coalcanbeusedasagreenenergysource, such as coal mine methane (CMM), coal bed methane (CBM), coal to liquid, and coal to methanol. The CMM and CBM need to be tapped progressively. | • Technological difficulties due to the limited availability of modern mining equipment from Indigenous manufacturers • Procedural complexities in acquiring forestry and environmental clearances, land acquisition, and possession need to be taken care of for the timely development of mining projects. • Need for sustainable solutions amid global environmental action. • To mitigate challenges, the industry is focusing on reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency, and adopting cleaner coal technologies. • In spite of an adequate domestic supply of thermal coal, only the substitutable part of the import can be replaced.

## Major Consumer-oriented Industries

## Pharmaceuticals: Growing and Global Presence

10.17.  India's pharmaceutical market currently valued at USD 50 Billion is the world's thirdlargest by volume. With a diversified product base covering generic drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients, bulk drugs, over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, biologics and biosimilars, the Indian

pharmaceutical industry has a strong presence at the global level. 'Pharmacy of the world' as  it  is  often  called  offers  around  60,000  generic  brands  across  60  therapeutic  categories, accounting for 20 per cent of global generic drug exports by volume. Not surprisingly, eight of the top 20 global generic companies are based in India.

10.18.  India's pharmaceutical sector boasts high rates of quality compliance, with 703 11 US  FDAapproved facilities (as of April 2023), 386 12  European GMP-compliant plants (as of November 2022) and 2418 13  WHO-GMP-approved plants. To further bolster the regulatory framework, in December 2023, revised pharma manufacturing rules were notified under Schedule-M relating to Good Manufacturing Practices, a mandatory requirement that safeguards quality and brings the existing regime in line with global standards. 14

10.19.  India's pharmaceutical industry has traditionally been dependent on API imports from one country. The PLI schemes for bulk drugs and pharmaceuticals have helped stabilize the import of bulk drugs and improved our supply chain resilience. Under the scheme, fermentationbased manufacturing capabilities got strengthened through production of antibiotics such as Penicillin G and Clavulanic Acid. The CAGR of import of bulk drugs between FY22 and FY24 was 2.3 per cent, as compared to the CAGR of 5.9 per cent in their export. India has become a net exporter of bulk drugs. During FY24, the value of export and import of bulk drugs was ₹39,632 Crore and ₹37,722 Crore respectively.

## Box X.4: Need to Enhance and Reimagine Pharma R&amp;D

The  pharmaceutical  industry  worldwide  can  be  divided  into  an  innovator  or  a  generic producer.  As  the  name  suggests,  'innovator'  firms  carry  out  extensive  research  to  bring new medicines or treatments for diseases to the world. Considering the extent of time and resources as also the risk involved in the process, the prices of such medicines are usually very high. Such firms thrive on monopolies created through intellectual property rights owned by them for these new medicines. In recent years, big innovator pharma companies have made a strategic move to invest in smaller, more agile research-oriented firms. Between 2021 and 2023, the investment amounted to USD 54 billion in small bio-tech firms. 16

India's  strength  in  the  pharmaceutical  sector  lies  in  being  a  cost  effective  and  efficient producer of existing off patented drugs- also called the generic industry. Even so research and  development  is  key  to  producing  the  same  medicines  once  they  get  off  patent  at  a fraction of the cost of the original drug. They thrive on competition. The world needs both the innovators and those that can provide drugs at a reasonable price, with the latter playing a vital role in enhancing social benefits. Hence, the strength of the industry lies in having a diverse combination of innovators and generic producers.

As we move towards realising the vision of Viksit Bharat, it is vital to promote innovation. The R&amp;D expenditure in the drugs and pharmaceutical sector in India averaged around 5 per cent of the sales turnover in FY20 and FY21 17 . The development of new drugs aimed at addressing unaddressed health concerns will improve the breadth and quality of healthcare access for the population, while producing better returns on investments.

The report 'Indian pharmaceutical sectorial system of innovation' 18  underscores the need for:

- i) fostering joint research amongst industry actors with the aim of making the sector more strategically collaborative rather than competitive.
2. ii) bolstering  industry-academic  interactions  for  applied  research,  in  particular  better participation of public knowledge-based institutions.
3. iii)  reducing  the  rigidity  of  communication  between  knowledge-based  institutions  in order to foster better knowledge exchange and collaboration in the areas of research, particularly with the inclusion of Tier 2 and Tier 3 institutions.
4. iv) supporting  secondments and placements between knowledge-based institutions and industry in order to better orient human capital development.
- v) strengthening communication channels amongst the knowledge-based institutions and intermediaries, particularly industry associations.
6. vi) increasing the channels of funding from venture capital and angel investors to support the process of ideation to market.

- vii)  better knowledge sharing amongst government bodies to promote an 'all of government approach'  to  innovation  thus  translating  into  more  coordinated  joint  research  in strategic areas.

The  government  has  taken  several  measures  to  create  and  nurture  an  ecosystem  that promotes innovation. This is reflected in the setting up of centres for excellence to promote collaborative research in the pharmaceutical sector, and in artificial intelligence including for  the  health  sector.  The  recently  introduced  Promotion  of  Research  and  Innovation  in Pharma MedTech Sector is expected to herald a transformation in the pharmaceutical sector towards innovation.

## Textile industry: Navigating challenges

10.21.  As per the National Accounts published by the Central Statistics Office, textiles, including the wearing apparel sector, generated a gross value added of ₹3.77 lakh Crore in FY23, which was about 10.6 per cent of the manufacturing GVA at current prices during the year. The sector also accounted for 29.3 per cent of the total non-corporate manufacturing GVA and 7.9 per cent of the corporate manufacturing GVA in FY23.

10.22.  India has a robust end-to-end value chain in the textile industry, spanning raw materials like  natural  and  MMF  fibre  to  the  final  product  and  covering  apparel,  home  textiles,  and technical  textiles.  India  is  the  world's  second-largest  clothing  manufacturer  and  one  of  the top five exporting nations. In FY24, the export of textiles and apparel, including handicrafts, increased by 1 per cent, reaching ₹2.97 lakh Crore. The sector is diversified, with readymade garments  accounting  for  the  largest  share  (41  per  cent)  in  the  total  exports  in  FY24,  with exports of ₹1.2 lakh Crore, followed by cotton textiles (34 per cent) and man-made textiles (14 per cent).

## Box X.5: Challenges and supportive initiatives in the textile industry

## Industry context and challenges

## Supportive initiatives

- The majority of India's textile and apparel production  capacity  is  on  account  of MSMEs, which account for over 80 per cent of the sector, and the average scale of  operations  is  relatively  small.  Thus, efficiency  and  economies  of  scale  from large-scale  modern  manufacturing  are limited.
- The fragmented nature of India's apparel sector, with raw materials sourced predominantly from Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, while spinning  capacities  are  concentrated  in southern  states,  contributes  to  higher transportation costs and delays.
- Other factors, such as India's heavy dependence on imported machinery, except in the spinning segment, inadequate availability of skilled manpower,  technological  obsolescence, etc, also act as significant constraints.
- NITI Aayog's recommendations for the  sector  include  supporting  domestic machine manufacturers through initiatives such as ATUFS, fostering R&amp;D, and promoting innovation.
- Priorities  also  include  creating  worldclass textile  infrastructure  with  plugand-play facilities. The focus will also  be  on  technological  upgradation, sustainability and circularity, quality and standards  and  promotion  of  handloom and handicraft products.
- Seven PM MITRA Parks, with a budget of ₹4,445 Crore, will be established from FY22 to FY28 in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Gujarat,  Karnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra.
- The parks will feature 1,000-acre industrial  infrastructure  and  "plug  and play" facilities.
- MoUs were signed with all seven states, with  JVs  and  SPVs  established  in  five states.
- The Government approved a PLI Scheme with  ₹10,683 Crores over five years for man-made fibre apparel and fabrics and technical textiles. It is expected to attract over  ₹19,000  Crore  in  investment  and create 2.5 Lakh jobs.
- Launched with an outlay of ₹1,480 Crore for FY21 to FY24, the National Technical Textiles  Mission  focuses  on  increasing the  use  of  technical  textiles  in  various sectors.
- It has four components: research innovation  &amp;  development,  promotion and market development, education, training and skilling, and export promotion. It has been extended to March 2026, with a sunset clause until March 2028.
- 137 research projects for ₹474 Crore have been approved so far.
- The  National  Handloom  Development Programme (NHDP) approved for FY22 to FY26 with an outlay of ₹998 Crore.
- In  FY24,  initiatives  were  undertaken  to establish  96  small  handloom  clusters. Nine mega handloom clusters have also been set up.

## Electronics industry: Powering the future

10.23.  India's electronics manufacturing sector has experienced significant growth since 2014, accounting for an estimated 3.7 per cent of the global market share in FY22. At the same time, the industry contributed 4 per cent to India's total GDP in FY22. Domestic production of electronic items  increased  significantly  to  ₹8.22  lakh  Crore,  while  exports  rose  to  ₹1.9  lakh  Crore  in FY23. India has become an attractive destination for investments in this sector, and substantial manufacturing capacities have been established in the country over the past five years. Many major brands, both foreign and domestic, have either established their own manufacturing facilities or have outsourced manufacturing to Electronics Manufacturing Services companies operating in India.

<!-- image -->

10.24.  Research by the Centre for Development Studies 19  shows that India has seen a significant increase  in  domestic  value  addition  (DVA),  employment,  wages  and  salaries  in  mobile manufacturing segment since FY17. The share of DVA in mobile phone output rose from an average of 8.7 per cent in FY17 to FY19 (Phase 1) to 22 per cent in FY20 to FY22 (Phase 2), indicating considerable increase in local participation. While the DVA as a ratio of exports may be low, participating in global value chains (GVC) increases in overall value added because of  economies of scale in manufacturing for the vast global market. The direct workforce in the production of mobile phones has more than tripled between FY17 to FY22, particularly benefiting female blue-collar workers. Wages and salaries increased by 317 per cent between phase 1 and phase 2. The study suggests that reducing service link costs is crucial for seamless participation  in  GVC,  necessitating  efforts  to  lower  transaction  costs.  This  recommends  a comprehensive  policy  approach,  including  low  import  tariffs  for  intermediate  inputs,  to replicate success in other sectors.

## Automotive industry

10.25.  The  Indian  automobile  industry  includes  major  global  auto  manufacturers  across different categories, as well as a vibrant auto component industry that produces various auto parts, body and chassis. The growth in the value of domestic production and consumption of automotive parts moderated during FY20 to FY23, compared to the previous five years. The production of auto components depends on the dynamics of the domestic and export markets. The  auto  components  sector  closely  follows  the  trends  in  automobile  production.  As  seen below, the pandemic affected the automobile sector considerably, which weakened the demand for automotive parts and, hence, their pace of expansion.

<!-- image -->

10.26.  In the first half of the last decade, passenger vehicles, such as cars and utility vehicles, experienced  significant  growth.  However,  the  pandemic  had  a  substantial  impact  on  all segments of the automotive industry. While passenger vehicles quickly recovered, the recovery period for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and commercial vehicles is longer. Chart X.17 indicates that cars and utility vehicles (UVs), three wheelers, two wheelers and commercial vehicles are currently expanding as seen in the growth rates of recent years. In FY24, the country produced approximately 49 lakh passenger vehicles, 9.9 lakh three-wheelers, 214.7 lakh two-wheelers, and 10.7 lakh commercial vehicles.
