## INDUSTRY: SMALL AND

## MEDIUM MATTERS

<!-- image -->

Industrial growth accelerated in FY24, with manufacturing and construction leading the way. Industrial GVA at constant prices in FY24 was 25 per cent higher than the pre-Covid  FY20  levels,  affirming  broad-based  recovery  and  consolidation.  This was supported  by  greater  credit  offtake,  a  thrust  on  capital  formation  to  shore  up infrastructure-oriented sectors, and a supportive policy framework.

In the last decade, there were considerable changes in the sectoral composition of India's manufacturing landscape. Some consumer-oriented industries like automobiles, wood products, furniture and pharmaceuticals have made large gains in output share and production-oriented  sectors  like  machinery,  chemicals,  non-metallic  minerals,  and rubber and plastic products have also had share gains, balancing the growth dynamics. At a same time, sectors like petroleum products, textiles, beverage and tobacco have witnessed gradual decline in their output share.

Going forward, invigorating ongoing efforts to impart greater efficiencies, skills, and dynamics  to  labour-intensive  segments  like  textiles,  food  processing,  and  MSMEs would  lend  greater  balance  to  industrial  expansion.  Incentivising  R&amp;D  investment, greater formalisation  of smaller  manufacturers,  alleviating  their  supply  chain bottlenecks,  facilitating  market  access  and  improving  access  to  finance  will  also foster industrialisation. Further reduction in the compliance burden for MSMEs will considerably improve their growth prospects.

Domestic demand conditions on account of consumption and investment are strong and conducive to smooth industrial  output  expansion  in  the  near  term.  A  forwardlooking survey of the Reserve Bank of India on business expectations and industrial outlook presents a positive outlook. However, headwinds persist in terms of uncertain global demand conditions and prices of key inputs for which India is import-dependent.

## INTRODUCTION

10.1 Economic growth of 8.2 per cent in FY24 was supported by an industrial growth of 9.5  per  cent. 1   Among  the  four  sub-sectors  of  industry,  manufacturing  and  construction achieved close to double-digit growth, while mining &amp; quarrying and electricity &amp; water supply also  recorded  strong  positive  growth  in  FY24.  This  reflects  the  broad-based  acceleration  of

This is greater than the 9 per cent industrial growth estimated in the second advance estimates of GDP released in February 2024, indicating faster than anticipated expansion of industrial output during the latter part of FY24.

industrial output. The HSBC India Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing also consistently remained well above the threshold value of 50 in all months of FY24, indicating sustained expansion and stability in India's manufacturing sector.

10.2 The share of manufacturing in total gross value added at current prices was 14.3 per cent in FY23.  However, the output share is 35.2 per cent during the same period, indicating that the sector has significant backward and forward linkages that are not fully captured within its value-added share. About 47.5 per cent of the total value of output in the country is used as inputs in productive activities (inter-industry consumption) 2 . Manufacturing activities account for about 50 per cent of the inter-industry consumption and, at the same time, supply almost 50 per cent of inputs used in all productive activities (agriculture, industry and services).

10.3 Despite the pandemic and consequent impairment of manufacturing value chains, the manufacturing sector achieved an average annual growth rate of 5.2 per cent in the last decade. The manufacturing sub-sectors witnessed considerable realignment in output shares in the last decade. Catalysts of manufacturing growth in the last decade included chemicals, wood products and furniture, transport equipment, pharmaceuticals and machinery and equipment. Out of them, the expansion of steel, machinery and equipment, wood products, and transport equipment signifies a thrust on capital formation in the economy, especially in the public sector.

10.4 India's industrialisation was held in check by the absence of physical infrastructure and logistics as well as intrusive and cumbersome licensing requirements on capacity creation and expansion. Further, the manufacture of specific items was reserved for the small-scale sector. Much of these restrictions have been now lifted, and physical infrastructure is being created at a rapid pace. Connectivity has improved. The Goods and Services Tax has created a single market for several commodities, enabling manufacturing at scale. However, India faces stiff challenges in growing its manufacturing base. Public policy must do whatever it can to boost competitiveness.  Action  lies  predominantly  in  deregulation.  The  private  sector  must  think long-term and invest in quality through R&amp;D spending. These may not be sufficient, but they are  necessary conditions for the growth of the sector. Manufacturing still has the ability to generate low and semi-skilled jobs and bring development closer to the people. India needs to prioritise the sector.

10.5 The remaining sections of the Chapter are organised in the following way. The next section examines progress, challenges and policy initiatives in different industrial segments, such as key industrial intermediates and consumer-oriented industries 3 . This is followed by a brief discussion on cross-cutting themes like production-linked incentives (PLIs), micro, small

## PERFORMANCE OF KEY SECTORS AND RELATED ISSUES

## Key Industrial Intermediates

## Cement: Building the future

10.6 The  cement  industry  contributes  approximately  11  per  cent  of  the  input  cost  to  the construction sector in India. 4  Since de-licensing in 1991, the cement industry has progressed significantly both in capacity and process technology, so much so that India is the second largest cement producer in the world after China. 5

10.7 The Indian cement industry comprises 159 integrated large cement plants, 120 grinding units and 62 mini cement plants. The current annual installed capacity of the cement industry in India is about 622 million tonnes, with cement production of around 427 million tonnes in FY24. Most of the cement plants in India are located in proximity to the raw material source. About 85 per cent of the cement industry is concentrated in the States of Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and West Bengal.

10.8 The industry has adequate capacity to meet the domestic cement demand; the quantity of cement imported in the year FY23 is about 0.2 per cent of total domestic cement production. The export of clinker and other cement increased until FY19 and then started declining except for other hydraulic cement on account of lower global demand and increasing competition from other countries. In FY23, India exported only a negligible quantity of clinker.

10.9 The industry has maintained a capacity utilisation rate of approximately 60-65 per cent in recent years. Reports also expect that the global demand for cement is likely to be flat during 2024-2030, with bright spots in demand emanating only from India, Africa, the Middle East and North America to an extent. Yet gross margins in the cement industry are likely to be robust globally, helped by higher prices and lower fuel costs. 6

10.10 Domestic cement consumption in India is around 260 kg per capita against a global average of 540 kg per capita, signifying potential for growth.  In the last ten years, the import of clinker has increased. However, the quantity of imports is still low.

10.11 The  cement  industry  is  mainly  driven  by  robust  infrastructure  development  and urbanisation.  The  government's  focus  on  mega  infrastructure  projects  such  as  highways, railways, housing schemes and smart cities will boost cement demand significantly. The push for  rural  development  and  increased  investment  in  industrial  and  commercial  construction support growth prospects.

10.12 Globally,  the  cement  sector  generates  about  7  per  cent  of  the  total  anthropogenic emissions.  The  Indian  cement  industry  has  been  working  on  the  issue.  Greenhouse  gas emissions are estimated to have been reduced to 0.56 t CO2 per tonne of cement in 2023. CO2 emissions are targeted to be further reduced to 0.35 t CO2 per tonne of cement by 2050, as estimated in the cement industry technology roadmap. 7

## Steel sector on the growth path

10.13 Iron  and  steel  contribute  approximately  47  per  cent  of  all  inputs  in  the  building  &amp; construction  sector. 8 It  also  serves  as  a  critical  input  for  the  production  of  machinery  and consumer goods. The steel sector achieved its highest levels of production and consumption during FY24.

10.14 India became a net exporter of finished steel over the past decade. In FY24, India started off as a net exporter in Q1. However, in Q2 and Q3, it became a net importer. This was largely driven by price differentials between international and domestic prices of finished steel. Low prices in the international market led to reduced profit margins for exports and made imports more  affordable,  affecting  the  trade  balance  in  steel.  However,  the  import  dependence  on coking coal, an essential raw material for steel production went up from 56.1 MT in FY23 to 58.1 MT in FY24.

10.15 As the world moves towards a low-carbon economy, green steel is poised to play a pivotal role in reshaping the future of the steel industry. India's steel sector accounts for 12 per cent 9 of India's greenhouse gas emissions with an emission intensity of 2.5 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of crude steel compared to the global average of 1.9 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of crude steel.

## Box X.1: Steel sector initiatives

To  achieve  the  goal  of  a  self-reliant  India  and  boost  the  steel  sector,  the  Government established the Nagarnar Steel plant in Bastar district in October 2023, marking a significant milestone  in  India's  steel  production  capabilities.  The  greenfield  project  is  expected  to produce high-quality steel, contributing to the socio-economic development of the region and positioning India as a key player in the global steel market. The plant is designed to produce a range of flat steel products. In FY24, the plant produced 4.93 Lakh tonnes of hotrolled coils. Among the steel CPSEs, Steel Authority of India Limited achieved its best-ever production of hot metal, crude steel, and saleable steel in FY24.

The PLI Scheme for speciality steel, approved in 2021, has attracted investment of ₹15,519 Crore till May 24. On 17.03.2023, Ministry of Steel signed Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the 27 selected companies having 57 applications. This scheme will attract total investment commitment of ₹29,531 Crore with capacity addition of 24,780 thousand tonnes.

## Coal: Reducing external dependence

10.16 Coal accounts for more than 55 per cent of India's primary commercial energy. Coalfired  power  generation  accounts  for  about  70  per  cent  of  the  total  power  generation.  Coal production accelerated in the last five years, leading to reduced import dependence. In FY24, India produced 997.2 million tonnes of coal, imported 261 MT and consumed 1233.86 MT 10 . The  ratio  of  domestic  production  of  coal  to  consumption  improved  gradually  over  the  last decade as the growth in production outstripped the growth in consumption.

| • The government has set a target to gasify 100 MT of coal by 2030 to reduce imports. • A scheme with an outlay of ₹8500 Crore during 2023-24 to provide viability gap funding to coal/lignite gasification projects has been launched. • Launched Integrated Coal Logistics Policy and Plan in February 2024 to develop technologically enabled, integrated and cost-effective logistics for coal evacuation. • Notified the amended Coal Blocks Allocation Rules, 2017, in May 2023. • Coal India Limited (CIL) is venturing to set up 3,000 MW of renewable power capacity for power mining operations by 2025-26. During 2023-24, a total of 8.60 million units were generated from solar installations till December 2023. • CIL is gradually moving to a high- capacity coal evacuation system, making it moreefficient andefficient byinstalling coal handling plants/silos under its 'First Mile Connectivity' projects. • CIL is pursuing the acquisition of critical mineral assets like lithium and cobalt in India and abroad. | • Technological difficulties due to the limited availability of modern mining equipment from Indigenous manufacturers • Procedural complexities in acquiring forestry and environmental clearances, land acquisition, and possession need to be taken care of for the timely development of mining projects. • Need for sustainable solutions amid global environmental action. • To mitigate challenges, the industry is focusing on reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency, and adopting cleaner coal technologies. • In spite of an adequate domestic supply of thermal coal, only the substitutable part of the import can be replaced. Increasing demand for coking coal will push coking coal imports up. Coking coal beneficiation needs to be scaled up for blending with imported coal under the 'coking coal mission'. • Coalcanbeusedasagreenenergysource, such as coal mine methane (CMM), coal bed methane (CBM), coal to liquid, and coal to methanol. The CMM and CBM need to be tapped progressively. | • Technological difficulties due to the limited availability of modern mining equipment from Indigenous manufacturers • Procedural complexities in acquiring forestry and environmental clearances, land acquisition, and possession need to be taken care of for the timely development of mining projects. • Need for sustainable solutions amid global environmental action. • To mitigate challenges, the industry is focusing on reducing emissions, improving energy efficiency, and adopting cleaner coal technologies. • In spite of an adequate domestic supply of thermal coal, only the substitutable part of the import can be replaced.

## Major Consumer-oriented Industries

## Pharmaceuticals: Growing and Global Presence

10.17.  India's pharmaceutical market currently valued at USD 50 Billion is the world's thirdlargest by volume. With a diversified product base covering generic drugs, active pharmaceutical ingredients, bulk drugs, over-the-counter drugs, vaccines, biologics and biosimilars, the Indian

pharmaceutical industry has a strong presence at the global level. 'Pharmacy of the world' as  it  is  often  called  offers  around  60,000  generic  brands  across  60  therapeutic  categories, accounting for 20 per cent of global generic drug exports by volume. Not surprisingly, eight of the top 20 global generic companies are based in India.

10.18.  India's pharmaceutical sector boasts high rates of quality compliance, with 703 11 US  FDAapproved facilities (as of April 2023), 386 12  European GMP-compliant plants (as of November 2022) and 2418 13  WHO-GMP-approved plants. To further bolster the regulatory framework, in December 2023, revised pharma manufacturing rules were notified under Schedule-M relating to Good Manufacturing Practices, a mandatory requirement that safeguards quality and brings the existing regime in line with global standards. 14

10.19.  India's pharmaceutical industry has traditionally been dependent on API imports from one country. The PLI schemes for bulk drugs and pharmaceuticals have helped stabilize the import of bulk drugs and improved our supply chain resilience. Under the scheme, fermentationbased manufacturing capabilities got strengthened through production of antibiotics such as Penicillin G and Clavulanic Acid. The CAGR of import of bulk drugs between FY22 and FY24 was 2.3 per cent, as compared to the CAGR of 5.9 per cent in their export. India has become a net exporter of bulk drugs. During FY24, the value of export and import of bulk drugs was ₹39,632 Crore and ₹37,722 Crore respectively.

## Box X.4: Need to Enhance and Reimagine Pharma R&amp;D

The  pharmaceutical  industry  worldwide  can  be  divided  into  an  innovator  or  a  generic producer.  As  the  name  suggests,  'innovator'  firms  carry  out  extensive  research  to  bring new medicines or treatments for diseases to the world. Considering the extent of time and resources as also the risk involved in the process, the prices of such medicines are usually very high. Such firms thrive on monopolies created through intellectual property rights owned by them for these new medicines. In recent years, big innovator pharma companies have made a strategic move to invest in smaller, more agile research-oriented firms. Between 2021 and 2023, the investment amounted to USD 54 billion in small bio-tech firms. 16

India's  strength  in  the  pharmaceutical  sector  lies  in  being  a  cost  effective  and  efficient producer of existing off patented drugs- also called the generic industry. Even so research and  development  is  key  to  producing  the  same  medicines  once  they  get  off  patent  at  a fraction of the cost of the original drug. They thrive on competition. The world needs both the innovators and those that can provide drugs at a reasonable price, with the latter playing a vital role in enhancing social benefits. Hence, the strength of the industry lies in having a diverse combination of innovators and generic producers.

As we move towards realising the vision of Viksit Bharat, it is vital to promote innovation. The R&amp;D expenditure in the drugs and pharmaceutical sector in India averaged around 5 per cent of the sales turnover in FY20 and FY21 17 . The development of new drugs aimed at addressing unaddressed health concerns will improve the breadth and quality of healthcare access for the population, while producing better returns on investments.

The report 'Indian pharmaceutical sectorial system of innovation' 18  underscores the need for:

- i) fostering joint research amongst industry actors with the aim of making the sector more strategically collaborative rather than competitive.
2. ii) bolstering  industry-academic  interactions  for  applied  research,  in  particular  better participation of public knowledge-based institutions.
3. iii)  reducing  the  rigidity  of  communication  between  knowledge-based  institutions  in order to foster better knowledge exchange and collaboration in the areas of research, particularly with the inclusion of Tier 2 and Tier 3 institutions.
4. iv) supporting  secondments and placements between knowledge-based institutions and industry in order to better orient human capital development.
- v) strengthening communication channels amongst the knowledge-based institutions and intermediaries, particularly industry associations.
6. vi) increasing the channels of funding from venture capital and angel investors to support the process of ideation to market.

- vii)  better knowledge sharing amongst government bodies to promote an 'all of government approach'  to  innovation  thus  translating  into  more  coordinated  joint  research  in strategic areas.

The  government  has  taken  several  measures  to  create  and  nurture  an  ecosystem  that promotes innovation. This is reflected in the setting up of centres for excellence to promote collaborative research in the pharmaceutical sector, and in artificial intelligence including for  the  health  sector.  The  recently  introduced  Promotion  of  Research  and  Innovation  in Pharma MedTech Sector is expected to herald a transformation in the pharmaceutical sector towards innovation.

## Textile industry: Navigating challenges

10.21.  As per the National Accounts published by the Central Statistics Office, textiles, including the wearing apparel sector, generated a gross value added of ₹3.77 lakh Crore in FY23, which was about 10.6 per cent of the manufacturing GVA at current prices during the year. The sector also accounted for 29.3 per cent of the total non-corporate manufacturing GVA and 7.9 per cent of the corporate manufacturing GVA in FY23.

10.22.  India has a robust end-to-end value chain in the textile industry, spanning raw materials like  natural  and  MMF  fibre  to  the  final  product  and  covering  apparel,  home  textiles,  and technical  textiles.  India  is  the  world's  second-largest  clothing  manufacturer  and  one  of  the top five exporting nations. In FY24, the export of textiles and apparel, including handicrafts, increased by 1 per cent, reaching ₹2.97 lakh Crore. The sector is diversified, with readymade garments  accounting  for  the  largest  share  (41  per  cent)  in  the  total  exports  in  FY24,  with exports of ₹1.2 lakh Crore, followed by cotton textiles (34 per cent) and man-made textiles (14 per cent).

## Box X.5: Challenges and supportive initiatives in the textile industry

## Industry context and challenges

## Supportive initiatives

- The majority of India's textile and apparel production  capacity  is  on  account  of MSMEs, which account for over 80 per cent of the sector, and the average scale of  operations  is  relatively  small.  Thus, efficiency  and  economies  of  scale  from large-scale  modern  manufacturing  are limited.
- The fragmented nature of India's apparel sector, with raw materials sourced predominantly from Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Tamil Nadu, while spinning  capacities  are  concentrated  in southern  states,  contributes  to  higher transportation costs and delays.
- Other factors, such as India's heavy dependence on imported machinery, except in the spinning segment, inadequate availability of skilled manpower,  technological  obsolescence, etc, also act as significant constraints.
- NITI Aayog's recommendations for the  sector  include  supporting  domestic machine manufacturers through initiatives such as ATUFS, fostering R&amp;D, and promoting innovation.
- Priorities  also  include  creating  worldclass textile  infrastructure  with  plugand-play facilities. The focus will also  be  on  technological  upgradation, sustainability and circularity, quality and standards  and  promotion  of  handloom and handicraft products.
- Seven PM MITRA Parks, with a budget of ₹4,445 Crore, will be established from FY22 to FY28 in Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Gujarat,  Karnataka,  Madhya  Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Maharashtra.
- The parks will feature 1,000-acre industrial  infrastructure  and  "plug  and play" facilities.
- MoUs were signed with all seven states, with  JVs  and  SPVs  established  in  five states.
- The Government approved a PLI Scheme with  ₹10,683 Crores over five years for man-made fibre apparel and fabrics and technical textiles. It is expected to attract over  ₹19,000  Crore  in  investment  and create 2.5 Lakh jobs.
- Launched with an outlay of ₹1,480 Crore for FY21 to FY24, the National Technical Textiles  Mission  focuses  on  increasing the  use  of  technical  textiles  in  various sectors.
- It has four components: research innovation  &amp;  development,  promotion and market development, education, training and skilling, and export promotion. It has been extended to March 2026, with a sunset clause until March 2028.
- 137 research projects for ₹474 Crore have been approved so far.
- The  National  Handloom  Development Programme (NHDP) approved for FY22 to FY26 with an outlay of ₹998 Crore.
- In  FY24,  initiatives  were  undertaken  to establish  96  small  handloom  clusters. Nine mega handloom clusters have also been set up.

## Electronics industry: Powering the future

10.23.  India's electronics manufacturing sector has experienced significant growth since 2014, accounting for an estimated 3.7 per cent of the global market share in FY22. At the same time, the industry contributed 4 per cent to India's total GDP in FY22. Domestic production of electronic items  increased  significantly  to  ₹8.22  lakh  Crore,  while  exports  rose  to  ₹1.9  lakh  Crore  in FY23. India has become an attractive destination for investments in this sector, and substantial manufacturing capacities have been established in the country over the past five years. Many major brands, both foreign and domestic, have either established their own manufacturing facilities or have outsourced manufacturing to Electronics Manufacturing Services companies operating in India.

10.24.  Research by the Centre for Development Studies 19  shows that India has seen a significant increase  in  domestic  value  addition  (DVA),  employment,  wages  and  salaries  in  mobile manufacturing segment since FY17. The share of DVA in mobile phone output rose from an average of 8.7 per cent in FY17 to FY19 (Phase 1) to 22 per cent in FY20 to FY22 (Phase 2), indicating considerable increase in local participation. While the DVA as a ratio of exports may be low, participating in global value chains (GVC) increases in overall value added because of  economies of scale in manufacturing for the vast global market. The direct workforce in the production of mobile phones has more than tripled between FY17 to FY22, particularly benefiting female blue-collar workers. Wages and salaries increased by 317 per cent between phase 1 and phase 2. The study suggests that reducing service link costs is crucial for seamless participation  in  GVC,  necessitating  efforts  to  lower  transaction  costs.  This  recommends  a comprehensive  policy  approach,  including  low  import  tariffs  for  intermediate  inputs,  to replicate success in other sectors.

## Box X.6: Initiatives to Boost Electronics Industry

The  Indian  government  places  a  high  priority  on  electronics  hardware  manufacturing, which is a key aspect of both the "Make in India" and "Digital India" initiatives. In order to attract and encourage significant investments in the electronics value chain and boost exports, the government has introduced several schemes: (i) Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLI) for Large Scale Electronics Manufacturing, (ii) PLI IT Hardware, (iii) Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS), and (iv) Modified Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC 2.0). These schemes have been instrumental in driving growth in the country's electronics sector. As a result, the CAGR in the production of electronics goods from FY18 to FY23 was 16.19 per cent, while the exports increased by 35.7 percent in the same period.

To  bolster  the  electronics  manufacturing  ecosystem  in  the  country,  the  Scheme  for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) was introduced in 2020. The scheme offers a substantial financial incentive of 25 per cent on capital expenditure for a specific list of electronic goods that form the downstream value chain of electronic products. As of March 2024, a proposed investment of ₹12,638 Crore and committed incentives of ₹1758 Crore have been approved under the Scheme.

## PLI 2.0 for IT Hardware

## Electronics Manufacturing Clusters (EMC/EMC 2.0) Scheme

-  Notified in May 2023, the Scheme aims to broaden and deepen the manufacturing ecosystem  by  encouraging  localisation of components and sub-assemblies tied to  incremental  sales  and  investment thresholds.
-  The Scheme offers an average incentive of around 5 per cent on net incremental sales of eligible goods manufactured in India for six years.
-  The  EMC  Scheme,  launched  in  2012, supports  EMC  projects  and  Common Facility  Centres  to  attract  electronics manufacturing in India.
-  The EMC 2.0 Scheme, notified in April 2020, extends financial assistance for the above  projects,  with  applications  open until  March  2024  and  disbursement until March 2028.
- 
- Progress of the Scheme: Total production: ₹3367.63 Crore Additional investment: ₹269.44 Crore Additional direct jobs: 3493
-  Progress of Scheme: ₹184.91 Crore has been released under the scheme and is expected  to  attract  ₹40,429  Crore  in investment  and  generate  employment for 5.02 Lakh.

## Automotive industry

10.25.  The  Indian  automobile  industry  includes  major  global  auto  manufacturers  across different categories, as well as a vibrant auto component industry that produces various auto parts, body and chassis. The growth in the value of domestic production and consumption of automotive parts moderated during FY20 to FY23, compared to the previous five years. The production of auto components depends on the dynamics of the domestic and export markets. The  auto  components  sector  closely  follows  the  trends  in  automobile  production.  As  seen below, the pandemic affected the automobile sector considerably, which weakened the demand for automotive parts and, hence, their pace of expansion.

10.26.  In the first half of the last decade, passenger vehicles, such as cars and utility vehicles, experienced  significant  growth.  However,  the  pandemic  had  a  substantial  impact  on  all segments of the automotive industry. While passenger vehicles quickly recovered, the recovery period for two-wheelers, three-wheelers, and commercial vehicles is longer. Chart X.17 indicates that cars and utility vehicles (UVs), three wheelers, two wheelers and commercial vehicles are currently expanding as seen in the growth rates of recent years. In FY24, the country produced approximately 49 lakh passenger vehicles, 9.9 lakh three-wheelers, 214.7 lakh two-wheelers, and 10.7 lakh commercial vehicles.

## CROSS-CUTTING THEMES

## Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme

10.27.  Keeping in view India's vision of becoming 'Aatmanirbhar', Production Linked Incentive (PLI)  Schemes  for  14  key  sectors  were  announced  with  an  outlay  of  ₹1.97  Lakh  Crore  to enhance India's manufacturing capabilities and exports. Over ₹1.28 Lakh Crore of investment was  reported  until  May  2024,  which  has  led  to  production/sales  of  ₹10.8  Lakh  Crore  and employment generation (direct &amp; indirect) of over 8.5 Lakh. Export boosted by ₹4 Lakh Crore, with  significant  contributions  from  sectors  such  as  large-scale  electronics  manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, and telecom &amp; networking products.

10.28. PLI Scheme for White Goods (ACs and LED Lights) with a total outlay of ₹6,238 Crore was approved by the Government. As of May, 2024 the cumulative investment achieved by white goods(AC, LEDs) under the PLI scheme was ₹3181 crore which generated cumulative sales of ₹13320 crore. The PLI scheme for the remaining sector is covered under the respective sector sections.

## Micro, Small &amp; Medium Enterprises

10.29.  As  per  the  latest  information  available  from  the  Ministry  of  Statistics  &amp;  Programme Implementation, the share of MSMEs in all-India manufacturing output during the year FY22 was 35.4 per cent. Data Dissemination Portal of Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCIS) states that the share of export of MSME-specified products in all-India exports in 2023-24 was 45.7 per cent.

10.30. According to the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises for 2021-22 and 2022-23, 20   the  number  of  unincorporated  enterprises  in  India  increased  with  5.9  per  cent during the period of October 2022-September 2023 in comparison to April, 2021-March 2022. During the same period, Gross Value Added (GVA) per worker increased from ₹1,38,207 to ₹1,41,769 and Gross Value of Output (GVO) per establishment increased from ₹3,98,304 to ₹4,63,389. This shows an increased productivity with more efficient use of resources including labour, which is critical for sustained economic growth and competitiveness.

10.31.  The  Udyam  Registration  portal,  launched  in  July  2020,  has  been  instrumental  in formalising MSMEs by providing a simple, online, and free registration process based on selfdeclaration. As of 05 July 2024, 4.69 Crore MSMEs are registered on the Udyam Registration portal, including Informal micro enterprises registered on the Udyam Assist Platform. Udyam registration helps MSMEs avail themselves of the benefits of the Ministry of MSME schemes. Udyam-registered  MSMEs  are  also  eligible  for  priority  sector  lending  from  banks.  Udyam Portal has API linkage with 37 other portals, and through this, data sharing is facilitated. This has benefited the MSME sector considerably.

10.32.  The Union Budget 2023-24 allocated ₹9,000 Crore to the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust

10.33. Challenges  and  Opportunities: MSMEs  face  challenges,  including  issues  with formalisation and inclusion, limited access to finance, markets, technology, and digitalisation, infrastructural  bottlenecks,  and  skilling.  To  address  these  challenges,  the  Government  has implemented initiatives and platforms aimed at supporting formalisation, ease of registration and  grievance  redressal,  like  the  Samadhaan  Portal,  Sambandh  Portal,  and  Champions Portal, which aid in delayed payment issues, procurement monitoring, and speedy resolution

of grievances. The Global Value Chain Development Report (2019) highlights that although SMEs are underrepresented in global value chains, the digital economy offers them significant new opportunities. This is evident in India's MSME sector, where nearly 70 per cent of total e-commerce sales in 2020-21 were from MSMEs, reflecting a year-on-year growth rate of 6070 per cent 21 . Further, research shows that reimagining the level of regulations on the usage of factory space, like those relating to setbacks, will likely augment the manufacturing capacity, especially of the micro and small firms (Box X.9).

## Box X.9: Reimagining building regulations to augment manufacturing capacity

Existing industrial building regulations limit factory land usage, reducing land utility and resulting in unquantified costs. The report titled State of Regulation: Building Standards Reforms for Jobs and Growth 22  illustrates how land remains unutilised while complying with the four building regulations relating to ground coverage, setbacks, parking and floor area ratio.

1. Land  lost  due  to  Ground  Coverage: The  report  shows  that  under  the  ground coverage  regulations  on  factory  plots,  intended  to  control  density  and  promote groundwater  recharge,  a  factory  building  can  cover  no  more  than  40-60  per  cent of  the  plot,  depending  on  the  State  in  which  the  factory  conducts  its  operations.  In comparison, in Hong Kong, a factory will not lose any proportion of the plot; in the Philippines, only 30 per cent of the plot.
2. Land  lost  due  to  Setbacks: State-level  regulations  limit  the  horizontal  building expansion to minimise fire risk and ensure ventilation and light. The aforementioned report shows that regulations, however, do not account for modernisation in technology and  manufacturing  processes.  For  example,  the  use  of  fire-resistant  materials  and automatic fire-fighting equipment can effectively reduce hazards without locking up productive  land.  Moreover,  natural  light  and  ventilation  may  be  counterproductive in  certain  industries  like  chemicals,  pharmaceuticals,  and  electronics.  Setbacks  are particularly challenging for micro and small factories in certain States. The factories end up losing even 60-90 per cent of their land in certain States just to comply with these regulations. A mega factory in an Indian State loses ~2X more land to setbacks than one in the Philippines and ~5X more than the one in Singapore.
3. Land  lost  due  to  Parking  Regulations: State  governments  enforce  regulations mandating  off-street  parking  to  ease  street  congestion.  However,  research  suggests that these mandates may actually contribute to more congestion. Parking requirements do not align with actual demand, leading factories to lose a significant amount of land. The report finds that the factories across India lose ~12-70 per cent of their land to

22    Bhuvana, A., Kaur, S., and Roy, S., 2023. 'State of Regulation: Building standards reforms for jobs and growth'. Prosperiti, December

meet parking minimums. A factory in India may have to provide at least double the number of car parking spaces compared to Hong Kong, the Philippines, or Singapore.

4. Land lost due to Floor Ratio: States regulate the floor area ratio (FAR) to restrict vertical  expansion  on  designated  land  parcels,  aiming  to  manage  density,  alleviate traffic congestion, and facilitate the provision of essential utilities such as water and electricity. However, such regulations may inadvertently contribute to urban sprawl, thereby exacerbating road congestion and escalating utility provisioning expenses. On average, factories across states are only allowed to create floor space up to 1.3 times the plot size. With a 1000 sqm plot, an office building in Mumbai can be built up to 5000 sqm, whereas in Japan, it can go up to 13,000 sqm and 15,000 sqm in Singapore and Hong Kong.

There is a need to examine and rationalise building regulations to augment manufacturing capacity.  Better  utilisation  of  land  will  bring  the  fixed  cost  of  production  per  unit, thus  incentivising  the  entrepreneur  to  hire  more  workers  as  well.  Apart  from  studying international best practices, inter-state comparisons can help states identify best practices and adopt appropriate policies.

## Box X.10: ODOP: Crafting regional pride and economic empowerment

In 2018, the Government launched the One District One Product (ODOP) initiative to identify, brand, and promote the unique strengths of each district through a single, iconic product produced in that district to bridge the regional economic divide and nurture self-reliance across India's diverse districts. Districts that have more than one product identified have been categorised as secondary or tertiary products. These products cover various sectors, including agriculture, manufacturing, handloom and textiles, handicrafts, food processing, marine, and services. The initiative has identified 1102 products from 761 districts across the country till now.

To give an impetus to the ODOP initiative, the Union Budget of FY24 announced that States would be encouraged to set up a 'Unity Mall' in their state capital or most prominent tourism centre or the financial capital for the promotion and sale of their own ODOPs, GI products and other handicraft products, and for providing space for such products of all other states. These 'PM-Ekta Malls' aim to link the artisans of ODOP and consumers. These malls are creating a vibrant marketplace for the nation's unique products, aiming at both domestic and foreign markets.

The Government has been undertaking many initiatives to promote ODOP and showcase success  stories.  'ODOP  Sampark'  workshops  were  conducted  in  15  States  to  facilitate collaboration between the Centre and local sellers and revive indigenous industries. ODOP showcased India to the world at the various G20 events organised across the country during India's G20 Presidency, where the artisans, sellers and weavers got much visibility on the global stage during the events. 23

## Some of the success stories of ODOP

- Pack  sheds  and  irrigation  arteries,  funded  by  various  Government  initiatives,  have resulted in a 20 per cent surge in the production of Shopian apples in Kashmir.
- NGOs, local administration, and over 700 farmers in the Uttarkashi district of Uttarakhand have been empowered with organic farming skills through 15 tailored training sessions. Equipped with vital tools  for  1000+  beneficiaries,  red  rice  production  in  this  district increased considerably.
- Nearly 1,50,000 tribal families in Araku Valley, Andhra Pradesh, have boosted coffee output by 20 per cent, fuelled by Girijan Co-Operative Corporation loans.
- Over 5,000 trained workers in the Kandhamal district of Odisha have joined 1,300 farmers in garnering domestic and international turmeric markets. Government procurement of the spice has also increased by about 70 per cent. Speedy testing labs, financial aid in the form of subsidies, loans, and support for formalisation in the Bhatinda district of Punjab have led to a 30 per cent rise in honey production. 24

## Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs)

10.34.  As of March 31, 2023, 254 CPSEs were operational. Around 66 per cent of the CPSEs operated in the service sector; the rest in manufacturing, processing &amp; generation and mining &amp; exploration. CPSEs achieved stronger financial parameters FY23 and FY24. The total Market Capitalisation (M-cap) of 63 CPSEs traded on stock exchanges of India was ₹16.69 Lakh Crore as of March 31, 2023, as against ₹15.46 Lakh Crore as of March 31, 2022, reflecting an increase of 7.95 per cent 25 . The overall net profit of operating CPSEs in FY23 was ₹2.12 Lakh Crore. The major financial parameters of CPSEs are presented in the Charts below.

## Industrial Credit

10.35.  Industrial credit growth depends on a host of factors, including the cyclicality of economic activity,  relativity  in  the  availability  and  cost  of  bank  funds  and  other  market  options,  the position of own resources of industrial enterprises and the banking system's own risk appetite. Recovering from the pandemic-driven moderation in FY21, industrial credit picked up strongly in the next year. In FY23, credit growth was mainly driven by large industries; however, this growth was hampered by a decrease in credit to certain sectors.

## Industrial R&amp;D and Innovation

10.36.  As the public sector presence in core manufacturing is limited to only about 7 per cent, its  share in industrial R&amp;D is also limited. An initial review of the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2023 indicator shows that the U.S. is leading in corporate R&amp;D, followed by China and Germany. Middle-income countries like India, Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia also experienced an increase in their R&amp;D 26 . As industrial R&amp;D in India is highly concentrated in a few sectors, the top five sectors account for more than 70 per cent.

## CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

10.38. The  foregoing  analysis  gives  an  indication  of  the  emerging  trends  in  the  Indian industrial landscape. First, over the last decade, there has been a significant realignment of output shares among industrial segments. Sectors like chemicals, wood products and furniture, pharmaceuticals,  transport  equipment,  steel  and  machinery  and  equipment  have  gained  in strength.  Some  of  these  are  important  industrial  intermediates  and  consumer  goods,  while the others cater to requirements of capital formation. On the other hand, sectors like textiles, food products, beverages and tobacco and petroleum products and leather lost their relative positions.

10.39.  Secondly, the export-import balance of different industrial segments has vastly varied over  the  last  few  years.  Consistently,  major  net  exporters  include  industries  such  as  steel, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles. On the other hand, import dependency in key sectors like coal, capital goods and chemicals continue.

10.40. Thirdly, the medium-term outlook on the demand for capital goods and key construction inputs like steel and cement is likely to be positive, as there are clear signs that capital formation in  the  private  sector  is  gathering  momentum.  Global  uncertainties  raise  question  mark  on export demand and the domestic cost of production due to dependence on critical imported inputs like coal, petroleum, steel and machinery.

- Under the Global Innovation Index (GII), India's rank improved consistently.
- India ranks first in the lower middle-income countries and among central and southern Asian economies.
- India  holds  the  top  rank globally  in  the  domestic market scale indicator.

10.41.  Government has taken many recent initiatives to improve ease of doing business, reduce compliance burden and to alleviate logistic and infrastructural bottlenecks. The PLI schemes for key sectors have attracted significant investments, boosted production, sales and exports and generated jobs, particularly in the case of white goods. Where governments across the country can help is in reviewing, amending, relaxing and annulling regulations that are messy, stifling, counterproductive and raise the cost of operations for businesses without commensurate public benefits. Decisions that are best left to the entrepreneurs are mandated by law, leading to fear of prosecution. The path to further industrialisation in India is paved with deregulation.

10.42.  Two common requirements across industries relate to incentivising R&amp;D and innovation and improving the skill levels of the workforce. With respect to both, industry must take the lead.  Commitment  to  R&amp;D  must  be  in  the  DNA  of  the  industry,  independent  of  any  fiscal incentive, since it is about global competitiveness and profitability. With active collaboration between industry and academia and emphasis on vocational education in curriculums, India can meet the skill shortage more effectively than hitherto.

10.43.  Sectors  with  widely  scattered  production  units  like  textiles,  and  the  MSME  sector in  general,  seek  solutions  to  constraints  of  supply  chain  management,  market  access  and formalisation.  There  have  been  many  focused  policy  initiatives  addressing  these  issues,  as mentioned in the section on MSME; further action along the following lines may be considered at the levels of the appropriate governments in a cooperative federalism mode:

- (a) Ensuring support systems to develop MSME projects and their bankability and adequate financing arrangements for such projects
- (b)  targeted facilitation and incentivisation of employment-intensive MSME segments
- (c) progressively easing the compliance requirements with a single-window mechanism for clearances, digitisation of processes and equipping MSMEs to handle these processes with ease
- (d)  providing grassroots-level facilitation to ensure market access to MSME products
- (e) government-industry-academia collaboration to upskill the workforce.
- 10.44. Upgrading the statistics on industry on the following lines will aid policymaking:
- (a) Updated  index  of  industrial  production,  incorporating  the  vast  changes  that  have occurred in India's manufacturing landscape. State level variants of such indices will help understanding the emerging geographical patterns
- (b)  Regular indicators of the dynamics of production and employment in MSMEs
- (c) Information on industry-wise gross disbursement of bank credit (as opposed to the data on outstanding credit currently available), industry-wise monthly gross financial flows through domestic and external equity and debt routes as well as other financing sources.
