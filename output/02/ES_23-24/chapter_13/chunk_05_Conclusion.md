## CONCLUSION

13.91. The most important human factor in enlivening these principles to life is also one of the most elusive in modern life - Thahraav (Bgjko) or Settlement/Contentment that comes with Equanimity.  It is not stoppage, it is not stagnation, and it is not even a compromise. It  is  a  human's  ability  to  have  the  confidence  and  the  power  to  opt  for  internal  stability  to prepare for and accept outside change. It is only when humans can channel this energy that they can stop asking for more. It is the absence of such contentment that has made erstwhile communal things in the home become individual - e.g., television.  Things unavailable didn't cause grown men to cry and children to shrink from playing with others. This stands in contrast with the consumption-oriented living of today, where every individual is a consumer (especially children 81 ), instead of a family. That's why households, today, need more devices per person as compared to a single television earlier. Within that one statement lies the entire linkage between social mores, overconsumption, disposability, and growing mountains of trash. As per IFC, ' world generates over 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste annually 82 , and is expected to increase 70% by 2050 .'

13.92.  The hunger to consume more and more means we keep missing the bus in the global discourse  on  sustainability,  by  constantly  suggesting  rewiring  the  pathways  to  renewables rather than attacking the root of the problem. Treating the symptoms to cure a growing disease.

13.93.  It's time to rebuild societies with equanimity.

13.94.  Internal equanimity contributes to more acceptance of others and, therefore to better human relations,  which  we  now  know,  is  also  more  conducive  to  larger,  cohesive  families, and consequently better social and sustainable impact. Access to more material choices and economic betterment shouldn't throw us so off-balance that we forget we come from Nature and must return to it. Our conscious and unconscious choices should not be divorced from the drivers of life on earth. Hence, the global movement on climate change must be accommodative of sovereign choices and economic needs, but centred on individual behaviour - 'LiFE'.
