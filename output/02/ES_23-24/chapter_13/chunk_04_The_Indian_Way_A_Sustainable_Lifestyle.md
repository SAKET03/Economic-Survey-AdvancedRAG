# The Indian Way: A Sustainable Lifestyle

## THE INDIAN WAY: A SUSTAINABLE LIFESTYLE

'mātā bhūmih putruahan prthivyā : 68 '' (Prithvi Sukta, Shlok 12)

13.64.  Time and again, when a major adversity shakes the world out of its stupor, the relative resilience of Indians is a subject of great surprise 69 . The natural resilience emanates from this land's deep, spiritual, and philosophical understanding of the concept of cycles of creation and destruction.

13.65.  Nowhere, it is greatly reflected than in our relationship with 'Nature' that not only has tremendous power, but also a mind and temper of its own. We need to be in sync with its order because nature is not going to change its laws for the assumed strategies of man. Hence, global environmental and sustainability strategy must be in accordance with the cyclic temperament of Nature rather than in the misplaced belief that our industrial siloed actions can alter even a sliver of its fabric. It is here where India can help.

13.66.  Even as the traditional scientific approaches to climate change are welcome, it's high time  that  India  adopted  and  disseminated  its  wisdom  of  pursuing  a  life  of  sustainability. While India agrees with the need for top-down policy-level changes, we also believe in the collective power of small individual actions. That each person contributes to both emission generation as well as emission reduction is a simple fact that we must take into account while designing policies, and awareness programmes, or even while tabulating statistics related to the environment.

13.67. In Sukla Yajurveda (36-17), the sages recited the verse:

¶i`fFkoh 'kkfUrjki% 'kkfUrjks"k/;% 'kkfUr% A

Peace and Balance in Earth, Water, Plants, Trees, and Gods. May there be balance in you, in space, and in everything.

## MISSION LIFE (LIFESTYLE FOR ENVIRONMENT)

13.68.  This thought process was at the base of Mission LiFE 70 , announced by Prime Minister Modi, at the 2021 UN Climate Change Conference (UNFCC COP2026) which seeks to bring individual responsibility to the forefront of the global climate narrative. It derives its philosophy from ancient Indian philosophy that espouses a naturally sustainable lifestyle in accordance with  nature,  steering  individual  actions  and  collective  demand  towards  pro-planet  choices. It encompasses a comprehensive but non-exhaustive list of 75 LiFE Actions for adoption by individuals to live more sustainably.

68    (Rigveda,1/90/6,7,8) invokes divine intervention to bliss and protect the environment. ' madhu vātāh ritāyate madhu ksaranti sindhavah mādvih nah santusadhi. madhu naktamutusāsu madhumatpārthiva rajah madhu ksorastu suryah mādhirgābo bhavantu nah ''

69  The Subprime Crisis (https://tinyurl.com/5hdy2s82), The Covid-19 Pandemic (https://tinyurl.com/yzx5nw72)

70    Mission focuses on 7 themes - Saving Energy and Water, Reducing Single Use Plastic and E-waste, Adopting Sustainable Food Systems, Reducing Waste and adopting Healthy Lifestyles

13.69.  Taking this philosophy forward, LiFE should have a doctrine for the world, resting on 5 fundamental principles.

## Individual action is the core of Climate Responsibility

13.70.  As described in the previous sections, no economic or industrial strategy is going to be successful without the world's population changing its approach to climate and environment. Hence, before compelling poorer nations to change their developmental journey, it's necessary for individuals, especially in the developed world, to alter their lifestyle in favour of simple behavioural changes, all of which directly contribute to mitigation efforts.

13.71. India has great experience in individual-led sustainable behaviours - using a cloth for kitchen cleaning instead of tissue papers, leaves instead of disposable plates and packaging material,  water-based toilet  cleaning  systems,  reuse  and  upcycling  of  household  items,  and even ancient home remedies of pest control focussed on route deviation rather than killing. Practising a lifestyle  where  we  indulge  in  less  of  'fast  fashion',  getting  things  repaired  than thrown at the first sight of discomfort, turning off lights when not using the room/area, etc, and digital consciousness in the form of accepting bills as e-bills rather than paper bills, conserving electricity through the purchase of energy-efficient products, switching off when not in use, adopting  cleantech  products,  virtual  meetings  but  physical  activities  like  outdoor  run,  use of solar water heaters.  This is not even taught, and it's imbibed, learned, and passed on to successive generations. Unfortunately, this is changing in favour of capitalistic practices derived from market societies, since they are, unfortunately, seen as symbols of upward migration.

13.72. At the core of it, it does seem duplicitous to talk about sustainability to poorer countries without changing anything about global lifestyle driven by overconsumption, beef-eating, and

fast fashion. Individuals must be encouraged to give up voluntarily these energy sins and bring their actions in line with their stated purpose. A change in demand will automatically cause a change in supply by relevant industries.

13.73. Voluntary relinquishment is not new in India. With a historical ashram-based 71   culture where householders give up their material desires voluntarily to advance towards devotion to society and God, the principles have been used for greater community welfare even in present times. The 'Give It Up' LPG Subsidy Scheme is perhaps the best example of this theory in practice at scale.  #GiveItUp' campaign launched in 2015, aimed at motivating 5.7 million Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) users who could afford to pay the market price for LPG to voluntarily surrender their LPG subsidy to help pay for LPG cylinders to those rural women who depended on firewood for cooking food. Cooking on open fires and on inefficient wood-burning stoves emits close to 25% of global black carbon emissions. This brilliant individual renunciation for a higher cause not only reduced ill-health incidences in women but also directly impacted climate change.

13.74. Voluntary planting of trees and keeping surroundings clean and minimalistic contribute directly to environmental impact. Usage of locally sourced nature-based artisan choices like pattals, and bamboo bottles, refraining from excessive plastic use, and, making conscious choices in favour of sustainability will go a long way in curbing large-scale demand for environmentally adverse things.

13.75. One area where individual action is most desired and most needed is water reuse, less wastage, and water conservation. Water is not only the elixir of life but a non-negotiable as far as existence is concerned. The greatest news about Mars was the possibility of water on that planet 72 , such is its importance. So, even as governments step in to increase water supply, bring in efficiency, and redirect non-potable water to other uses, Individuals must drastically reduce their  wastage  of  this  extremely  precious  resource.  Small  actions  such  as  collecting  kitchen water to water plants, not leaving taps endlessly open, and using rainwater harvesting to utilise rainwater are both doable and desirous in the context of climate change.

## Collective policy reflective of Individual pro-planet choices

13.76.  Consistency. Compounding. Two words when practised can make and break empires. Small  but  consistent  actions  have  a  large  compounding  effect  observable  across  time.  The Japanese even have a term for it - 'Kaizen'. As described above, individual choices on a daily basis  can  help  in  sustainability,  but  even  greater  is  a  collective  policy  of  pro-planet  small everyday choices, but nudged and mandated by the government. These are reflected in several actions as follows:

71    Four ashrams or stages (25 year each) in life of an individual - Balavastha (Childhood and Learning), Grihasta (Householder's life of pursuing material desires), Vanaprastha (giving back to society), Sanyas (Renunciation and Oneness with God)

- (a)    Using air-conditioning and thermostats at more optimum and sustainable temperatures 73 : As pointed out by the Prime Minister of India, there is little sense in keeping temperatures artificially low to 17-18 degrees and then using a blanket. Default settings on ACs and temperatures in public places like malls, offices, and airports can be increased from 18 to 24-25 degrees. Popularly called the 'Air conditioning paradox' 74 , as this article 75 beautifully describes, it is a Catch-22 situation ' One of the great ironies of climate change is that as the planet warms, the technology that people need to stay cool will  only  make the climate hotter .'    With  a  large  population  cramped in small places, India cannot afford to go down the individual air-conditioning route, where every small room has an AC and makes the neighbouring air so worse off that they require another, thus setting off a vicious circle. Not earlier than 15 years ago also, most households in India did not have access to ACs and instead relied on a combination of approaches - khus cooling with intermittent use of water coolers and earthen pots for water. The capitalist approach to solving any problem requires manufacturing at scale, thereby ushering in modern air-conditioners, which seem to have made the problem worse. India must vote to bring in a mix of modern air-conditioners and our traditional mechanisms - ventilated construction,  large  windows,  use  of  local  materials,  water-based  cooling  systems,  and usage of fans wherever possible.
- (b)    Reducing  the  need  to  carry  disposable  plastic  bags  repeatedly  on  errands , both by decreasing consumption and replacing them with reusable fabric bags. More than 1 million bags are used every minute with an average working life of 15 minutes, but stay on the earth's surface forever, unless recycled.
- (c)    Building a culture of water reuse through individual behaviour change and mandated design specifications in favour of structures like rainwater harvesting. Water is becoming scarcer and scarcer resources. Some regions of the world have almost no access to fresh water. Governments should mandate water-efficient technologies and re-examine water-wasting ones (e.g., Reverse Osmosis water machines, single flush toilets).
- (d)    Practicing sustainable agriculture through the use of local seeds and natural farming practices. Agriculture residue to be used for mulching and composting.
- (e)    Fiscal  Incentives  for  large  households  rather  than  single  or  two-person households, indirectly nudge societies to favour sustainable choices.

13.77. Increased demand will re-energise the market for sustainable, traditional products that were made by local skilled workers and did not require industries from across the world to produce. Moreover, products of ivory, leather, and those made of endangered species must be individually discouraged and policy-banned. Circularity and reuse of waste products must be incentivised by the government. A good example will be the Government's mandate for ethanol blending in petrol, achieving the target of 10% in 2022.

73  Use of AC continuously can increase city temperatures by up to 2 degrees Celsius.

13.78.  Another area where individual choices and government action must converge is Fashion and Textiles. As per UNEP, the fashion industry is the second-biggest consumer of water and is responsible for 2-8% of global carbon emissions, 24% of insecticides, and 11% of pesticides. Apart from voluntary reuse and upcycling of clothes, there is a strong need for a Policy on Circularity in Textiles in India, as currently, less than 50% of textile waste in India undergoes any kind of reuse, repair, or remanufacture.

## Incorporation of local and sustainable geography and culture

13.79.  'Annam Brahmam' or Food is God. Ancient India wrote this in black and white and left it for successive generations to ponder upon. However, in the flurry of everything that is 'not us' being better, local food gave way to packaged fast-food and food choices different from the geography of our existence. Even today, Indian cuisine is primarily plant-based. This doesn't mean that everyone is a vegetarian; it means that the bulk of our food base remains vegetarian - rice, dal, roti, and meat are an added separate delicacy. It is the same in our packaged food such as chips which are almost 99.99% plant-based, given the diverse food people eat across a country this large. Most of the cuisines are heavily dependent on local geography which not only provides a medicinal value to food but also reduces ecological footprint and reduces energy requirements. This is opposed to the global practice of industry-supplied veganism where in

order to eat more sustainable food, one has to be dependent on avocados flying from halfway across the world or soy milk which has previously caused Amazon rainforest degradation 76 .

13.80.  Good  health  is  a  great  economic  contributor  also  because  all  episodes  of  ill  health cause  double  economic  losses  -  reduction  of  productive  time  and  costs  spent  on  recovery. While modern medicine has done a great job of germ-based infection recovery and biological engineering, India has practised Ayurveda for years, which emphasises existence in accordance with nature, prevention rather than cure, and natural remedies rather than clinical supplements with an unclear understanding of their long-term damage. 'Popping the pill' culture must give way to a greater curiosity around the 'why' of ill health (which is not due to any accident / congenital issue/toxicity) and the role that our local food and medicinal systems will play in bringing down their incidences.

13.81. It's  time  that  the  world adopted this Golden Principle of sustainable ingestion - eat local, eat fresh, eat sustainably:

- -More plant-based diet.
- -Use of leaf-based disposable plates instead of Styrofoam and single-use plastic.
- -Use of fermented products (as is dominant in Asian cultures) that use natural sun storage for achieving the desired state.
- -Upcycling food waste, or organic composting food waste (sour milk to paneer and reuse of whey water for lentils).
- -Growing medicinal herbs such as Tulsi, and neem around us.
- -Afforestation of water-table saving trees.
- -Eating seasonally and locally - e.g. more millets than quinoa.
- -Production of natural varieties and seed harvesting are to be publicly incentivised.

## Public Policy and not the Market at the helm of undertaking the 'right' decision

13.82.  This approach focuses on influencing individual behaviours through policy approaches. How individuals behave and choose to consume is shaped by the surrounding norms, policies, incentives, and infrastructure, and herein there is a role for governments, community leaders, and media.

13.83.  The  Ujala  program,  launched  in  2015,  to  encourage  energy-efficient  LED  lights has resulted in energy savings of around 48 billion kWh per year and estimated savings of USD 2.5bn per year. People were incentivised to adopt these LED lights by bringing down buying costs for people. This was possible through govt. plans for bulk procurement and supply. By harnessing individual and collective awareness efforts, including even of children, the program brought about widespread change. Thus, a people-behaviour lifestyle change approach directly helped in climate mitigation.

76    Retrieved  from  Greenpeace  (https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/victories/amazon-rainforest-deforestation-soymoratorium-success/)

13.84.  According to the International Energy Agency's modelling, the adoption of the kinds of actions and measures targeted by the LiFE initiative worldwide would reduce annual global CO2 emissions by more than 2 billion tonnes (Gt) in 2030 (20% of the emissions reductions needed by 2030) and in consumer savings of about USD 440 billion. That is non-trivial.

'… transformation on the supply side will not be enough; demand-side transformations will also be essential to stay within planetary boundaries. Energy requirements for providing decent living standards to the global population can be drastically reduced, but in addition to the use of the most efficient available technologies, this implies a radical transformation of  consumption  patterns,  including  political  procedures  to  prioritise  between  competing consumption claims.'  77

13.85.  The importance of public investment in undertaking transformational projects cannot be  emphasised  enough.  Our  world's  history  is  replete  with  such  examples  -  post-WW  II reconstruction,  exploration  of  space,  the  development  of  the  internet  (during  its  prototype stages), and the Highways construction project in the USA in the Sixties - were handled and executed by the public sector, based on government funding or funding by public authorities domestic, international or multilateral. Similarly, today, there is a need for public investment in carbon sequestration, carbon sinks, battery storage technologies, and green hydrogen will obviate problems with intellectual property rights and help assert the global public nature of solutions.

13.86.  However, this must be accommodated by awareness campaigns towards Mission LiFE in all relevant areas, starting early from school onwards, as was done for behaviour change towards Open Defecation Free (ODF) campaign in Swachh Bharat.

## Mindful consumption of resources, based on need and not greed

13.87.  It  is  unfortunate that the predominant measure of a country's worth comes from an ever-increasing GDP, which is driven primarily by consumption in a capitalist world. Derek Brower, Amanda Chu, and Myles McCormick say in FT 78 , that ' Capitalism won't deliver the energy transition fast enough. For all the cleantech advances and renewable deployment in recent decades, fossil fuels' share of total global energy use was 86% in 2000 and 82% in 2023 .'

13.88.  Countries  must  therefore  look  at  encouraging  sustainable  lifestyles  -  emphasis  on low wastages on adjusting life in a way that 'wants' don't become 'needs'. That's living well but harmoniously. Excesses of materialism only have negative externalities - more wastage, more littering, more eternal garbage sitting on the earth's surface, less happiness - the law of diminishing marginal utility of the happiness-ownership curve can be seen in everyday lives. Most of the generation that is between ages 30 and 70 has seen a life where disposability and

dispensability were not a part of existence. Materiality was linked to long periods of sacrifice and the rare acquisition that fuelled feelings of happiness.

13.89.  It's a philosophical shift from the way we understand life. A large body of research 79 has brought forward the theory of the 'Paradox of Choice' that runs counterintuitive to the ideas of Capitalism.  Even though choice is good for us, its relationship to contentment is quite complicated, and choice overload 80   leads to a large set of negative outcomes. These range from indecisiveness to confusion to complications to dissatisfaction. In the Picture of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde says ' Nowadays, people know the price of everything and the value of nothing .'

13.90.  The  final  principle  of  LiFE  implores  us  to  enjoy  the  intrinsic  value  of  things  and experiences,  without  overburdening  ourselves  with  overconsumption.  It  is  not  about  living ascetically but living mindfully. When leaving half a bottle of water, and picking up another, it's time to remember that this plastic will not only outlive us, but also our children and our grandchildren, and that is probably not the future we wish to bequeath them.
