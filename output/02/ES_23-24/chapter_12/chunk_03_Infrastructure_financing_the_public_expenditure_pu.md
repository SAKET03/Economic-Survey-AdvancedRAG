# Infrastructure financing: the public expenditure push

## INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING: THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PUSH

12.3.  This  section  brings  out  two  important  facts  about  infrastructure  financing  in  India. Firstly,  despite  many  financial  innovations  in  infrastructure  financing  in  the  recent  years, capital expenditure by the Union and State Governments still have the central role in funding of large-scale infrastructure projects. Secondly, with the emergence of a number of new funding instruments and strategies, the infrastructure financing space has become complex, and, given the  differential  definitions  and  patterns  followed  in  maintenance  of  statistics  by  different agencies, it is difficult to aggregate the total flow of funds for the creation of infrastructure in any given year.

12.4. Even though budgetary capital expenditure cannot be equated to infrastructure spending 4 , the infrastructure thrust of the Government has led to an unprecedented increase in capital expenditure. Chart XII.1 shows that the capital expenditure of the Union Government increased by 2.2 times from FY21 to FY24 (PA) while that of the State governments increased by 2.1 times during the same period.

12.5.  The capital expenditure of the Union Government broadly includes two componentsthe  spending  by  its  line  departments  and  the  gross  budgetary  support  (GBS)  given  to  the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). The share of gross budgetary support to two key connectivity  segments,  i.e.,  Railways  and  National  Highway  Authority  of  India,  in  the  total capital expenditure of the Union Government increased from 36.4 per cent in FY21 to 42.9 per cent in FY24 (RE). These two components of capital expenditure increased by 2.6 times from FY21 to FY24 (RE) in their absolute values.

12.6. The aggregate investible resources of the CPSEs consists of the GBS and the resources raised by CPSEs themselves. In order to optimise the combined borrowing cost of the Union Government and the CPSEs, the higher-cost borrowings of the two major infra-CPSEs-NHAI and Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) - were progressively reduced from FY21 to FY24. This is, to a large extent, reflected in the reduction in the own resources of the CPSEs in

4    Capital expenditure of the Government includes its spending to create any capital asset, which may not be created under a sector classified as infrastructure under the harmonious definition of infrastructure.

Chart XII.1. However, this reduction was more than offset by the expansionary GBS, thereby allowing investment in roads and railways to increase sizeably between FY21 and FY24.

12.7.  The support of the Union Government for capital expenditure of the State Governments and  instititions  increased  by  31.6  per  cent  during  FY21  and  FY24.  Further  analysis  of  the capital expenditure of the State Governments is not possible as the data on the GBS by the State Government to the State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) and the resources mobilised by SPSEs themselves are not available in a consolidated form.

12.8. Charts XII.3 through XII.9 on important non-government sources of funding reiterates the fact that the recent infrastructure thrust in India, especially the surge in connectivity projects, has  banked  predominantly  on  public  expenditure.  The  net  flow  of  funds  to  infrastructure sectors through bank credit between March 2023 to March 2024 was only around ₹79,000 crore, much less than the GBS by the Union Government for either railways or roads. Charts XII.3 to XII.5 also show that the net flow of bank credit between March 2020 and March 2024 was concentrated in only a few sectors roads, airports and power. However, the credit growth to infrastructure sectors in FY24 recovered to 6.5 per cent, as against the growth of 2.3 per cent, in FY23.

12.9. The gross inflow of external commercial borrowings to infrastructure sectors also picked up to USD 9.05 billion in FY24, as against an average of USD 5.91 billion during FY20 to FY23.

The  resource  mobilisation  by  infrastructure  sectors 5 through  debt  and  equity  issuances  in the capital market was just over ₹1,00,000 crore during FY24. Real estate investment trusts REITs) have raised ₹18,840 crore from year 2019 to 2024 while Infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) raised a total of ₹1,11,294 crore in the last five years (2019-2024).

## Box XII.1: Major Mechanisms for fostering Public Private Partnership (PPP)

## Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC)

- Apex body for appraisal of central sector PPP projects
- 77 projects with a total cost of ₹2.4 lakh crore were recommended from FY15 to FY24.

## Viability Gap Funding (VGF)

- Assistance to financially unviable but socially/economically desirable PPP projects.
- 57 projects costing ₹64,926.1 crore were granted in-principle approval and 27 projects costing ₹25,263.8 crore were granted final approval from FY15 to FY24.
- Total  VGF approval of ₹5,813.6 crore (both Union Government &amp; State share) from FY15 to FY24.

## India Infrastructure Project Development Fund Scheme

- Financial support for project development of PPP Projects
- Notified in November 2022 with a total outlay of ₹150 crore for three years from FY23 to FY25.
- 28 proposals have been approved.

## Other Supportive instruments

- Reference  guides  for  setting  up  state  PPP  units,  PPP  project  appraisal,  and  project implementation  mode  selection  have  been  made.  Web-based  toolkits,  post-award contract management toolkit and contingent liability for project sponsoring authorities have been developed to help them in PPP structuring.

## National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)

12.10.  NMP  was  announced  in  August  2021  on  the  principle  of  'asset  creation  through monetisation'  i.e.,  tapping  private  sector  investment  for  new  infrastructure  creation.  The aggregate monetisation potential under NMP was estimated at ₹6.0 lakh crore through core assets of the Government, over four-years from FY22 to FY25 6 . The pipeline contained more than 20 asset classes across 12 Ministries.

12.11.  Ministries are proactively working on developing a pipeline and transactions have been undertaken in line with their strategic initiatives. During the first two years, i.e., 2021-22 and 2022-23, transactions aggregating to about ₹2.3 lakh crore in accruals or private investments were  completed  under  the  core  asset  monetisation  programme.  Further,  in  2023-24, transactions aggregating to ₹1.51 lakh crore in accruals or private investments were completed, 1.55 times those achieved in 2021-22.
