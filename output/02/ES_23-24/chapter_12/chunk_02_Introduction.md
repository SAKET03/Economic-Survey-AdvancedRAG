## INTRODUCTION

12.1.  Creation of resilient, world-class infrastructure-physical, social, financial and digital-is a key plank of India's policy strategy to become ViksitBharat @ 2047. However, recent studies by the Asian Development Bank 1  and the World Bank 2  and recent estimates made by agencies like CRISIL 3 have identified gaps in infrastructure investment in different sectors. Against this background, this  chapter  examines  the  recent  developments  in  India's  infrastructure  space with a special focus on the progress achieved in FY24.

12.2. The  Chapter  is  divided  into  six  sections.  Section  II  investigates  the  question  of infrastructure financing within the limitations of data and stresses the need for greater balance between private capital and public investment, which will be constrained by the requirements of fiscal consolidation by the Government. Section III discusses sectoral developments, challenges and outlook. Discussion on financial infrastructure and on social infrastructures like health and education is not covered in this chapter as these subjects are discussed in chapters 2, 7 and 8 respectively. The fourth section shows the glimpse of the challenges and the opportunities across the infrastructure sector. Section V examines the efforts by the Government to reduce the  bottlenecks  in  India's  infrastructure  sector.  Section  VI  summarises  the  discussions  and presents some important aspects of the way forward.
