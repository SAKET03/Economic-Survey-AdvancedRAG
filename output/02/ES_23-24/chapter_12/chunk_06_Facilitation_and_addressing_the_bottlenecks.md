# Facilitation and addressing the bottlenecks

## FACILITATION AND ADDRESSING THE BOTTLENECKS

## National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)

12.70.  The portal provides opportunities for Ministries and States/UTs to collate all major infrastructure  projects  at  a  single  location,  thus  acting  as  a  centralised  portal  to  track  and review project progress across all economic and social infrastructure sub-sectors. The portal also enables project-sponsoring authorities to showcase investment opportunities to national and international investors.

12.71. The  Government  launched  the  NIP  with  a  forward-looking  approach  and  with  a projected infrastructure investment of around ₹111 lakh crore during FY20-25 to provide highquality infrastructure across the country 30 . NIP includes infrastructure projects of more than ₹100 crore each covering greenfield and brownfield investments. As of 12 April 2024, out of

30 Report of the Task Force National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), 2020 - https://tinyurl.com/3j48tuhj

the  total  capital  outlay  under  NIP,  the  transportation  sector  dominates  with  a  contribution of  58  per  cent,  followed  by  the  energy  sector  at  24  per  cent,  and  the  water  and  sanitation sector at 12 per cent, and balance five per cent by other sectors such as social infrastructure, communication, etc.

12.72.  NIP currently has over 9,666 projects and schemes covering 37 sub-sectors (as on 12th April  2024)  that  are  hosted  and  monitored  through  the  India  Investment  Grid  (NIP-PMG) integrated portal. Out of these projects, 4,413 projects (46 per cent) are under implementation while 2,062 projects (21 per cent) have been completed.

## Project Monitoring Group (PMG)

12.73. PMG is an institutional mechanism for expeditious resolution of issues and regulatory bottlenecks in projects with an investment of ₹500 crores and above. The PMG mechanism allows project proponents to raise issues with concerned the Government agencies that are causing hindrances in the implementation of projects.

12.74. PMG has facilitated resolution of 6,867 issues in 1,443 projects worth ₹46.1 lakh crore. The PMG portal has on-boarded 2,457 projects worth ₹62.5 lakh crore until March 2024 which consist  of  all  important  mega  infrastructure  projects  including  high-impact  PM  GatiShakti projects and critical infrastructure gap projects.

## PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS-NMP)

12.75. PMGS-NMP  is  a  whole-of-government  approach  adopted  to  facilitate  integrated planning of multimodal infrastructure through collaboration among the Ministries concerned. PMGS-NMP has been adopted at the State and Centre level to assess last-mile connectivity gaps and ensure seamless movement of people and goods. This is a transformative approach for planning multimodal infrastructure connectivity to economic nodes, thereby bringing logistics efficiency.

12.76.  As on March 2024, 43 Ministries have been onboarded on PMGS-NMP portal. 1,530 data layers (642 Ministry data layers &amp; 888 State data layers) of Ministries and States have been uploaded on the PMGS-NMP portal. 16 Ministries have a dedicated PMGS cell which has streamlined project planning. 22 social sector Ministries onboarded with over 200 data layers mapped on portal. All 36 States and Union Territories have formed State-level institutional mechanism and State Master Plan portals and 533 projects have been planned on NMP. Network Planning Group, a central-level institutional mechanism of the PMGS-NMP has evaluated 149 project proposals with total estimated project cost of ₹13.3 lakh crore.

## Box XII.25: Implementation of NLP gains steam

lndia's focus on improving logistics infrastructure has led to an improvement of six places from 44 in 2018 to 38 in 2023 out of 139 countries in the Logistics Performance lndex of the World Bank.

National Logistics Policy (NLP) was launched in September 2022 to complement PMGSNMP i.e., to drive business competitiveness through an integrated, efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective logistics network by leveraging best-in-class technology, and processes. The aim is to reduce the cost of logistics, improve the Logistics Performance Index ranking, and create a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem. NLP is being implemented through a comprehensive logistics action plan. The progress under each of these action areas is below:

## i. Integrated Digital Logistics Systems:

- Unified  Logistics  Integrated  Platform,  a  single  window  platform,  integrating  36 logistics-related digital systems/portals across eight Ministries and providing realtime information on 1,800 data fields has been developed.
- For tracking 100 per cent of India's containerised EXIM cargo, a Logistics Data Bank has been developed which uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), IoT, and Big data analytics and is integrated with 28 port terminals of India, over 95 toll plazas, 407  container  freight  station/inland  container  depot  and  empty  yards,  56  SEZs, three integrated check posts.
- ii.    Service Quality Standards: An e-book has been developed on warehousing standards delineating existing standards issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards and Warehouse Development and Regulatory Authority.
- iii.   Capacity Building: Training courses on logistics and PMGS-NMP are being integrated with central and state training institutes.
- iv.    State engagement: States are developing State Logistics Plans aligned with NLP to give policy focus at the State level. 26 States have notified their State Logistics policies. An annual 'Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS)' survey is also deployed in all State and Union Territories.
- v. EXIM Logistics: To  streamline  EXIM  logistics,  infrastructure  gaps  are  addressed through  action  plans  developed  by  the  National  Committee  on  Trade  Facilitation (NCTF). NCTF Working Groups formulated a National Trade Facilitation Action Plan 2020-23. The action plan for 2024-26 is being developed.
- vi.    Services  Improvement Framework: The Service Improvement Group has been established with the involvement of over 30 business associations. Critical issues are raised by associations on the E-LoGS platform.
- vii.    Sectoral Plans for Efficient Logistics: This aims to address the needs and challenges in the logistics sector, particularly of bulk and breakbulk cargo. Coal Logistics Plan and Policy  was  launched  in  February  2024.  Comprehensive  Port  Connectivity  Plan  was prepared in 2022 that identified 107 port projects to strengthen connectivity between ports, railways, roadways, and inland waterways.
- viii.   Facilitation  of  Development  of  Logistics  Park: Guidelines  for  Multi-Modal Logistics Park are being reviewed.
