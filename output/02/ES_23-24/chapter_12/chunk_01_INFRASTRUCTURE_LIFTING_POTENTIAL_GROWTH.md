The foremost among the responses initiated by the Union Government to overcome the pandemic-driven slowdown in the economy was increase in capital expenditure, aimed particularly at the creation of high quality physical and social infrastructure facilities.  Keeping the momentum going over the last five years, capital expenditure of  the  Government has seen an almost three-fold increase in FY24, relative to FY20 levels. The major beneficiaries of this step-up are key foundational assets like roads and railways.

The burgeoning public investment has been complemented by a host of institutional and procedural reforms that facilitated project execution and timely issue resolutions. These include  initiatives  to  enhance  private  sector  participation  through  PPPs,  facilitative measures  like  National  Infrastructure  Pipeline  and  Project  Monitoring  Group,  debottlenecking procedures PM-GatiShakti, and novel instruments such as REITS and InvITs  to  ease  the  constraints  on  long-term  finances  required  for  infrastructure investments.

The  Chapter  shows  that,  with  increased  public  investment  over  the  last  five  years, India  has  witnessed  significant  expansion  in  physical  and  digital  connectivity  and social infrastructure including sanitation and water supply helping to improve quality of life of the people. At the same time, given the fiscal compulsions and consolidation plans of the Union and the State Governments, it is important that viable projects on the  public-private  participation  mode  emerge  and  get  executed.  Regular  collection of  sector-wise,  source-wise  information  on  infrastructure  investment,  bottom-up studies and aggregation of requirements of infrastructure and periodic assessment of utilisation of assets created will help making mid-course corrections on the country's developmental path.
