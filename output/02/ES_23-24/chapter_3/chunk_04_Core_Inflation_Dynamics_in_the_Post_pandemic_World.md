# Core Inflation Dynamics in the Post-pandemic World

## CORE INFLATION DYNAMICS IN THE POST-PANDEMIC WORLD

## Core inflation hits a four-year low in FY24

3.11.  Core  inflation  is  measured  by  excluding  food  and  energy  items  from  CPI  headline inflation.  It  assesses  the  underlying  price  trends  by  largely  eliminating  the  impact  of  price volatilities arising from transitory supply shocks. The following discussion splits core inflation into its goods and services components. Core goods are further split into consumer durables and  consumer  non-durables.  The  items  and  weights  to  segregate  core  goods  and  services indices is given in Annexure 1. The breakdown of core inflation into its components is given in Chart III.11.

3.12.  From the pandemic-driven highs, inflationary pressures in India eased in FY22, aided by softening food inflation. However, core inflation had risen to 6 per cent at the same time, driven primarily by rising international commodity prices. As Chart III.12 shows, core services inflation inched up in the year, but the increase was lower than that of core consumer goods.

3.13.  Inflationary  pressures  firmed  up  in  FY23  yet  again  driven  by  the  Russia-Ukraine  war disrupting the recouping supply chains leading to a rise in food and fuel prices. As economic activity gained momentum, core inflation also increased slightly and was primarily driven by core services inflation as house rents went up, with people returning to urban areas (Chart III.15).  In  FY24, the price situation improved. CPI inflation moderated, driven by a decline in core inflation -both goods and services. Core services inflation eased to a nine-year low in FY24; at the same time, core goods inflation also declined to a four-year low.

3.14. Trends in core inflation are important in determining the contours of monetary policy. Assessing the emerging patterns of price pressures, the RBI increased the repo rate gradually by 250 basis points since May 2022 to reign inflationary pressures. Chart III.13 indicates the impact of monetary policy transmission on core inflation, which declined around 4 percentage points between April 2022 and June 2024.

## A steep decline in service prices hastens moderation in core inflation

3.15.  Stubborn  core  services  prices  are  a  risk  factor  for  the  inflation  outlook  of  advanced economies (Box III.1). In contrast, India's core services inflation reached a nine-year low in FY24. This was aided by moderation in housing rental inflation, with a significant increase in the stock of new houses in 2023 5 .

## Box III.1: Elevated risks for core services inflation in advanced economies

As per the March 2024 Quarterly Review of the Bank of International Settlements 6 , while there was a discernible retreat in the prices of food, energy and core goods following the gradual  normalisation  of  the  supply  chain  in  2023,  the  core  services  inflation  remained elevated in 2023. The review also showed that the recent pace of deceleration in core goods prices closely matches the previous cases, while at the same time, the price growth in services has been more stubborn than it was in past inflation episodes. The persistent nature of service inflation is because of the much higher labour intensity in services. Rising housing prices also contributed to this.

These dynamics have played out similarly across countries and regions but less so in Asian emerging market economies and Latin America (Chart III.16). Going ahead, the persistence in  the  inflation  of  services  has  larger  implications  for  AEs  than  for  Emerging  Market Economies (EMEs). This is because services carry a larger share in consumer price indices of AEs, posing a greater risk to their headline inflation outlook.

## Consumer durable inflation remains elevated but softens in FY24

3.16. Consumer durables inflation increased progressively between FY20 and FY23 by more than 5 percentage points. FY21 witnessed a considerable increase in gold prices, a key component of the personal care category of CPI. In FY22 and FY23, clothing, which accounts for 48 per cent of weightage in the consumer durable index, was a major driver of inflation.  The surge in the prices of key input materials used by apparel manufacturers, particularly cotton, led to this. With the improvement in the supply of key raw materials, the inflation rate for consumer durables declined in FY24. However, record-high gold prices, driven by anticipated Fed rate cuts and escalating geopolitical uncertainty, have exerted upward pressure on overall durables inflation.

## Core consumer non-durable inflation declines steeply

3.17.  Consumer  non-durables  (CND)  in  the  CPI  basket  have  three  components-food  and beverages, fuel and other consumption items (details in Annexure 1). This section examines the other core consumer non-durable components (other consumption items of CND) only. Subsequent sections will examine 'food and beverages' while 'fuel and light' has already been elaborated in paragraph 3.9. While the core CND inflation plunged in FY20, it started to inch up in FY21, reached an all-time in FY22, and declined sharply in FY23 and FY24. The underlying cause for this has mainly been changes in the cost of transport components.
