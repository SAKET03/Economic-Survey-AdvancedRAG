## FOOD INFLATION

## Food price pressures due to adverse weather conditions

3.18. Food inflation has been a global phenomenon in the last two years. Research 7   indicates the rising vulnerability of food prices to climate change - heat waves, uneven monsoon distribution, unseasonal  rainfall,  hailstorms,  torrential  rainfall  and  historic  dry  conditions  (Patra,  John &amp; George, 2024). In FY23 and FY24, the agriculture sector was affected by extreme weather events, lower reservoir levels, and damaged crops that adversely affected farm output and food prices. So, food inflation based on the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) increased from 3.8 per cent in FY22 to 6.6 per cent in FY23 and further to 7.5 per cent in FY24.

## Reasons for price pressures in major food items

3.19. The  production  prospects  of  vegetables  and  pulses  were  particularly  impacted  by unfavourable weather conditions. The increase in tomato prices in July 2023 was caused by seasonal changes in crop production, region-specific crop diseases such as white fly infestation, and the early arrival of monsoon rains in the northern part of the country. There were also logistics disruptions in isolated areas due to heavy rains. The spike in onion prices was due to several factors, including rainfall during the last harvesting season affecting the quality of rabi onions, delays in sowing during the kharif season, prolonged dry spells impacting kharif production, and trade-related measures taken by other countries.

3.20. The prices of pulses, particularly of tur, increased due to low production over the past two years, caused by adverse weather conditions. Urad production was affected by slow sowing progress in the rabi season coupled with climatic disturbances in the southern states. The area and output of gram was also lower compared to the previous rabi season.

3.21.  Since the beginning of 2023, there has been an increase in the price of milk. This is due to a decrease in artificial inseminations during the peak days of the pandemic, as well as higher costs for animal feed. The milk cooperatives increased the price of milk and milk products to account for increased costs. The milk price increase moderated by the end of FY24.

3.22. However, the government took prompt actions, including open market sales, retailing in specified outlets, and timely imports, to ensure an adequate supply of essential food items (Box III.2). Additionally, to ensure food security for the poor, the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana, which provides free food grains to more than 81 crore beneficiaries, was extended for a period of five years starting from January 2024.

## Box III.2: Administrative measures to contain food inflation in FY24

## Wheat/Atta

- Export of wheat flour, maida and semolina was placed under a prohibited category since August 2022.
- To prevent hoarding and unscrupulous speculation, stock limits were imposed on wheat from June 2023 to March 2024.
- In  November 2023, the Government introduced Bharat Atta at a subsidised price of ₹27.50 per kg to make it affordable for consumers.
- Wheat and rice are offloaded periodically from the central pool under open market sale.

## Rice/Paddy

- The  Government  placed  the  export  of  broken  rice  and  non-basmati  rice  under  the prohibited category in September 2022 and July 2023, respectively.
- To prevent the export of non-basmati rice under the garb of basmati rice, the floor price for the export of basmati rice was fixed in October 2023.
- To maintain adequate stock and to keep domestic prices under check, the Government imposed a 20 per cent export duty on parboiled rice until 31 March 2024.
- In February 2024, the Government mandated to declare the stock position of rice/paddy by traders/wholesalers, retailers, big chain retailers and processors/millers.
- In February 2024, the Government introduced Bharat Rice at a subsidised price of ₹29 per kg for selling through NAFED, NCCF and Kendriya Bhandar.

## Pulses

- Calibrated release of stocks from the buffer of pulses is being done to ensure availability and affordability to consumers.
- To augment domestic availability and moderate the prices of pulses, import of tur and urad has been kept under 'Free Category' until 31 March 2025. Basic import duty on masur was reduced to zero until 31 March 2024.
- The Government launched Bharat Dal in July 2023 to convert chana stock into chana dal for retail disposal at a highly subsidised rate. Later, the Bharat Dal was extended to include Moong Dal and Moong Sabut.
- Besides,  India  imported  considerable  quantities  of  Tur  (mainly  from  Mozambique, Myanmar, Tanzania, Sudan and Malawi), Masur (mainly from Australia, Canada and Russia) and Urad (mainly from Myanmar) in FY24.

## Onion

- The onion buffer size under PSF was increased from 1.00 LMT in FY21 to 7.00 LMT in FY24. The stock was released through retail sales, e-Nam auctions and bulk sales in wholesale markets.
- The Government placed a Minimum Export Price on specific varieties of onion from October 2023 to December 2023.
- In  December  2023,  the  export  policy  of  onions  was  amended  from  the  'free'  to  the 'prohibited' category until 31 March 2024.

## Edible Oils

- The basic duty on crude palm oil, crude soyabean oil, and crude sunflower oil was cut from 2.5 per cent to nil. The agri-cess on oil was reduced from 20 per cent to 5 per cent. In January 2024, this duty structure was extended until 31 March 2025.
- The reduced basic duty structure on refined soybean oil, refined sunflower oil and refined palm oil was extended until 31 March 2025.
- Free import of refined palm oils was extended till further orders.

## Sugar

- In  October  2023, the  Government extended the date of restrictions on the export of sugar (raw sugar, white sugar, refined sugar and organic sugar) beyond 31 October 2023 until further orders.

## Global food prices and domestic inflation

3.23. In India, the edible oil market heavily depends on imports, with more than 50 per cent of the total edible oil requirement being imported 8 , making it sensitive to global prices. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) edible oils price index fluctuation is a key indicator of these global price trends. The recent downward trend in this index is broadly correlated with the decline in domestic edible oil prices in India. As a result, the Government closely monitors global market trends to ensure the availability of edible oils for consumers at an affordable price. Efforts are also made to balance imports with domestic production to mitigate the risks associated with global price volatility. In this context, the National Mission on Edible Oils - Oil Palm aims to increase domestic crude palm oil production to reduce the import burden.

3.24.  In the case of sugar, the Government announced restrictions on export in June 2022 to ensure sufficient local supplies and thereby manage sugar inflation. These export restrictions have indeed played a role in stabilising domestic sugar prices. As a result, even though the global sugar price index inflated and has been showing volatility since February 2023, domestic sugar prices have remained much less volatile.
