## DOMESTIC RETAIL INFLATION

## Retail inflation moderated gradually in FY24

3.7. Since  2020,  countries  have  been  facing  challenges  in  controlling  inflation.  In  FY23, Consumer Price Index (CPI) based retail inflation in India was primarily influenced by higher food inflation, while core inflation remained moderate. Externally, the Russia-Ukraine war led to price pressures, while domestically, excessive heat in the summer and uneven rainfall put pressure on food prices.

3.8. However, since May 2022, monetary policy broadly focused on absorbing excess liquidity in the system by increasing the policy repo rate by 250 basis points from 4 per cent in May 2022 to 6.5 per cent in February 2023. Thereafter, the policy rate was kept unchanged by focusing on the gradual withdrawal of accommodation, aiming to align inflation with the target, while simultaneously fostering growth. Consequently, the persistent and sticky core inflation observed in FY23 declined to 3.1 per cent in June 2024.

3.9. As the global energy price index experienced a sharp decline in FY24, retail fuel inflation also stayed low. The Central Government's announcement of price cuts for LPG, petrol, and diesel led to lower LPG and petroleum product inflation. In August 2023, the price of a domestic LPG cylinder was reduced by ₹200 per cylinder in all markets across the country. As a result, LPG inflation rate has been in the deflationary zone since September 2023. Again in March 2024, the price of non-subsidised LPG cylinders was reduced by ₹100 per cylinder. Similarly, in March 2024, the Central Government lowered the prices of petrol and diesel by ₹2 per litre. Subsequently, retail inflation in petrol and diesel used in vehicles moved to the deflationary zone in March 2024. Additionally, global commodity prices declined in 2023, reducing price pressure  in  energy,  metals,  minerals,  and  agricultural  commodities  through  the  imported inflation  channel.  Low  fuel  and  core  inflation  ensured  a  downward  trajectory  for  headline inflation, despite volatility in food prices in FY24.

3.10. Thus, moderation in inflation was largely the result of prudent administrative measures and monetary policies implemented during the post-pandemic economic recovery phase. As per the recent data released by MoSPI, the retail inflation rate was 5.1 per cent in June 2024. In view of this, the following section examines the detailed trends and patterns in core and food inflation.
