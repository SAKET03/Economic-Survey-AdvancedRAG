## Interstate variations in inflation are more pronounced in rural areas

3.26. The rural consumption basket has a much higher weightage of food items (47.3%) than the  urban (29.6%). Hence, in the last two years, States that witnessed elevated food prices also experienced higher rural inflation. It is also found that the inter-state variation calculated through standard deviation is higher in rural than urban inflation. Besides, States with higher overall inflation also tend to exhibit a wider rural-to-urban inflation gap, with rural inflation

exceeding urban inflation. A scatter plot of overall inflation for different States against their rural-to-urban inflation ratio reveals a positive correlation. For instance, the difference between rural and urban inflation in Haryana was much wider compared with Goa, which had relatively lower inflation.
