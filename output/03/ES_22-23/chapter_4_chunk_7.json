  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nThe year 2022 marked the return of high inflation, especially in advanced economies, after nearly four decades. Inflation did not spare emerging economies either. Major central banks implemented sharp increases in policy rates, with the Federal Reserve's rate hikes being the steepest since the 1970s. The RBI initiated its monetary tightening cycle in April 2022 and has since implemented a policy repo rate hike of 225 basis points. Consequently, domestic financial conditions began to tighten, reflected in the lower growth of monetary aggregates. The change in RBI's policy stance in FY23 led to a moderation of surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed during the pandemic years. Monetary policy transmission is well underway as lending and deposit rates increased following the hike in policy rates. In the government securities (G-sec) market, bond yields were on an upward trajectory until June 2022 and moderated in November and December 2022. The global tightening cycle contributed to a dampened global outlook, but the domestic appetite for credit has been on an upswing. Non-food credit offtake by scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) has been growing in double digits since April 2022. Credit disbursed by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) has also been on the rise. The balance sheet clean-up exercise has been vital in enhancing the lending ability of financial institutions. The Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.0%, while the Capital-to-Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) remains healthy at 16.0%. The health of NBFCs has continued to improve as well. Political and economic developments in 2022 led to increased volatility in capital markets around the world. However, domestic capital markets displayed some encouraging trends. The primary equity markets witnessed participation from all segments, especially with increased Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contributions. The secondary capital market indices performed better than their peers between April and December 2022. Net FPI flows turned positive in the quarter ending December 2022. The indices have displayed a decreasing trend in volatility as measured by the India Volatility Index (VIX) over this period. Insurance penetration in India has been steadily increasing, with life insurance penetration being above the emerging markets and global averages. India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. The pension sector has also been taking rapid strides since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The sector has witnessed a robust increase in the number of subscribers and assets under management (AuM). As global central banks reaffirm their hawkish stances and telegraph 'higher-for-longer' policy rates, monetary conditions are expected to remain tight worldwide. Domestically, RBI's support to growth will ensure adequate liquidity in financial markets. The growth in credit offtake is expected to sustain, and combined with a pick-up in private Capex, will usher in a virtuous investment cycle.\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Progress Made Under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code\n\n## Progress made under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code\n\n## ease of doing business: facilitating the process of 'exit'\n\n4.25  The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has facilitated the exit of distressed firms, thereby allocating scarce economic resources towards more productive use. Since the inception of the IBC in December 2016, 5,893 Corporate Insolvency Resolution Processes (CIRPs) had commenced by end-September 2022, of which 67 per cent have been closed. Of these, around 21 per cent were closed on appeal or review or settled, 19 per cent were withdrawn, 46 per cent ended in orders for liquidation, and 14 per cent culminated in the approval of resolution plans. The Code also provides for a Corporate Debtor (CD) to voluntarily liquidate itself subject to the fulfilment of certain conditions as prescribed under the Code. 1,351 corporate persons initiated voluntary liquidation under the Code as of end-September 2022.\n\nfigure iV.16: cirPs status since inception (as on September 2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: IBBI (Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India)\n\n4.26  Sectoral analysis reveals that 52 per cent of the ongoing CIRPs belong to industry, followed by 37 per cent in the services sector by September 2022. Further, within the industry, 74 per cent of the initiated CIRPs was from the manufacturing sector. Of these, the textile, basic metals and food sectors accounted for 48 per cent of the ongoing CIRPs. While in the services sector,\n\n60 per cent of the ongoing CIRPs belongs to real estate, renting and business activities.\n\nfigure iV.17: Sector-wise status of cirPs (as on September 2022)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: IBBI\n\nFigure IV.18: Sectoral break up of ongoing CIRPs in Manufacturing Sector\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: IBBI\n\nFigure IV.19: Sectoral break up of ongoing CIRPs in Services Sector\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: IBBI\n\n## Behavioural change: recoding Business relationships\n\n4.27  One of the far-reaching spill-over effects of the Code has been the behavioural change effectuated by it among debtors. The fear of losing control over the CD upon initiation of CIRP has nudged thousands of debtors to settle their dues even before the initiation of insolvency proceedings.  Until  September  30  2022,  23,417  applications  for  initiation  of  CIRPs  of  CDs having underlying default of ₹7.3 lakh crore were disposed of before their admission into CIRP.\n\n## 69 per cent of the distressed assets rescued, realisation value around 178 per cent of the liquidation value\n\n4.28  Until September 30, 2022, 553 CIRPs have ended in resolution. Despite the very low value of the distressed firms to begin with, 69 per cent of distressed assets were rescued by the Code. Overall, in terms of value realisation for initiators of CIRPs (which includes Financial Creditors, Operational Creditors and Corporate Debtors), the resolution plans realised ₹2.4 lakh crore, which is 177.6 per cent of the liquidation value and 84 1 per cent of the fair value of the 553 CDs rescued. Moreover, realisation by financial creditors under resolution plans in comparison to liquidation value was 201 per cent, while the realisation by them was 33 per cent of their claims.\n\n## 92 per cent of the value realised under the liquidation Process\n\n4.29  1807 CDs ended up with orders for liquidation as of September 2022. These CDs assets were valued at less than 8 per cent of the aggregate claim amount on the ground. However, more than 76 per cent of the CIRPs ending in liquidation (1349 out of 1774 for which data are available) were earlier with the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) and/ or are defunct. The economic value of most of the corporate debtors that ended in liquidation had almost completely eroded even before they were admitted into CIRP. 429 CDs have been completely liquidated. The Code has facilitated the realisation of 92 per cent of the value through the liquidation of these companies.\n\nTable IV.4: Rescue of distressed assets as on 30th September  (Amount in ₹ crore)\n\n| rescue of distressed assets               | companies rescued by resolution   | companies ordered for liquidation   | total     |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------|\n| No. of Companies                          | 553                               | 1807                                | 2360      |\n| Aggregate Claims                          | 7,90,626                          | 8,28,180                            | 16,18,806 |\n| Liquidation Value                         | 1,37,119                          | 60,143                              | 1,97,261  |\n| Assets available as %of                   | 17.3                              | 7.3                                 | 12.19     |\n| Resolution Value                          | 2,43,452                          | NA                                  | 2,43,452  |\n| Resolution Value as %of Liquidation Value | 177.6                             | NA                                  | NA        |\n| Resolution Value as %of Aggregate Claims  | 30.8                              | NA                                  | NA        |\n| Average time taken                        | 561 days                          | 437 days                            | NA        |\n| Cost %of Resolution Value                 | 0.6                               | NA                                  | NA        |\n\nSource: IBBI\n\n1  Based on 456 cases where fair values have been estimated\n\n## NPAs: IBC recovers highest amount for Scheduled Commercial Banks\n\n4.30  As per the RBI data, in FY 22, the total amount recovered by SCBs under IBC has been the highest compared to other channels such as Lok Adalat's, SARFAESI Act and DRTs in this period.\n\n4.31  In  a  public  auction-based  resolution  model 2 such  as  the  IBC,  the  extent  of  the  haircut represents the discount the market demands for acquiring the stressed entity as a going concern. Since significant value destruction may have already happened in these assets, a comparison of realised value with admitted claims may not be a reasonable indicator of the effectiveness of the resolution process. Further, the rate of recovery is contingent on several factors, including the overall macroeconomic environment, perceived growth prospects of the entity and its sector, and the extent of erosion in the intrinsic value of the entity. As a broad-based recovery gains traction, these factors are likely to turn favourable for financial resolution 3 .\n\nTable IV.5: Amount recovered by SCBs through various channels (Amount in ₹ crore)\n\n| recovery channel   | amount recovered during the year*   | amount recovered during the year*   | amount recovered during the year*   | amount recovered during the year*   | amount recovered during the year*   |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| recovery channel   | 2017-18                             | 2018-19                             | 2019-20                             | 2020-21                             | 2021-22(P)                          |\n| Lok Adalats        | 1,811                               | 2,750                               | 4,211                               | 1,119                               | 2,777                               |\n| DRTs               | 7,235                               | 10,552                              | 9,986                               | 8,113                               | 12,114                              |\n| SARFAESI Act       | 26,380                              | 38,905                              | 34,283                              | 27,686                              | 27,349                              |\n| IBC                | 4,926                               | 66,440                              | 1,04,117                            | 27,311                              | 47,421                              |\n| total              | 40,352                              | 1,18,647                            | 1,52,597                            | 64,229                              | 89,661                              |\n\nSource: Off-site returns, RBI and IBBI\n\n- Note: P: Provisional, DRTs stand for Debt Recovery Tribunals\n- *: Refers to the amount recovered during the given year, which could be with reference to the cases referred during the given year as well as during the earlier years.",
