See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Indian industry sector contributes about 30% of the country's total gross value added (GVA) and has shown resilience in the face of global headwinds. In FY23, the industry faced challenges due to the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which led to a sharp rise in commodity prices. Despite this, the sector showed a modest growth of 4.1% in FY23, compared to 10.3% in FY22. The growth in industrial income has kept pace with overall GVA growth, with manufacturing GVA growing at a higher rate.\\n\\nThe industry sector provides employment to over 12.1 crore people and has direct and indirect linkages with other sectors, contributing to economic growth and employment. Industrial growth has multiplier effects, leading to employment growth, and some industries like textiles and construction have high employment elasticities.\\n\\nThe survey reviews the performance of the Indian industry in FY23, exploring demand stimulants to industrial growth, supply response, trends in credit to the industry, and foreign investment. The chapter also addresses developments in key sub-industries and their challenges.\\n\\nThe industry sector's growth is driven by robust domestic conditions, strong export performance, and increased investment demand. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23 was the highest since FY15. Exports of goods and services as a share of GDP have been the highest since FY16.\\n\\nThe increase in investment demand has emerged as a powerful stimulus to industrial growth, triggered by the augmented capex of the central government. The growth of eight core industries, including coal, fertilizers, cement, electricity, steel, and refinery products, has held steady, reflecting a broad momentum in industrial activity.\\n\\nThe electronics industry continues to ascend in importance, with India becoming the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer globally. The Indian pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticals industry, ranking 3rd worldwide in production by volume and 14th by value.\\n\\nThe government's Make-in-India initiative has facilitated investment, fostered innovation, and built world-class infrastructure. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes across 14 categories have further complemented it, with an estimated Capex of around â‚¹3 lakh crore over the next five years and the potential to generate over 60 lakh jobs.\\n\\nThe industry sector's growth has been supported by an upswing in bank credit, with credit to industry growing in double digits since July 2022. Credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase, assisted by the introduction of the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS).\\n\\nThe survey highlights the importance of the industry sector in the Indian economy and its potential to become a global manufacturing hub. The sector's growth is expected to be driven by strong domestic demand, investment revival, and export growth. However, the sector also faces challenges, including input cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and global economic uncertainty.\\n\\nThe government has implemented several measures to support the industry sector, including the PLI schemes, the Make-in-India initiative, and the ECLGS. The sector is expected to play a critical role in India's economic growth and its ambitions to become a key player in global value chains.\\n\\nThe Indian economy has made significant strides in internet penetration, which is a key requisite of Industry 4.0. The government is cognizant of the importance of Industry 4.0 in achieving the goals of Aatmanirbharta and its ambitions of becoming a key player in global value chains.\\n\\nThe Global Innovation Index (GII) ranks countries based on innovation performance, and India entered the top 40 innovating countries for the first time in 2022. India became the most innovative nation in the lower-middle-income group, overtaking Vietnam and leading the Central and Southern Asia region.\\n\\nThe 'Make in India' initiative has been striving to ensure that the business ecosystem in the nation is conducive for investors doing business in India. The reform measures include amendments to laws and liberalization of guidelines and regulations to reduce compliance burdens.\\n\\nThe DPIIT's Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2020 shows that 7,496 reforms were implemented across States and UTs, enhancing the Ease of Doing Business. Ministries and States/UTs have reduced more than 39,000 compliances, and over 3,500 provisions related to minor technical or procedural defaults have been decriminalized.\\n\\nThe National Single Window System (NSWS) was soft-launched in September 2021 to improve the ease of doing business by providing a single digital platform to investors for approvals and clearances. The portal has integrated multiple existing clearance systems of various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments.\\n\\nThe government's efforts towards fostering innovation include incubation, handholding, funding, industry-academia partnership, and mentorship. The government has strengthened its IPR regime by modernizing the IP office, reducing legal compliances, and facilitating IP filing for start-ups, women entrepreneurs, small industries, and others.\\n\\nThe start-up ecosystem in India has grown significantly, with over 48% of start-ups from Tier II & III cities. The government has given a major boost to start-ups through various initiatives, including the Start-up India Initiative, eligible companies getting recognized as Start-ups by DPIIT to access tax benefits, easier compliance, and IPR fast-tracking.\\n\\nThe 'Flipping' phenomenon, where Indian start-ups get headquartered overseas, has been observed, but the government has taken measures to encourage 'Reverse Flipping'. The measures include simplifying the process for grant of 'Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB) certification' for Start-ups, further simplification of taxation of Employee Stock Options (ESOPs), and simplifying multiple layers of tax and uncertainty due to tax litigation.\\n\\nOverall, the Indian industry sector has shown resilience and growth, driven by strong domestic demand, investment revival, and export growth. The sector is expected to play a critical role in India's economic growth and its ambitions to become a key player in global value chains.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Resilient FDI Inflow in Manufacturing Sector\n\n## Resilient FDI inflow in Manufacturing Sector\n\n9.15 Annual FDI equity inflows in the manufacturing sector have been steadily increasing over the last few years. It jumped from US$ 12.1 billion in FY21 to US$ 21.3 billion in FY22 as the pandemic-driven expansionary policies of advanced economies led to a surge in global\n\nliquidity. With the rise in global uncertainty in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, FDI equity inflow in manufacturing in the first half of FY23 fell below its corresponding level in the first half of FY22. The monetary tightening at the global level has further restricted the FDI equity inflows. A rebound in FDI inflows is, however, expected as the Indian economy sustains its high growth while monetary tightening the world over eventually eases with the weakening of inflationary pressures.\n\nFigure IX.8: Sector-wise FDI equity Inflows in 2022-23 during april-September 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: DPIIT data\n\n9.16 Notwithstanding an overall drop in FDI in the first half of FY23, inflows have stayed above the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving the ease of doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world. The government has implemented an investor-friendly FDI policy under which FDI up to 100 per cent is permitted through automatic route in most sectors. India continues to open up its sectors to global investors by raising FDI limits, removing regulatory barriers, developing infrastructure, and improving the business environment.\n\n## Box IX.2: FDI Policy Reforms to bolster Investment\n\n- India continues to open up its sectors to global investors by raising FDI limits and removing regulatory barriers to attracting increased investments, in addition to developing infrastructure and improving the business environment. To make India a more attractive investment destination, the Government has implemented several radical and transformative FDI reforms across sectors such as Defence, Pension, e-commerce activities etc.\n- In FY20, 100 per cent FDI under automatic route was permitted for the sale of coal, and coal mining activities, including associated processing infrastructure, subject to provisions of relevant acts. 26 per cent FDI under the government route has been permitted for uploading/ streaming of  News  &amp;  Current Affairs  through  Digital  Media.  100  per  cent  FDI  has  been  permitted  in Intermediaries  or  Insurance  Intermediaries , including  insurance  brokers,  reinsurance  brokers, insurance consultants, corporate agents, third-party administrators, Surveyors and Loss Assessors and such other entities as may be notified by the Insurance Regulatory and Development  Authority from time to time.\n\n- To curb opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the government amended the FDI policy, according to which an entity of a country which shares a land border with India or where the beneficial owner of investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route. Further, in the event of the transfer of ownership of any existing or future FDI in an entity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the restriction/purview of the said policy amendment, such subsequent change in beneficial ownership will also require government approval.\n- To simplify the approval process of foreign Investment and to promote ease of doing business, the erstwhile Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) was abolished in May 2017, and a new regime has been put in place. Under the new regime, the process for granting FDI approvals has been simplified, wherein the work relating to the processing of applications for FDI has been delegated to the concerned Ministries/ Departments, and DPIIT is the nodal department for facilitating the process.\n- A revamped portal, 'Foreign Investment Facilitation Portal (FIF Portal)', has been launched as the online single-point interface of the Government of India for investors to facilitate Foreign Direct  Investment.  The  portal  facilitates  single  window  clearance  of  applications  which  are through the government approval route. The FIF Portal has been integrated with the National Single Window System (NSWS).",
