See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"Climate change is primarily attributed to disproportionately high cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from developed countries. India has contributed only about 4% to cumulative global emissions and maintains its per capita emission at far less than the world average. Despite being less responsible for emissions, India is committed to a low-emission growth pathway with a net-zero emissions goal by 2070.\\n\\nIndia has integrated development goals with ambitious climate action goals, including increasing solar power capacity, energy saving targets, and improving green cover. The country has achieved its target of 40% installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuels ahead of 2030 and has advanced the target to 50%. The National Hydrogen Mission and Green Hydrogen Policy have been introduced to enable India to be energy independent by 2047.\\n\\nThe country has updated its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in line with the Prime Minister's vision, focusing on sustainable lifestyles and climate justice. India aims to reduce its emissions intensity by 45% by 2030 and achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources.\\n\\nIndia's climate actions have been largely financed from domestic sources, but the country needs tens of trillions of US dollars to achieve its climate goals. The government has scaled up efforts to mobilize private capital, including through sovereign green bonds. A framework for green bonds has been issued, complying with International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles.\\n\\nThe country's climate vision is linked to its development goals, including poverty eradication and basic well-being for all citizens. India launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008, establishing eight National Missions. The country has made significant progress on these missions, including increasing solar power capacity and improving energy efficiency.\\n\\nIndia's updated NDC includes eight goals, three of which are quantitative targets to be achieved by 2030. The targets include cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources reaching 40%, reduction in emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35%, and creation of additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\\n\\nThe country aims to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. India's forest and tree cover have shown a steady increase, with a carbon stock of 7,204 million tonnes in 2019. The country has 75 Ramsar sites covering 13.3 lakh ha and has increased its mangrove cover by 364 sq. km.\\n\\nIndia has implemented various measures to conserve and protect the environment, including the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The country has also launched initiatives such as Project Cheetah, the world's first intercontinental large wild carnivore translocation project.\\n\\nIndia has committed to mitigating pollution caused by littered single-use plastics and has banned the manufacture, import, and use of identified single-use plastic items. The country has also notified guidelines on Extended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging and has implemented the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021.\\n\\nThe government has published the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, and the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, to ensure environmentally sound management of waste batteries and e-waste. India aims to promote a circular economy, reduce plastic footprint, and develop new alternatives to plastic packaging.\\n\\nThe country has made significant progress on its climate goals, including enhancing its non-fossil fuel-based installed capacity target to 50%. India has also evolved its sustainable finance framework, extending the requirement to 1,000 top listed companies on a mandatory basis. The country needs to dedicate resources to climate change, in addition to its development goals. Obligations on climate should be matched with on-time availability of climate finance, technology, and inputs like critical minerals.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 8 Content:\n# Conclusion\n\n## Conclusion\n\n7.85  India  is  spearheading  one  of  the  world's  most  ambitious  clean  energy  transitions  and remains steadfast in its commitment to combating climate change. Despite the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on the economy, India has enhanced its climate ambition manifold and embarked on a long-term strategy towards a Low GHG Emission Development Strategy by adopting a multi-pronged approach.\n\n- 7.86  The energy transition plan is complemented by numerous policies intended to improve the ecosystem to deploy promising technological innovations, like green hydrogen. The country has consistently modified/amended regulatory standards and adopted policy-level interventions to support the development and adoption of new technology. India's progress on energy transition may be understood from the fact that it has enhanced its non-fossil fuel based installed capacity target  to  50  per  cent  in  its  updated  NDC  as  the  target  of  40  per  cent  of  the  first  NDC  was achieved well in advance.\n\n7.87  The sustainable finance framework has also evolved from the initial steps covering the top listed 100 companies required to conform to sustainability standards. The requirement has now not only been extended to 1000 top listed companies on a mandatory basis but also the sustainability standards have become much stronger and measurable that correspond to the best practices while taking into account the specific context of India.\n\n7.88  As mentioned earlier, resources have competing use, and development strategies are not substitutable. Modification in the development pathway has a transition cost, including social and economic costs.  India's climate ambitions require resources to be dedicated to the cause of climate change, in addition to, what is needed for the country's development goals. Obligations on climate should be matched with the on-time availability of climate finance, technology, and inputs like critical minerals, while not jeopardising the socio-economic development objectives and aspirations.\n\n7.89  Even if India has so far undertaken climate actions on its own, the heightened expectations of  further  large-scale  climate  measures  have  to  be  equated  with  the  enhanced  initiatives  by developed  countries  in  terms  of  providing  means  of  implementation,  including  finance, technology transfer, and capacity-building support.\n\n- 7.90  More importantly, the global climate agenda will advance if advanced countries can set examples of policy and behavioural changes that work in their backyard and whose trade-offs are well recognised and accepted by their people. Then, it might be realistic to expect such policies and behavioural expectations of households to succeed in developing countries with suitable adaptation.",
