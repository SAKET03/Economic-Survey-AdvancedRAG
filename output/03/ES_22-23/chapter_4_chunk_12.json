Major central banks implemented sharp increases in policy rates, with the Federal Reserve's rate hikes being the steepest since the 1970s. The RBI initiated its monetary tightening cycle in April 2022 and has since implemented a policy repo rate hike of 225 basis points. Consequently, domestic financial conditions began to tighten, reflected in the lower growth of monetary aggregates. The change in RBI's policy stance in FY23 led to a moderation of surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed during the pandemic years. Monetary policy transmission is well underway as lending and deposit rates increased following the hike in policy rates. In the government securities (G-sec) market, bond yields were on an upward trajectory until June 2022 and moderated in November and December 2022. The global tightening cycle contributed to a dampened global outlook, but the domestic appetite for credit has been on an upswing. Non-food credit offtake by scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) has been growing in double digits since April 2022. Credit disbursed by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) has also been on the rise. The balance sheet clean-up exercise has been vital in enhancing the lending ability of financial institutions. The Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.0%, while the Capital-to-Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) remains healthy at 16.0%. The health of NBFCs has continued to improve as well. Political and economic developments in 2022 led to increased volatility in capital markets around the world. However, domestic capital markets displayed some encouraging trends. The primary equity markets witnessed participation from all segments, especially with increased Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contributions. The secondary capital market indices performed better than their peers between April and December 2022. Net FPI flows turned positive in the quarter ending December 2022. The indices have displayed a decreasing trend in volatility as measured by the India Volatility Index (VIX) over this period. Insurance penetration in India has been steadily increasing, with life insurance penetration being above the emerging markets and global averages. India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. The pension sector has also been taking rapid strides since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The sector has witnessed a robust increase in the number of subscribers and assets under management (AuM). As global central banks reaffirm their hawkish stances and telegraph 'higher-for-longer' policy rates, monetary conditions are expected to remain tight worldwide. Domestically, RBI's support to growth will ensure adequate liquidity in financial markets. The growth in credit offtake is expected to sustain, and combined with a pick-up in private Capex, will usher in a virtuous investment cycle.\n\nSubchapter 12 Content:\n# Outlook\n\n## Outlook\n\n4.72  The resilience of the domestic financial system is reflected in the healthy balance sheet of banks, stronger capital levels of NBFCs and robust growth in the AuM of domestic mutual funds. Buoyant demand for bank credit and early signs of a revival in the investment cycle are benefiting from improving asset quality, a return to profitability and resilient capital and liquidity buffers. Further, IBC mechanism continues to support the 'Ease of Doing Business' in India by facilitating easy exit with time bound resolutions for firms. These strengths are helping the financial system absorb external spillovers, tightening global financial conditions and high volatility in financial markets.\n\n4.73  India  is  one  of  the  fastest-growing  insurance  markets  in  the  world  and  is  expected  to emerge  as  one  of  the  top  six  insurance  markets  by  2032.  Digitisation  of  India's  insurance market, accompanied by an increase in FDI limit for insurance companies, is likely to facilitate an increased flow of long-term capital, a global technology, processes, and international best practices,  which  will  support  the  growth  of  India's  insurance  sector. Also,  as  we  transition to  a  high  middle-income economy, India's pension sector has tremendous scope for growth. Government initiatives towards enhancing pension literacy of subscribers and intermediaries, and a nudge from the regulator and the government to encourage young adults to join the pension scheme would play a significant role in enhancing pension availability to a more extensive section of society.",
