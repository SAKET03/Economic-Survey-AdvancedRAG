See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Indian industry sector contributes about 30% of the country's total gross value added (GVA) and has shown resilience in the face of global headwinds. In FY23, the industry faced challenges due to the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which led to a sharp rise in commodity prices. Despite this, the sector showed a modest growth of 4.1% in FY23, compared to 10.3% in FY22. The growth in industrial income has kept pace with overall GVA growth, with manufacturing GVA growing at a higher rate.\\n\\nThe industry sector provides employment to over 12.1 crore people and has direct and indirect linkages with other sectors, contributing to economic growth and employment. Industrial growth has multiplier effects, leading to employment growth, and some industries like textiles and construction have high employment elasticities.\\n\\nThe survey reviews the performance of the Indian industry in FY23, exploring demand stimulants to industrial growth, supply response, trends in credit to the industry, and foreign investment. The chapter also addresses developments in key sub-industries and their challenges.\\n\\nThe industry sector's growth is driven by robust domestic conditions, strong export performance, and increased investment demand. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23 was the highest since FY15. Exports of goods and services as a share of GDP have been the highest since FY16.\\n\\nThe increase in investment demand has emerged as a powerful stimulus to industrial growth, triggered by the augmented capex of the central government. The growth of eight core industries, including coal, fertilizers, cement, electricity, steel, and refinery products, has held steady, reflecting a broad momentum in industrial activity.\\n\\nThe electronics industry continues to ascend in importance, with India becoming the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer globally. The Indian pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticals industry, ranking 3rd worldwide in production by volume and 14th by value.\\n\\nThe government's Make-in-India initiative has facilitated investment, fostered innovation, and built world-class infrastructure. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes across 14 categories have further complemented it, with an estimated Capex of around â‚¹3 lakh crore over the next five years and the potential to generate over 60 lakh jobs.\\n\\nThe industry sector's growth has been supported by an upswing in bank credit, with credit to industry growing in double digits since July 2022. Credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase, assisted by the introduction of the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS).\\n\\nThe survey highlights the importance of the industry sector in the Indian economy and its potential to become a global manufacturing hub. The sector's growth is expected to be driven by strong domestic demand, investment revival, and export growth. However, the sector also faces challenges, including input cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and global economic uncertainty.\\n\\nThe government has implemented several measures to support the industry sector, including the PLI schemes, the Make-in-India initiative, and the ECLGS. The sector is expected to play a critical role in India's economic growth and its ambitions to become a key player in global value chains.\\n\\nThe Indian economy has made significant strides in internet penetration, which is a key requisite of Industry 4.0. The government is cognizant of the importance of Industry 4.0 in achieving the goals of Aatmanirbharta and its ambitions of becoming a key player in global value chains.\\n\\nThe Global Innovation Index (GII) ranks countries based on innovation performance, and India entered the top 40 innovating countries for the first time in 2022. India became the most innovative nation in the lower-middle-income group, overtaking Vietnam and leading the Central and Southern Asia region.\\n\\nThe 'Make in India' initiative has been striving to ensure that the business ecosystem in the nation is conducive for investors doing business in India. The reform measures include amendments to laws and liberalization of guidelines and regulations to reduce compliance burdens.\\n\\nThe DPIIT's Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2020 shows that 7,496 reforms were implemented across States and UTs, enhancing the Ease of Doing Business. Ministries and States/UTs have reduced more than 39,000 compliances, and over 3,500 provisions related to minor technical or procedural defaults have been decriminalized.\\n\\nThe National Single Window System (NSWS) was soft-launched in September 2021 to improve the ease of doing business by providing a single digital platform to investors for approvals and clearances. The portal has integrated multiple existing clearance systems of various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments.\\n\\nThe government's efforts towards fostering innovation include incubation, handholding, funding, industry-academia partnership, and mentorship. The government has strengthened its IPR regime by modernizing the IP office, reducing legal compliances, and facilitating IP filing for start-ups, women entrepreneurs, small industries, and others.\\n\\nThe start-up ecosystem in India has grown significantly, with over 48% of start-ups from Tier II & III cities. The government has given a major boost to start-ups through various initiatives, including the Start-up India Initiative, eligible companies getting recognized as Start-ups by DPIIT to access tax benefits, easier compliance, and IPR fast-tracking.\\n\\nThe 'Flipping' phenomenon, where Indian start-ups get headquartered overseas, has been observed, but the government has taken measures to encourage 'Reverse Flipping'. The measures include simplifying the process for grant of 'Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB) certification' for Start-ups, further simplification of taxation of Employee Stock Options (ESOPs), and simplifying multiple layers of tax and uncertainty due to tax litigation.\\n\\nOverall, the Indian industry sector has shown resilience and growth, driven by strong domestic demand, investment revival, and export growth. The sector is expected to play a critical role in India's economic growth and its ambitions to become a key player in global value chains.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Robust Growth in Bank Credit to Industry\n\n## Robust Growth in Bank credit to Industry\n\n9.13 Growth in bank credit  has  kept  pace  with  industrial  growth,  with  a  sequential  surge evident  since  January  2022. While  a  large  share  of  bank  credit  continues  to  be  assigned  to large industries, credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase in part assisted by the introduction of the ECLGS, which supports around 1.2 crore businesses of which 95 per cent are MSMEs 1 . The impact of ECLGS on increasing the growth of credit to MSME was felt most during the pandemic impacted years of 2020 and 2021. It continued in 2022 as the scheme was extended to March 2023. Furthermore, growth in credit to MSME was buttressed by rebounding consumption levels, particularly in the services sector. Consequently, the share of MSMEs in gross credit offtake to the industry rose from 17.7 per cent in January 2020 to 23.7 per cent in November 2022. While the growth in total credit has been driven by an increase in credit demanded by MSMEs, large industries have also begun to increase the pace of their credit offtake since the beginning of FY23. With the spread between corporate bond yields and marginal costs of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) narrowing, and the volatility in the corporate bond market remaining high, corporates appear to be shifting their sources of financing from bond markets to  bank  capital,  where  rates  have  remained  stable  and  predictable.  Robust  growth  in  credit demand combined with rising capacity utilisation and investment in manufacturing underscores businesses' optimism regarding future demand.\n\nFigure IX.7: Double-digit credit growth in Industry driven by MSMes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI\n\n1 As per the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd.
