See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"India's external sector has faced challenges due to global commodity prices, tightening international financial conditions, and a looming global growth slowdown. However, it has been able to navigate these headwinds due to strong macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers. During FY23, India's exports have shown resilience, with petroleum products, gems & jewelry, organic & inorganic chemicals, drugs & pharmaceuticals being the leading export items. The slowdown in Indian exports is inevitable in a slowing global economy characterized by slowing global trade.\\n\\nTo nurture the inherent comparative advantage that Indian exports embody, various export promotion measures are being considered/implemented. These measures would include the National Logistics Policy, which would ease domestic frictions to encourage Indian exports by reducing the cost of internal logistics. The latest Free Trade Agreements, such as with UAE and Australia, would address external frictions by creating opportunities for exports at concessional tariffs and non-tariff barriers.\\n\\nIndia's balance of payments (BoP) encountered pressures during the year under review, with the Current Account Deficit (CAD) widening due to a sharp rise in oil prices. However, the expected easing of crude oil prices, resilience of net services exports, and buoyant inward remittances would result in a lower CAD during the remainder of FY23. India's external sector has fortified shock absorbers, including forex reserves of $562.72 billion, which can cover 9.3 months of imports, and a sustainable external debt-to-GDP ratio of 19.2%.\\n\\nThe global economy has experienced two major shocks: the 2007-08 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had a contrasting impact on the global economy, with economic growth declining to -3.8% in 2020. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has further amplified the situation, leading to a rise in inflation rates.\\n\\nIndia's trade performance has been resilient, with merchandise exports reaching an all-time high of $422 billion in FY22. However, the growth momentum has moderated in 2022 due to global headwinds. Non-petroleum and non-gems & jewelry exports have sustained their growth momentum, with notable growth in drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronic goods, engineering goods, and organic and inorganic chemicals.\\n\\nIndia's merchandise trade deficit for April-December 2022 was estimated at $218.9 billion. The services sector has been a bright spot, with exports standing at $254.5 billion in FY22, registering a growth of 23.5% over FY21. Software and business services constitute more than 60% of India's total services exports.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports/imports in Indian Rupees (INR) to promote the growth of global trade with emphasis on exports from India. The framework involves invoicing of exports and imports in INR, market-determined exchange rates, and settlement through special Rupee Vostro accounts.\\n\\nIndia's current account balance (CAB) recorded a deficit of $36.4 billion (4.4% of GDP) in Q2FY23. The widening of the CAB was mainly due to a higher merchandise trade deficit and an increase in net investment income outgo. Net services receipts increased from $51.4 billion in H1FY22 to $65.5 billion in H1FY23, primarily due to robust computer and business services receipts.\\n\\nRemittances are the second-largest major source of external financing after service exports, contributing to narrowing the CAD. India has the largest emigrant population and is the top remittance recipient country, with remittances anticipated to reach a milestone of $100 billion in 2022.\\n\\nForeign investment, consisting of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), is the largest component of the capital account. Net FDI inflows at $20.0 billion in H1FY23 were comparable with $20.3 billion in H1FY22. However, FPI flows turned negative in Q1FY23, leading to a net outflow of $14.6 billion.\\n\\nIndia's external debt, at $610.5 billion as of end-September 2022, grew by 1.3% over $602.9 billion as of end-September 2021. However, external debt as a ratio to GDP fell to 19.2% as of end-September 2022 from 20.3% a year ago. India's external debt vulnerability indicators continued to be benign, with external debt as a ratio to GDP at 19.2% and the debt service ratio at 5.0%.\\n\\nThe exchange rate of the Indian Rupee is market-determined, with the RBI intervening mainly to contain excessive volatility. On a financial year basis, the INR depreciated against the US$ by 8.3% from April to December 2022. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) of the US dollar appreciated by 7.8% in the calendar year 2022, while the NEER of India depreciated by 4.8%.\\n\\nThe international investment position (IIP) shows that Indian residents' overseas financial assets at $847.5 billion were lower by $73.0 billion or 7.9% compared to the level as of end-March 2022. India's net IIP position was valued at $389.6 billion as of end-September 2022, increasing by $31.4 billion over the level as of end-March 2022.\\n\\nOverall, India's external sector faces challenges, but it has inbuilt shock absorbers to weather them. The sector is performing relatively better compared to many of its peers, with comfortable import cover and moderate CAD. India's external debt vulnerability indicators are benign by international standards.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 3 Content:\n# Trade Helping India Reap the Benefits of Globalised World\n\n## trade helping India reap the Benefits of Globalised world\n\n11.4  In the present globalised and integrated world, trade is essential for developing countries to  reap  the  benefit  of  increased  globalisation  of  products  and  financial  markets.  It  is  well recognised that trade is not an end in itself but a means to balanced, equitable, and sustainable development. Conventional economic theories point towards potential gains that could emerge from openness to international trade and investment.\n\n- 11.5  Over time, the trade openness of countries across the globe has been increasing as measured by trade as a proportion of GDP. For the world as a whole, the share of trade as a percentage of world GDP 3  has been in the range of 50-60 per cent since 2003 and stood at 52 per cent in 2020, according to the World Bank database. For India as well, the share of trade as a percentage of GDP has been steadily increasing, being above 40 per cent since 2005 (except 2020 being the pandemic year). The ratio stands at 46 per cent in 2021 and 50 per cent for H1 of 2022.\n\n## Global Scenario\n\n11.6  Post Covid-19-induced disruptions, global trade prospects have improved in FY22. Global trade exhibited resilience in the first half (H1) of 2022, notwithstanding the headwinds from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Robust merchandise imports - emerging primarily from Europe, the United States, and parts of the developing world supported the growth of merchandise trade in H12022. This partially reflected pent-up demand relating to the legacy of the pandemic-driven spending shift from services towards goods that were constrained earlier because of the supply bottlenecks. Other factors contributing to the trend were the appreciation of the dollar in the case of the United States, the relative dynamism of intra-regional trade in Europe, and favourable terms-of-trade effects in some large emerging economies due to elevated energy prices. 4  The global trade volume grew by 4.8 per cent in H12022, on top of an impressive recovery of 9.7 per cent in 2021, as per the World Trade Organisation (WTO) statistics. The global merchandise trade in value terms rose year-on-year (YoY), by 22.2 per cent in 2021, reversing the deceleration observed in the previous three years. During the H1 of 2022, the trade-in value terms grew by 32 per cent compared to the corresponding period of 2019. 5\n\n- 11.7  However, the global trade outlook turned grimmer in the second half (H2) of 2022 on the back of a confluence of adverse factors including the increasing likelihood of a recession in the major economies and the tapering demand for consumer durables; aggressive monetary policy tightening  by  several  central  banks;  disorderly  financial  conditions;  continued  supply-chain disruptions and elevated freight charges. The leading indicators of global trade viz., inventories\n\n3 Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of GDP.\n\n4 UNCTAD, Trade and Development Report 2022, Development prospects in a fractured world: Global disorder and regional responses, October 2022.\n\n5 WTO's press release, International Trade Statistics, 5 October 2022.\n\nand new export orders seem to bear testimony to these adverse events. Trade growth is likely to  slow  in  the  closing  months  of  2022  and  into  2023,  according  to  the  WTO  Goods  Trade Barometer 6  released on 28 November 2022, as the global economy continues to be buffeted by strong headwinds. The current reading of 96.2 is below both the baseline value for the index and the previous reading of 100.0, reflecting the slowdown in demand for traded goods.\n\n11.8  Thus, as regards the future trade projections, according to the WTO, world trade is expected to lose momentum in H2-2022 and remain subdued in 2023. The organisation forecasts global trade to grow in 2023 by just 1 per cent, a sharp downward revision from the previous estimate of 3.4 per cent 7 . However, there is a high degree of uncertainty associated with the forecast due to shifting monetary policy in advanced economies and the unpredictable nature of the RussiaUkraine conflict. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), in its  Global Trade update of December 2022 has also noted that the ongoing trade slowdown is  expected  to  worsen  for  2023  and  further  that  while  the  outlook  for  global  trade  remains uncertain, negative factors appear to outweigh positive trends.\n\nfigure xI.1: Growth in Global Merchandise trade: actual and forecast\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: WTO\n\n## India's growing and diversifying trade\n\n11.9  International trade has been an important pillar of the resilience of India's external sector. Trade as a percentage of GDP for India was in the range of 12-15 per cent in the 1980s; 16-25 per cent in the 1990s and 25-50 per cent in the 2000s. In the following paragraphs, a detailed analysis of India's trade performance is presented.\n\n6 The WTO has developed a set of indicators to provide 'real-time' information on trends in world trade. The Goods Trade Barometer is a leading indicator that signals changes in world trade growth two to three months ahead of merchandise trade volume statistics. Values greater than 100 signal above-trend expansion while values less than 100 indicate below-trend growth.\n\n7 WTO's press release, International Trade Statistics, 5 October 2022.\n\nfigure xI.2: India's trade catching up with global trade levels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: World Bank database\n\ntable xI.1:  Key aspects of India's trade (calendar year-wise)\n\n|                                                  | 2019   | 2020   | 2021   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Export performance (in per cent)                 |        |        |        |\n| Share in World Merchandise Exports               | 1.7    | 1.6    | 1.8    |\n| Share in World Commercial Services Exports       | 3.5    | 4.0    | 4.0    |\n| Share in World Merchandise Plus Services Exports | 2.1    | 2.1    | 2.2    |\n| Import performance (in per cent)                 |        |        |        |\n| Share in World Merchandise Imports               | 2.5    | 2.1    | 2.5    |\n| Share in World Commercial Services Imports       | 3.0    | 3.2    | 3.5    |\n| Share in World Merchandise Plus Services Imports | 2.6    | 2.3    | 2.7    |\n| India's rank in world trade                      |        |        |        |\n| Merchandise Exports                              | 18     | 21     |        |\n| Merchandise Imports                              | 10     | 14     |        |\n| Services Exports                                 | 8      | 7      |        |\n| Services Imports                                 | 10     | 10     |        |\n\nSource: DGFT, Monthly Foreign Trade Statistics, November 2022 (based on data till October 2022)\n\n## Trends in Merchandise Trade\n\n11.10 India achieved an all-time high annual merchandise export of US$ 422.0 billion in FY22. However, the global economy has started facing formidable headwinds and the ripple effect of the global trade slowdown has started reflecting in India's merchandise export growth, wherein moderation in pace is  observed  in  2022.  Merchandise  exports  were  US$  332.8  billion  over April-December 2022 against US$ 305.0 billion during the period April-December 2021. Nonpetroleum and non-gems &amp; jewellery exports in April-December 2022 were US$ 233.5 billion, as compared to US$ 230.0 billion in April-December 2021. Petroleum, oil, and lubricants (POL) exports constituted about 21.1 per cent and non-POL exports were 78.9 per cent of total exports during FY23 (until December 2022). Owing to the rise in global crude oil prices, petroleum products continued to be the most exported commodity in FY22 and April-December, 2022, followed by gems and jewellery, organic &amp; inorganic chemicals, and drugs &amp; pharmaceuticals (Tables 6.3A &amp; B of Statistical Appendix).\n\nfigure xI.3: India's Merchandise Exports\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Department of Commerce   Note: P: Provisional\n\n## Bright spots in India's trade performance\n\n11.11 Significant  strides  in  exports  were  registered  in  drugs  and  pharmaceutical,  electronic goods, engineering goods and organic and inorganic chemicals sectors in FY22. These sectors have sustained their growth momentum despite the global headwinds in H1FY23. India's pharma exports grew despite Covid impacted disruptions in supply chain increasing significantly from US$ 15.4 billion in FY15 to US$ 24.6 billion in FY22 and stood at US$ 18.8 billion during AprilDecember 2022, registering a positive growth of 3.6 per cent over April- December 2021. The high growth in export was on account of the stocking of inventories of medicines by countries all over the world, and increased demand for vaccines and medicines related to the Covid-19 pandemic which India was in a position to provide. India has also been seeing consistent growth in exports of electronic goods. Electronic goods exports which remained below US$ 10 billion till FY19, have shown an increase of 51.6 per cent from US$ 11.0 billion during April-December\n\n2021 to  US$  16.7  billion  during April-December.  2022.  Engineering  goods  exports  crossed the US$ 100 billion mark in FY22 for the first time. Organic and inorganic chemicals exports have increased significantly in FY22 and were USD 23.0 billion during April-December 2022 registering a growth of 6.5 per cent over the same period last year.\n\n11.12 As the pandemic ebbed, India witnessed a revival in domestic demand resulting in strong import  growth.  Merchandise  imports  for  the  period April-December  2022  were  US$  551.7 billion  as  against  US$  441.5  billion  during  the  period April-December  2021. Among  major import commodities, petroleum crude &amp; products imports increased by 45.6 per cent to US$ 163.9 billion in April-December 2022 compared to US$ 112.6 billion in April-December 2021 and continue to be the highest imported commodity.\n\n11.13 Energy demand may be pushing India's imports for fuel including coal and Petroleum, Oil &amp; Lubricants (POL), whose share rose to 37.1 per cent in total imports in April-December 2022 against 30.4 per cent in the corresponding period last year. Other principal imports included electronic goods; coal, coke &amp; briquettes; machinery electrical &amp; non-electrical, and organic &amp; inorganic chemicals (Tables 6.2 A&amp;B of Statistical Appendix).\n\n## figure xI.4: India's Merchandise Imports\n\nSource: Department of Commerce Note: P: Provisional\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n11.14 The  merchandise  trade  deficit  for April-December  2022  was  estimated  at  US$  218.9 billion as against US$ 136.5 billion in April-December 2021.\n\nfigure xI.5: trends in merchandise imports, exports, and trade balance\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Department of Commerce    P: provisional\n\n11.15  The USA remained the top export destination in April-November, 2022 followed by UAE and the Netherlands. The Netherlands has displaced China from the 3rd spot as India's exporting partner. India has diversified its export destinations over time. For example, the share of South Africa in total exports has risen from 1.2 per cent in FY19 to 2.0 per cent in FY23 (April to November). Over the same period, the share of Brazil has increased from 1.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent and that of Saudi Arabia from 1.7 per cent to 2.3 per cent. As regards imports, China, UAE, USA, Russia, and Saudi Arabia have a joint share of 40 per cent of the total imports of India. However, the share of China declined to 13.8 per cent during April-November 2022 from 15.5 per cent a year ago. Similarly, the share of the USA declined to 6.9 per cent in April-November 2022 from 7.2 per cent a year ago (Refer to Table 6.4 in Statistical Appendix).\n\n## Trade in Services\n\n11.16  India maintained its dominance in the world services trade in FY22.  Despite pandemicinduced global restrictions and weak tourism revenues, India's services exports stood at US$ 254.5 billion in FY22 recording a growth of 23.5 per cent over FY21 and registered a growth of 32.7 per cent in April-September 2022 over the same period of FY22. Software and business services together constitute more than 60 per cent of India's total services exports and exhibited strong growth during Q2FY23. While strong revenues in major information technology (IT) companies from various segments such as retail and consumer business; communications and media; healthcare; and banking, financial and insurance services drove the growth in software exports, a significant pick-up in engineering, and research and development related services boosted the growth in business services exports during the quarter.\n\n11.17  Services imports rose by 25.1 per cent between FY22 and FY21 to reach US$ 147.0 billion and have registered growth of 36.7 per cent in April-September 2022 over the same period of FY22. The increase in services imports is mainly on account of payments for transport services, travel and other business services. Following the resumption of global activity, shortages of\n\nshipping vessels and high transportation costs resulted in a spike in transport payments. Travel imports saw a growth following the easing up of travel restrictions.\n\ntable xI.2:  resilient performance of Service trade (Values in uSd Billion)\n\n|                                                           | 2020-21   | 2020-21   | 2021-22   | 2021-22   | apr-Sept 2022 (p)   | apr-Sept 2022 (p)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                           | Exports   | Imports   | Exports   | Imports   | Exports             | Imports             |\n| total Services                                            | 206.1     | 117.5     | 254.5     | 147.0     | 156.1               | 90.6                |\n| Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned by others | 0.3       | 0.03      | 0.5       | 0.1       | 0.6                 | 0.1                 |\n| Maintenance and repair services n.i.e.                    | 0.2       | 0.8       | 0.2       | 1.4       | 0.1                 | 1.0                 |\n| Transport                                                 | 21.9      | 19.8      | 32.7      | 35.8      | 19.4                | 23.1                |\n| Travel                                                    | 8.5       | 11.5      | 9.1       | 16.3      | 10.5                | 13.8                |\n| Construction                                              | 2.6       | 2.6       | 2.6       | 2.9       | 1.6                 | 1.6                 |\n| Insurance and pension services                            | 2.4       | 2.1       | 3.3       | 2.1       | 1.7                 | 1.1                 |\n| Financial services                                        | 4.3       | 4.8       | 5.5       | 5.6       | 3.8                 | 3.1                 |\n| Charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e.       | 1.3       | 7.7       | 0.8       | 9.0       | 0.7                 | 4.5                 |\n| Telecommunications, computer, and information services    | 103.1     | 12.3      | 125.6     | 14.5      | 72.6                | 8.6                 |\n| Other business services                                   | 49.2      | 49.5      | 58.9      | 51.7      | 36.9                | 28.3                |\n| Personal, cultural, and recreational services             | 2.3       | 2.8       | 3.2       | 4.5       | 1.9                 | 2.9                 |\n| Government goods and services n.i.e.                      | 0.6       | 1.0       | 0.8       | 0.9       | 0.4                 | 0.4                 |\n| Others n.i.e.                                             | 9.5       | 2.6       | 11.3      | 2.2       | 6.1                 | 2.2                 |\n\nSource: RBI, BoP statement     P: provisional\n\nfigure xI.6 accelerating trend in services trade\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Department of Commerce, RBI ; P: provisional\n\n11.18 While merchandise exports are witnessing some slowdown in the second half of 2022, India's service exports have been robust. Since India offers low-cost knowledge-based services, the demand for them has not fallen even amid a global economic slowdown and a negative outlook for the near future. The estimated value of services export for April-December 2022 is  US$ 235.8 billion as against a value of US$ 184.7 billion in April- December 2021. The estimated value of services imports for April- December 2022 is US$ 135.0 billion compared to US$ 105.5 billion in the corresponding period last year.  Supported by the services sector, India's overall exports (Merchandise and Services combined) in April-December 2022 are estimated to be US$ 568.6 billion, exhibiting a positive growth of 16.1 per cent over the same period last year. Overall imports in April-December 2022 are estimated to be US$ 686.7 billion, displaying a positive growth of 25.6 per cent over the same period last year.\n\n## foreign trade policy\n\n11.19  India's Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) has, conventionally, been formulated for five years at a time. The focus of the FTP has been to provide a framework of rules and procedures for exports and imports and a set of incentives for promoting exports. The latest FTP for 20152020 is in vogue at present. To provide policy stability during the pandemic period, the fiveyear FTP 2015-20 was extended from 2020 to 2022. The policy has been further extended till March 2023 on account of volatile global economic and geopolitical situations and currency fluctuations.  During  this  period,  the  Government  has  been  taking  significant  measures  and consistently looking into opportunities to diversify the exports both in terms of products as well as potential markets. The Government is actively working on facilitating trade agreements and launching schemes in consultation with various stakeholders. In the year 2022, India signed Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with UAE and with Australia. This aims to provide greater market access with a reduction in tariff and non-tariff barriers on goods and services and make the exporters competitive. The Export Preparedness Index 8 has also been introduced to evaluate States' potentials and capacities. It will guide all stakeholders towards strengthening the export ecosystem at both the national and sub-national levels.\n\n## International trade Settlement in Indian rupees\n\n11.20  In July 2022, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular permitting an additional arrangement for invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports/imports in Indian Rupees (INR) to  promote  the  growth  of  global  trade  with  emphasis  on  exports  from  India  and  to  support the increasing interest in the global trading community in INR as an international currency. The framework involves invoicing of exports and imports in INR, market-determined exchange rates between the currencies of the trading partner countries, and settlement through special Rupee Vostro 9 accounts opened with authorised dealer banks in India.\n\n11.21  Under this arrangement for settlement, (a) Indian importers undertaking imports through\n\n8 NITI Aayog in partnership with the Institute of Competitiveness has prepared an Export Preparedness Index to identify challenges and opportunities; enhance the effectiveness of government policies; and encourage a facilitative regulatory framework. The structure of the EPI includes 4 pillars -Policy; Business Ecosystem; Export Ecosystem; Export Performance - and 11 sub-pillars -Export Promotion Policy; Institutional Framework; Business Environment; Infrastructure; Transport Connectivity; Access to Finance; Export Infrastructure; Trade Support; R&amp;D Infrastructure; Export Diversification; and Growth Orientation.\n\n9 A Vostro account is an account that a domestic bank holds for a foreign bank in the domestic bank's currency, i.e., Rupee. Such accounts enable domestic banks to provide international banking services to their clients who have global banking needs.\n\nthis  mechanism shall make payment in INR which shall be credited into the Special Vostro account of the correspondent bank of the partner country, against the invoices for the supply of goods or services from the overseas seller /supplier, while (b) Indian exporters, undertaking exports of goods and services through this mechanism, shall be paid the export proceeds in INR from the balances in the designated Special Vostro account of the correspondent bank of the partner country.\n\n11.22  The above-mentioned framework for international settlement in INR acquires significance against the backdrop of the US Fed aggressively hiking the policy rates and its hawkish stand, the consequent rallying of the US dollar to multi-decade high levels, and concomitant weakening of currencies of various EMEs including the INR. The framework could largely reduce the net demand for foreign exchange, the US dollar in particular, for the settlement of current accountrelated trade flows. Further, the use of INR in cross-border trade is expected to mitigate currency risk for Indian businesses. Protection from currency volatility not only reduces the cost of doing business but also enables better business growth, improving the chances for Indian businesses to grow globally. It also reduces the need for holding foreign exchange reserves and dependence on foreign currency, making Indian economy less vulnerable to external shocks. 10  Further, it could assist Indian exporters in getting advance payments in INR from overseas clients and in the longer term promote INR as an international currency once the rupee settlement mechanism gains traction. One of the prerequisites for the emergence of an international currency is that the said currency needs to be increasingly used for trade invoicing. In terms of foreign exchange market turnover (daily averages), as per the BIS Triennial Central Bank Survey 2022, the US dollar is the dominant vehicle currency accounting for 88 per cent of the global forex turnover. The INR accounted for 1.6 per cent. If the INR turnover rises to equal the share of non-US, nonEuro currencies in global forex turnover of 4 per cent, INR could be regarded as an international currency, reflecting India's position in the global economy. 11\n\n## Initiatives to enhance trade\n\n11.23  The commendable performance of India's exports, standing at US$ 422.0 billion in FY22, exceeding the target of US$ 400 billion, has been the culmination of efforts from all quarters and across stakeholders. Some of the factors leading to the achievement of this target were putting in place of targets by the Government, including the setting of specific targets - countrywise, product-wise, and Export Promotion Council-wise; monitoring of the targets and course correction where required. The export growth was driven by an increase in demand for products like petroleum, cotton yarn, textiles, chemicals, and engineering goods. India was able to leverage the gap in the supply of certain products in the wake of the pandemic-related disruptions and meet the global demand. Exports were also helped by favourable global commodity prices. Some of the specific schemes of the Government which have and are facilitating and encouraging exports are as follows.\n\n11.24 focus on agricultural products: India's agricultural exports achieved the highest ever export in FY22 reaching US$ 37.8 billion and it continued to perform well in FY23 with exports\n\n10 Keynote address delivered by Shri T Rabi Sankar, Deputy Governor, RBI at the Annual Day event of the Foreign Exchange Dealers Association of India (FEDAI) on 20 October 2022 in Mumbai.\n\n11 Patra, M. D (2022): India@75, RBI Bulletin, August, pp 13-34.\n\nof US$ 26.8 billion during April- November 2022 backed by an effective agriculture export policy. Pro-active support of export promotion agencies including Export Inspection Council, Plantation Boards, and Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), and export facilitating measures like online issuance of certificates required for exports, aided growth  of  agricultural  exports.  Regular  promotions  were  organised  for  agricultural  products through participation in trade fairs and special events in association with the Indian Missions.\n\nTo initiate agriculture exports from UTs of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, APEDA has linked Kashmir valley start-ups,  new  entrepreneurs,  Farmer  Producer  Organisations/farmer  groups, and exporters of the region with importers. Regular shipments of high-value Kashmir Saffron (GI) are taking place to destinations including the Middle East, EU, and North America.\n\n- 11.25 Interest  Equalisation  Scheme: This  Scheme  was  formulated  to  give  benefit  in  the interest rates being charged by the banks to the exporters on their pre- and post-shipment rupee export credits.  While extending the scheme, from 1 October 2021 onwards, subvention rates have also been reduced. Henceforth, reduced revised rates of 3 per cent (erstwhile 5 per cent) subvention to MSME manufacturing exporters and 2 per cent (erstwhile 3 per cent) applies to merchant and other manufacturer exporters exporting along 410 (erstwhile 416) HS lines.\n- 11.26 remission of duties and taxes on Exported products (rodtEp) scheme: The scheme seeks remission of Central, State and Local duties/taxes/levies at different stages at the Central, State, and local level, which are incurred in the process of manufacturing and distribution of exported products, but are currently not being refunded under any other duty remission scheme.\n- 11.27 Export  credit  Guarantee: The  Export  Credit  Guarantee  Corporation  (ECGC)  supports Indian exporters and banks by providing export credit insurance services. ECGC provides insurance cover on the export consignment to protect exporters from the consequences of the payment risks. It also provides Export Credit Insurance to Banks (ECIB) to protect the Banks from losses on account of export credit given to exporters due to the risks of insolvency and/or protracted default of the exporter borrower. The ECGC has launched a new scheme in  July 2022, under its ECIB products. Under this scheme the insurance cover to banks providing pre-shipment and post-shipment finance has been enhanced to 90 per cent from an average coverage of 70 per cent for accounts with an export working capital limit of up to X20 crore to support small exporters.\n- 11.28 Krishi udan Scheme: Krishi Udan Scheme was launched in  August 2020 on international and national routes to assist farmers in transporting agricultural products so that it improves their value realisation. Krishi Udan 2.0 was launched in October 2021 enhancing the existing provisions, mainly focusing on transporting perishable food products from the hilly areas, NorthEastern states, and tribal areas. For facilitating and incentivising the movement of agricultural produce by air transportation, the Airports Authority of India provides a full waiver of Landing, Parking charges, Terminal Navigational Landing Charges and Route Navigation Facility Charges for Indian freighters and Passenger-to-Cargo Aircraft primarily around 25 airports focusing on North Eastern, Hilly and Tribal region and 28 airports in other regions/areas. Further, five more airports have been included under the Scheme, making it 58 airports.\n- 11.29 trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme: The Government has been implementing the Trade Infrastructure for Export Scheme since FY18 to assist Central and State Government\n\nAgencies  in  the  creation  of  appropriate  infrastructure  for  the  growth  of  exports  from  the States. The Scheme provides financial assistance in the form of grant-in-aid to Central/State Government owned agencies for setting up or for up-gradation of export infrastructure as per the guidelines of the Scheme.\n\n11.30 districts as Export hubs - One District One Product Initiative:  The Districts as Export Hubs-ODOP initiative is aimed at targeting export promotion, manufacturing, and employment generation at the grassroots level, making the States and Districts meaningful stakeholders and active participants in making India an export powerhouse thereby contributing to the  AatmNirbhar mission and achieving the vision of Make in India for the world and being Vocal for Local. The initiative is  also  aimed at fostering balanced regional development across all districts of the country. It seeks to select, brand, and promote products/services from each district of the country for enabling holistic socioeconomic growth across all regions, attract investment in the district to boost manufacturing and exports. A growing emphasis on exports by focusing on districts as potential export hubs is also likely to integrate India more closely with the global value chain and propel India to be a significant exporter by leveraging the diversity and competitiveness in agriculture, marine, textile, pharmaceutical, chemicals and many engineering products.\n\n## India's Global trade Engagements\n\n11.31  This era of globalisation has been accompanied by a proliferation of trade agreements and the emergence of competing trade blocs. These trends are affecting every business, every industry, and every country so that keeping up with these changes has become a challenging task for policymakers around the globe. Governments have been pursuing international trade cooperation largely driven by diverse external and internal political economy considerations such as promoting peace and stability, increasing market size and most importantly, insuring themselves against unfavourable trade policies of other countries.\n\n11.32  India has always stood for an open, equitable, predictable, non-discriminatory, and rulebased international trading system. India considers Regional Trading Arrangements (RTAs) as 'building blocks' towards the overall objective of trade liberalisation and as complementing the multilateral trading system. Recognising that RTAs would continue to feature permanently in world trade, India has engaged with its trading partners/blocs with the intention of expanding its export market since the early part of the previous decade and began concluding, in principle agreements to  move, in some cases, towards Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreements (CECA) which covers FTA in goods, services, investment and identifies areas of economic cooperation.\n\n11.33  The economic rationale for FTAs was the diversification and expansion of India's exports to its trading partners, providing a level playing field vis-à-vis the competing countries having preferential access  in  our  trading  partners,  as  well  as  gain  easier  access  to  raw  materials  and  intermediate products, at lower costs, for stimulating value-added domestic manufacturing. In the case of the India-Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), India-Korea, and India-Japan Agreements, this was also part of a geopolitical strategy that dovetailed well into India's 'Look East Policy.'\n\n11.34  India has so far concluded 13 FTAs and 6 Preferential Trade Agreements (PTAs). The most recent in the list  are  the  India-UAE  Comprehensive  Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) which was signed on 18 February 2022 and officially entered into force on 1 May\n\n2022 and the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (Ind-Aus ECTA), which was signed on 2 April 2022 and entered into force on 29 December 2022. Further, India is  presently  engaged  in  FTA  negotiations  with  some  of  its  trading  partners,  notable  among these FTAs are - (i) India-UK FTA, (ii) India-Canada CEPA/ Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA), (iii) India-EU FTA.  Moreover, India has also initiated action to review some of the existing FTAs, namely, India-Singapore CECA, India-South Korea CEPA, and India-ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement and initiated discussions on scoping for the CECA with Australia, as envisaged under Ind-Aus ECTA. 12  Box XI.1 discusses the rise in the number of FTAs being entered into worldwide and various factors that determine their usefulness to a trading partner.\n\n## Box xI.1:  free trade agreements\n\nFTAs or RTAs in terms of the WTO rules 13 , are economic instruments available to a country for leveraging its competencies in trade and investment.  As of June 2016, all WTO members now have at least one RTA in force. There has been a substantial rise in the number of trade agreements with 355 notifications of RTAs having been made to the WTO (As of 1 December 2022- Source: WTO website). Many WTO members continue to be involved in negotiations to create new RTAs, which are  mostly  bilateral.  However,  a  recent  development  has  been  negotiations  and  new  agreements among more than two WTO members, such as:\n\n- Pacific Alliance  between  Chile,  Colombia,  Mexico,  and  Peru  (Signed  on  10  February  2014; entered into force on 1 May 2016);\n- Tripartite Agreement, linking parties to the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the East African Community and the Southern African Development Community (Launched on 10 June 2015 and entered into force at different dates by different members);\n- Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement (Signed on 8 March 2018; entered into force on 31 October 2018);\n- African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) (Signed on 21 March 2018 and entered into force at different dates by different members); and\n- Regional Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (RCEP) between the ASEAN members and six other WTO members (Signed on 15 November 2020; entered into force on 1 January 2022).\n\nThe  limited  progress  in  the  multilateral  trade  negotiations  at  the  WTO  is  one  of  the  reasons responsible for the increase in FTAs. FTAs are viewed favourably by trading countries in comparison to multilateral negotiation at the WTO forum as they are easy to negotiate and provide flexibility to factor in geopolitical considerations.\n\nThe purpose of RTAs is to lower tariffs on goods and services and increase cooperation between trading partners with the aim of increasing trade, lower prices for consumers, and provide enhanced export opportunities for producers. RTAs can also have a larger impact on the economy. For instance, Bailé et al. (2019) found that FTAs are positively correlated with direct domestic value-added exports, as well as forward and backward participation in global value chains.\n\n12 For an understanding of various types of trade agreements that India has entered into, may refer to: https://www.tpci.in/research\\_report/typesof-trade-agreements/.\n\n13 RTAs, as per WTO rules, are any reciprocal trade agreement between two or more partners, not necessarily belonging to the same region.\n\nAccording  to  the  conventional  gravity  model,  developed  by  Tinbergen  (1962),  bilateral  trade between two nations is proportional to their respective sizes, measured by their GDPs and inversely proportional to the geographic distance, a proxy for transportation cost. Over time, more variables, such as exchange rates, income levels and shifting demand patterns, have been added to the standard gravity model to test their relevance in influencing trade (Osabuohien et al., 2019).\n\nWhile an FTA provides the enabling environment for enhancing trade by reducing tariff and nontariff barriers (NTBs), the trade growth of a country depends on many factors, such as:\n\n- (a) Specific  features  of  the  FTA  such  as  the  extent  of  tariff  relaxations  given  vis-à-vis  the  Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs 14 ,  on  which products they are given and how the relaxation is staggered, i.e., is it over a long time or short time that the relaxations are agreed to be rolled out. 15\n- (b) The extent of concessions in terms of Rules of Origin (RoO) 16  and removal/easing of NTBs. While tariff barriers are agreed to be reduced in an FTA, NTBs, such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures, technical barriers to trade, contingent trade-protective measures etc., may lower the utilisation of the FTAs by traders.\n- (c) The capacity of an economy to increase the supply of products/services for which the FTA has provided an enhanced export venue. This 'supply-response' is determined by a wide range of factors which largely fall outside the ambit of an FTA. They include various policies on production  aspects,  a  country's  physical  and  institutional  infrastructure,  and  other  elements determining the short-term flexibility of an economy. In other words, the supply-response is governed by the potential for trade creation wherein a member of an FTA, having a comparative advantage in producing a product, is now able to sell it to its FTA partners because trade barriers have been removed (Viner, 1950).\n- (d) The effect of the FTA would also depend on income growth in the importing markets and the price competitiveness of exports of a partner country in a trade agreement so as to be able to take advantage of the agreement.\n\nFurther, not all trade may happen through the FTA route, especially if the RoO are cumbersome or goods are already trading at MFN zero duty. In order to take advantage of the FTAs, these must be aggressively utilised by the traders and service providers. Thus, it may not happen that there will be a sudden or significant increase in trade after an FTA is signed between two or more countries. The trade balance would shift only gradually and may also turn out to not be in favour of each partner, depending on a host of factors, some of which are listed above.\n\n## rEfErEncES\n\n- Baier, S.L., Y.V.

'On the Widely Differing Effects of Free Trade Agreements:  Lessons  from  Twenty  Years  of  Trade  Integration,'  Journal  of  International Economics 116:206-226.\n\n14 The MFN clause refers to a special trading status given by one country to another that gets applied to all the other members of the WTO.\n\n15 FTAs generally have phase-in periods in which existing trade barriers are phased out over time. This is generally done so that producers in the importing country can adjust to import competition. This typically occurs over 10 to 15 years after the ratification of the FTA.\n\n16 Rules of origin are the criteria needed to determine the national source of a product. Their importance is derived from the fact that duties and restrictions in several cases depend upon the source of imports.\n\n- Osabuohien, E. S., Efobi, U. R., Odebiyi, J. T., Fayomi, O.
