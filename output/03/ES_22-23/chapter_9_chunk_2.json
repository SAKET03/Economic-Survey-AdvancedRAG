Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23 was the highest since FY15. Exports of goods and services as a share of GDP have been the highest since FY16.\\n\\nThe increase in investment demand has emerged as a powerful stimulus to industrial growth, triggered by the augmented capex of the central government. The growth of eight core industries, including coal, fertilizers, cement, electricity, steel, and refinery products, has held steady, reflecting a broad momentum in industrial activity.\\n\\nThe electronics industry continues to ascend in importance, with India becoming the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer globally. The Indian pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticals industry, ranking 3rd worldwide in production by volume and 14th by value.\\n\\nThe government's Make-in-India initiative has facilitated investment, fostered innovation, and built world-class infrastructure. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes across 14 categories have further complemented it, with an estimated Capex of around â‚¹3 lakh crore over the next five years and the potential to generate over 60 lakh jobs.\\n\\nThe industry sector's growth has been supported by an upswing in bank credit, with credit to industry growing in double digits since July 2022. Credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase, assisted by the introduction of the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS).\\n\\nThe survey highlights the importance of the industry sector in the Indian economy and its potential to become a global manufacturing hub. The sector's growth is expected to be driven by strong domestic demand, investment revival, and export growth. However, the sector also faces challenges, including input cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and global economic uncertainty.\\n\\nThe government has implemented several measures to support the industry sector, including the PLI schemes, the Make-in-India initiative, and the ECLGS. The sector is expected to play a critical role in India's economic growth and its ambitions to become a key player in global value chains.\\n\\nThe Indian economy has made significant strides in internet penetration, which is a key requisite of Industry 4.0. The government is cognizant of the importance of Industry 4.0 in achieving the goals of Aatmanirbharta and its ambitions of becoming a key player in global value chains.\\n\\nThe Global Innovation Index (GII) ranks countries based on innovation performance, and India entered the top 40 innovating countries for the first time in 2022. India became the most innovative nation in the lower-middle-income group, overtaking Vietnam and leading the Central and Southern Asia region.\\n\\nThe 'Make in India' initiative has been striving to ensure that the business ecosystem in the nation is conducive for investors doing business in India. The reform measures include amendments to laws and liberalization of guidelines and regulations to reduce compliance burdens.\\n\\nThe DPIIT's Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2020 shows that 7,496 reforms were implemented across States and UTs, enhancing the Ease of Doing Business. Ministries and States/UTs have reduced more than 39,000 compliances, and over 3,500 provisions related to minor technical or procedural defaults have been decriminalized.\\n\\nThe National Single Window System (NSWS) was soft-launched in September 2021 to improve the ease of doing business by providing a single digital platform to investors for approvals and clearances. The portal has integrated multiple existing clearance systems of various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments.\\n\\nThe government's efforts towards fostering innovation include incubation, handholding, funding, industry-academia partnership, and mentorship. The government has strengthened its IPR regime by modernizing the IP office, reducing legal compliances, and facilitating IP filing for start-ups, women entrepreneurs, small industries, and others.\\n\\nThe start-up ecosystem in India has grown significantly, with over 48% of start-ups from Tier II & III cities. The government has given a major boost to start-ups through various initiatives, including the Start-up India Initiative, eligible companies getting recognized as Start-ups by DPIIT to access tax benefits, easier compliance, and IPR fast-tracking.\\n\\nThe 'Flipping' phenomenon, where Indian start-ups get headquartered overseas, has been observed, but the government has taken measures to encourage 'Reverse Flipping'. The measures include simplifying the process for grant of 'Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB) certification' for Start-ups, further simplification of taxation of Employee Stock Options (ESOPs), and simplifying multiple layers of tax and uncertainty due to tax litigation.\\n\\nOverall, the Indian industry sector has shown resilience and growth, driven by strong domestic demand, investment revival, and export growth. The sector is expected to play a critical role in India's economic growth and its ambitions to become a key player in global value chains.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## Introduction\n\n- 9.1 Industry holds a prominent position in the Indian economy, accounting for 31 per cent of GDP, on average, during FY12 and FY21 and employing over 12.1 crore people. The sector's relevance  can  be  identified  through  various  direct  and  indirect  linkages  with  other  sectors, contributing to economic growth and employment. First, it ensures that domestic production can  accommodate domestic demand and reduces the reliance on imports. Thereby assisting in  the  improvement  of  trade  and  current  account  balances.  Second,  industrial  growth  has multiplier effects, which translates into employment growth. Some industries, such as textiles and construction, have high employment elasticities. Third, industrial growth spurs growth in services sectors such as banking, insurance, logistics, etc.\n\nTable IX.1: Growth and Share of Industrial components (in Per cent)\n\n|                                                        | Growth in Per cent   | Growth in Per cent   | Real Gva growth in   | Real Gva growth in FY23 over   | Share in total GvaFY23   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|\n|                                                        | H1:FY23              | H2:FY23 (estimated)  | FY23 over FY22       | FY20                           |                          |\n| Industry                                               | 3.7                  | 4.5                  | 4.1                  | 11.1                           | 30.0                     |\n| Mining &quarrying                                      | 2.2                  | 2.6                  | 2.4                  | 4.4                            | 2.3                      |\n| Manufacturing                                          | 0.1                  | 3.0                  | 1.6                  | 11.0                           | 17.3                     |\n| Electricity, gas, water supply &other utility services | 10.0                 | 7.9                  | 9.0                  | 13.0                           | 2.3                      |\n| Construction                                           | 11.5                 | 7.3                  | 9.1                  | 12.8                           | 8.1                      |\n| overall Gva                                            | 9.0                  | 4.7                  | 6.7                  | 9.8                            | -                        |\n\nSource: National Statistical Office (NSO), Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) Note: Data for FY23 presents the First Advance Estimates\n\n- 9.2 Industrial production is a means to increase industrial income in the country. As measured by industrial GVA, growth in industrial income has kept pace with overall GVA growth in the economy since the pre-pandemic year of FY20. Manufacturing GVA, which contributes more than 50 per cent of industrial GVA, has grown at an even higher rate when compared to overall GVA. In FY23, the Industry sector witnessed modest growth of 4.1 per cent compared to the strong growth of 10.3 per cent in FY22. This is likely on account of input cost-push pressures, supply chain disruptions and the China lockdown impacting the availability of essential inputs and slowing the global economy. The fading away of the base effect must have also weighed on growth in FY23. On a positive note, estimates of H2:FY23 shows improvement in overall industrial growth, especially in the manufacturing sector, both yearly and sequentially. Easing input prices and conducive demand conditions will support growth, ceteris paribus.\n- 9.3 In this chapter, the survey will review the performance of the Indian industry in the current financial year. It explores the demand stimulants to industrial growth, the supply response of the industry, trends in credit to the industry and foreign investment in India's industrial sector. The chapter also addresses the developments in key sub-industries and their challenges. Towards the end, it evaluates India's aspirations and prospects of becoming a key player in global value chains.",
