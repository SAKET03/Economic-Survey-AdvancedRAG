These distortions and leakages are such that they have an adverse impact on social welfare. It was recommended that the benefit that price subsidies seek to create for the poor can be directly transferred to the poor through lump-sum income transfers, avoiding the distortions that price subsidies induce. Eliminating or phasing down subsidies is neither feasible nor desirable unless accompanied by other forms of support to cushion the poor and vulnerable and enable them to achieve their economic aspirations. The JAM Number Trinity - Jan Dhan Yojana, Aadhaar and Mobile numbers - has allowed the Government to offer this support to identified households in a targeted and less distortive way in the form of DBT.\n- 6.128 Since the inception of DBT, cumulative transfers of over ` 26.5 lakh crore in respect of Central schemes have been made through the DBT route. In this process, total savings of over ` 2.2 lakh crore have accrued as on 31 March 2021 for Central schemes alone due to the removal of 9.4 crore duplicate, fake/non-existent beneficiaries across databases.\n- 6.129 With  the  onset  of  the  Covid-19  pandemic  and  the  imposition  of  lockdown  and enforcement of social distancing norms, the DBT ecosystem faced a tough trial and emerged as a means of relief to millions of citizens whose livelihoods were impacted. DBT played a major role in sustaining life, especially for the underprivileged segments of society, helping millions by providing immediate relief. Cash transfers under central schemes like PM-KISAN, MGNREGS, National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY), NRLM, National Health Mission (NHM), scholarship schemes of various ministries  through  the  National  Scholarship  Portal  (NSP)  and  food  subsidy  under  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana and Atma Nirbhar Bharat Package were a big relief for all the adversely affected masses of India during the Covid-19 period.\n- 6.130 To make DBT schemes more accessible and transparent, major DBT schemes are being end-to-end digitized (EED) with provision for online and mobile-based access. 170 and 150 Central Government DBT schemes are EED and available on Unified Mobile Application for New Age Governance (UMANG) mobile platform respectively. Similarly, over 1000 States /  UTs DBT schemes are EED. For citizens who do not have access to smartphones, services available on UMANG are also available in assisted mode through Common Service Centres (CSCs) across India. The citizen experience in accessing DBT schemes through the UMANG app is markedly rich since UMANG offers a well-catalogued bouquet of services in multiple Indian languages to cater to a wide audience.\n- 6.131 India's  successful  implementation  of  DBT  has  won  praise  from  the  International Monetary  Fund  and  World  Bank,  among  other  international  organizations,  for  efficiently providing support (subsidies, food grain, and cash benefits directly) to large masses at lowincome levels (85 per cent of rural households and 69 per cent of urban households). Box VI.11 informs the progress the JAM-trinity-based DBT framework of social security schemes in India.\n\n## box Vi.13: progress in direct benefit transfer Scheme\n\nDBT was launched in 2013 to re-engineer the then-existing delivery processes using modern Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to transfer benefits directly into the preferably Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts of accurately targeted beneficiaries. In the span of the past decade, DBT has expanded from a mere 24 schemes (as part of a pilot programme) in 43 districts in 2013 to over 300 Central schemes and greater than 2000 State schemes across India by December 2022.\n\ntable: overall dbt progress report\n\n|                                                 | 2013-14   | 2016-17   | 2018-19   | 2019-20   | 2020-21   | 2021-22   | 2022-23 (till 5 Jan 2023)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|\n| no of dbt Schemes                               | 28        | 142       | 440       | 426       | 316       | 313       | 310                         |\n| total funds transferred (in ` crore)            | 7,368     | 74,689    | 3,29,796  | 3,81,632  | 5,52,527  | 6,30,265  | 3,80,380                    |\n| Cash schemes                                    | 7,368     | 74,689    | 2,14,092  | 2,39,729  | 2,96,578  | 2,68,139  | 1,71,842                    |\n| In-kind schemes                                 | -         | -         | 1,15,704  | 1,41,902  | 2,55,950  | 3,62,126  | 2,08,538                    |\n| eligible beneficiaries [non- unique] (in crore) | 10.8      | 35.7      | 129.2     | 144.7     | 179.9     | 178.9     | 159.5                       |\n\nSource: Data as reported by Ministries / Departments to DBT Mission, Cabinet Secretariat\n\nIn the years of its operation, the DBT paradigm has enabled:\n\n- Accurate identification &amp; targeting of beneficiaries;\n- Greater inclusion and ease of availing services through online application;\n- Transparency in fund transfers to beneficiaries;\n- Curbing of leakages in the benefit delivery processes through the elimination of middlemen/agents;\n- Creation of greater accountability on behalf of the Government;\n- Facilitating reforms in Government processes through re-engineering;\n- Increase in efficiency in scheme delivery processes; and\n- Effectiveness of schemes through timely implementation.",
