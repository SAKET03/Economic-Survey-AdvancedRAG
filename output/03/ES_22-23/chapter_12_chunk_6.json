See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"India's infrastructure development has been on a consistent growth curve since Independence, with significant investments in transportation, housing, commercial development, telecom, and sanitation. The government has used 'social overhead capital' to push development in remote areas through dedicated budgetary allocation, cross-subsidizing revenue-generating infrastructure, and focused program delivery. This has helped expand physical transportation and connectivity, provide services at point-of-use, and deepen digital penetration.\\n\\nIn 2019, the Government of India adopted a forward-looking programmatic approach towards infrastructure, launching the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) with a projected investment of around ₹111 lakh crore for FY20-25. The NIP aims to develop a comprehensive view of infrastructure development, monitor progress, and enable a pipeline view for investors. The funding for infrastructure comes from various sources, including government, private sector, and multilateral organizations.\\n\\nThe government has also launched the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) with an estimated aggregate monetisation potential of ₹6.0 lakh crore through core assets of the Central Government over a four-year period. The NMP aims to tap private sector investment for new infrastructure creation and provide an opportunity for deleveraging balance sheets and providing fiscal space for investment in new infrastructure assets.\\n\\nThe programmatic approach to infrastructure is complemented by structural and financial reforms, such as infrastructure financing options, creation of Dedicated Financing Institution (NaBFID), recapitalisation of other sectoral DFIs, and push to PPP ecosystem through Model Concession Agreements. The government has also launched the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, which entails creation of a common umbrella platform with all infrastructure projects incorporated within a comprehensive database for efficient planning and implementation.\\n\\nIndia has made significant progress in digital infrastructure, with the country witnessing a meteoric rise in digital adoption, including a increase in tele-density to 93%, digital payment transactions to 600 crore per month, and bank accounts to over 80%. The government has launched several initiatives, including the Digital India programme, to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy.\\n\\nThe Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has been a game-changer in real-time payments, with 782 crore transactions worth ₹12.8 lakh crore in December 2022. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) aims to create an open protocol for digital commerce, increasing freedom of choice for consumers and enabling small businesses to exercise more freedom in business decision-making.\\n\\nThe government has also emphasized the importance of radio as a medium of mass communication, with All India Radio broadcasting in 23 languages and 179 dialects from 479 stations across the country. The government has launched several initiatives to improve logistics, including the National Logistics Policy (NLP), which aims to reduce the cost of logistics in India to be comparable to global benchmarks by 2030.\\n\\nIndia's infrastructure journey has been global in outlook but domestic in innovation and implementation, with the country facing unique challenges. The government has set a vision to place India among the top three global economies and inch closer to the status of a developed nation by the 100th year of its Independence. The chapter covers the government's plans to achieve this vision, including increasing infrastructure investment, leveraging digital technologies, and improving coordination and efficiency in infrastructure projects.\\n\\nThe government has increased capital expenditure, with a sharp increase in 2022-23, and has set up a National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) to support infrastructure development. The government has also launched several initiatives to promote public-private partnerships, including the Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC) and the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme.\\n\\nThe National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) are key initiatives to support infrastructure development, with a focus on transportation, energy, and social infrastructure. The government has also launched several initiatives to improve the logistics sector, including the National Logistics Policy (NLP) and the Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) index.\\n\\nThe digital infrastructure sector has seen significant growth, with a focus on digital payments, e-governance, and digital commerce. The government has launched several initiatives to promote digital infrastructure, including the Digital India programme, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The government has also emphasized the importance of data governance and cybersecurity, with a focus on protecting user data and promoting a safe and secure digital environment.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Conclusion/Outlook\n\n## conclusion/outlook\n\n12.83 Today, we are operating in the new normal where the global economy is still recovering from the setback due to pandemic, and geo-political conflicts persist. India could effectively steer  through  the  situation  owing  to  its  dedicated  support  to  infrastructure  creation  through increased capex and strong macroeconomic fundamentals. This underpinned economic growth when the private sector was cautious in investing due to its balance sheet problems and uncertain demand outlook stemming from global shocks.\n\n12.84 The targeted  increase  in  investment  is  seen  across  all  infrastructure  sectors.  To  help sustain the investment drive, NIP provided a forward-looking roadmap of investible projects. Further, PM GatiShakti has helped accelerate infrastructure development by integrating the seven engines (roads, railways, airports, ports, mass transport, waterways, and logistic infrastructure) of growth. While traditional infrastructure sectors such as roads and railways have received a renewed push in recent years, sectors such as inland water transport and civil aviation, which have significant untapped potential, are also being encouraged sufficiently. Parallelly, the focus is also on improving coordination among different stakeholders and ministries. This will help resolve compliance issues and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of investments.\n\n12.85 Besides, the reforms being undertaken in energy and power sector will help fast-track India's progress in the next 25 years. With a population of nearly 140 crore, India has a massive demand for energy from all sectors including primary, secondary and tertiary. Affordable and\n\nreliable availability of power is critical for India's aspirations for the manufacturing sector to be fulfilled. Further, with the growing importance of clean energy, there has been a renewed push towards non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in the power sector. The government, along with the private sector, has progressively worked towards increasing the share of renewables. This will ensure a gradual but calibrated energy transition, meeting the country's sustainability targets and giving primacy to its national developmental requirements.\n\n12.86 With  the  advent  of  new  technologies,  we  are  witnessing  new  regulatory  challenges. Technology  and  innovation  are,  per  se,  neither  constructive  nor  destructive.  The  use  cases present the positive aspects of technology and innovation. The government is committed to keeping pace with the digital landscape developments including those related to legislations and frameworks. While the digital journey started with Aadhaar as a medium for service delivery at the doorstep, UPI strengthened the digital payment infrastructure. With other initiatives like CoWIN, e-RUPI, TReDS, Account Aggregators, ONDC, etc. at different stages of implementation, India has developed a unique and cogent digital story to tell.  The journey is ongoing and there is much untapped potential in India's digital public infrastructure space.\n\n12.87 In sum, the synergy between physical and digital infrastructure will be one of the defining features of India's future growth story.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernment of India vkfFkZd dk;Z foHkkx DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS",
