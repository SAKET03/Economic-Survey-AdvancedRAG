  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nThe year 2022 marked the return of high inflation, especially in advanced economies, after nearly four decades. Inflation did not spare emerging economies either. Major central banks implemented sharp increases in policy rates, with the Federal Reserve's rate hikes being the steepest since the 1970s. The RBI initiated its monetary tightening cycle in April 2022 and has since implemented a policy repo rate hike of 225 basis points. Consequently, domestic financial conditions began to tighten, reflected in the lower growth of monetary aggregates. The change in RBI's policy stance in FY23 led to a moderation of surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed during the pandemic years. Monetary policy transmission is well underway as lending and deposit rates increased following the hike in policy rates. In the government securities (G-sec) market, bond yields were on an upward trajectory until June 2022 and moderated in November and December 2022. The global tightening cycle contributed to a dampened global outlook, but the domestic appetite for credit has been on an upswing. Non-food credit offtake by scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) has been growing in double digits since April 2022. Credit disbursed by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) has also been on the rise. The balance sheet clean-up exercise has been vital in enhancing the lending ability of financial institutions. The Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.0%, while the Capital-to-Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) remains healthy at 16.0%. The health of NBFCs has continued to improve as well. Political and economic developments in 2022 led to increased volatility in capital markets around the world. However, domestic capital markets displayed some encouraging trends. The primary equity markets witnessed participation from all segments, especially with increased Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contributions. The secondary capital market indices performed better than their peers between April and December 2022. Net FPI flows turned positive in the quarter ending December 2022. The indices have displayed a decreasing trend in volatility as measured by the India Volatility Index (VIX) over this period. Insurance penetration in India has been steadily increasing, with life insurance penetration being above the emerging markets and global averages. India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. The pension sector has also been taking rapid strides since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The sector has witnessed a robust increase in the number of subscribers and assets under management (AuM). As global central banks reaffirm their hawkish stances and telegraph 'higher-for-longer' policy rates, monetary conditions are expected to remain tight worldwide. Domestically, RBI's support to growth will ensure adequate liquidity in financial markets. The growth in credit offtake is expected to sustain, and combined with a pick-up in private Capex, will usher in a virtuous investment cycle.\n\nSubchapter 8 Content:\n# Development in Capital Markets\n\n## Development in Capital Markets\n\n4.31  Global macroeconomic uncertainty, unprecedented inflation, monetary policy tightening, volatile markets, etc., resulted in hurting investor sentiments, leading to a downbeat performance of  global  capital  markets  in  FY23.  Though  global  macroeconomic  and  financial  market developments exercised some influence on Indian capital markets, India's capital market had a good year, overall.\n\n## Primary Market\n\n## equity: large number of SMes coming out with the public offer\n\n4.32  From April to November 2022, the buoyant performance of the primary market has been observed despite turmoil in global financial markets. Compared to FY22, the number of firms opting to list on the bourses increased by 37 per cent, though the amount raised declined to almost half of what was raised in the last year.\n\n2  Section 9.2.2 Mode of Sale https://ibbi.gov.in/uploads/publication/e42fddce80e99d28b683a7e21c81110e.pdf\n\n3  Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India for the year ended March 31, 2022\n\n4.33  Although the year so far has been lacklustre in terms of fund mobilisation through IPOs, the number of SMEs coming out with public offer has been quite encouraging. Compared to FY22 (until November 2021), this year, not only did the number of SMEs coming with IPOs almost double, but the total funds raised by them were almost three times the funds raised by them in the same period last year.\n\n4.34  Further, this year also witnessed the largest IPO ever in the history of India. In May 2022, the Central Government diluted its stake in the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) of India and listed it on the stock exchanges, thereby making LIC's IPO the largest IPO ever in India and the sixth biggest IPO globally of 2022. Listing of LIC accounted for more than a third of resources mobilised in the primary equity market until November 2022.\n\n## debt:  Underactivity  in  public  debt  issuances  more  than  compensated  by  private  debt placements\n\n4.35  In April-November  2022,  the  amount  of  resources  mobilised  by  the  issuance  of  debt securities in the primary market increased by 5 per cent, compared to the corresponding period last year. The total number of issues in the same period also increased by 11 per cent. From April to November 2022, public issues of debt increased by 10 per cent compared to the same period the year before, but the amount raised by public issues of debt in the same period decreased by 27 per cent. However, the underactivity in public debt issuances was more than compensated by private debt placements. The number of private debt placements increased by 11 per cent from 851 to 945, while resources mobilised increased by 6 per cent in April-November 2022, compared to the corresponding period in the year before.\n\nTable IV.6: Resource Mobilisation from the Primary Market\n\n|                         | april - nov 2021   | april - nov 2021   | april - nov 2022   | april - nov 2022   |\n|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|\n| Particulars             | no. of issues      | amount (₹ crore)   | no. of issues      | amount (₹ crore)   |\n| a. equity               | 350                | 1,81,532           | 448                | 1,14,361           |\n| IPOs                    | 76                 | 89,166             | 104                | 48,095             |\n| FPOs                    | 0                  | 0                  | 1                  | 4,300              |\n| Rights Issues           | 18                 | 22,659             | 37                 | 3,436              |\n| QIPs                    | 23                 | 26,704             | 8                  | 4,115              |\n| Preferential Allotments | 233                | 43,004             | 298                | 54,414             |\n| B. debt                 | 871                | 3,71,590           | 967                | 3,91,997           |\n| Public                  | 20                 | 9,132              | 22                 | 6,624              |\n| Private Placement       | 851                | 3,62,458           | 945                | 3,85,373           |\n| total (a+B)             | 1,221              | 5,53,122           | 1,415              | 5,06,358           |\n\nSource: SEBI\n\n## Secondary Market\n\n## Stock Market Performance: Indian stock market witnessing a resilient performance\n\n4.36  In  April-December 2022, global stock markets declined because of geopolitical uncertainty. On the contrary, the Indian stock market saw a resilient performance, with the bluechip index Nifty 50 registering a return of 3.7 per cent during the same period. The Nifty 50 - US dollar adjusted return also stood at -4.7 per cent, adjusting for the depreciation of the Indian Rupee against the US Dollar. As regards the US, S&amp;P 500 Average Index declined by 15.3 per cent, while Nasdaq Composite - heavily weighted (49 per cent) towards technology sector companies, declined sharply by 26.4 per cent.  At the end of December 2022, Sensex closed 3.9 per cent higher from its closing level on March 31, 2022. Even among major emerging market economies, India outperformed its peers in April-December 2022.\n\ntable iV.7: india outperformed its peers during fy23 (april-december)\n\n| index                     | as on 31st March 2022   | as on 30th december 2022   | Per cent change in fy22 (apr-dec)   | Per cent change in fy23 (apr-dec)   |\n|---------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| india                     | india                   | india                      | india                               | india                               |\n| Nifty 50                  | 17,464.7                | 18,105.3                   | 18.1                                | 3.7                                 |\n| S&P BSE Sensex            | 58,568.5                | 60,840.7                   | 17.7                                | 3.9                                 |\n| Emerging Markets          | Emerging Markets        | Emerging Markets           | Emerging Markets                    | Emerging Markets                    |\n| Shanghai Composite, China | 3,252.2                 | 3,089.3                    | 5.8                                 | -5.0                                |\n| Ibovespa, Brazil          | 1,19,999.0              | 1,09,735.0                 | -10.1                               | -8.6                                |\n| KOSPI, Korea              | 2,757.6                 | 2,236.4                    | -2.7                                | -18.9                               |\n| Developed Markets         | Developed Markets       | Developed Markets          | Developed Markets                   | Developed Markets                   |\n| Nasdaq, USA               | 14,220.5                | 10,466.5                   | 18.1                                | -26.4                               |\n| Dow Jones, USA            | 34,678.3                | 33,147.3                   | 10.2                                | -4.4                                |\n| S&P 500, USA              | 4,530.4                 | 3,839.5                    | 20.0                                | -15.3                               |\n| CAC, France               | 6,659.9                 | 6,473.8                    | 17.9                                | -2.8                                |\n| DAX, Germany              | 14,414.8                | 13,923.6                   | 5.8                                 | -3.4                                |\n| FTSE 100, UK              | 7,515.7                 | 7,451.7                    | 10.0                                | -0.9                                |\n| Hang Seng, Hong Kong      | 21,997.8                | 19,781.0                   | -17.5                               | -10.1                               |\n| Nikkei, Japan             | 27,821.4                | 26,094.5                   | -1.3                                | -6.2                                |\n\nSource: Refinitiv, NSE, BSE\n\nFigure IV.20: Indian Benchmark Indices witnessed swift recovery\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: SEBI\n\nfigure iV.21: india ViX witnessed declining trend\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: SEBI, Bloomberg\n\nNote: VIX stands for Volatility Index.

India VIX, which measures expected short-term volatility in the stock market, rose to a high of 32.0 on 24th February 2022 with the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Same trend was witnessed in the US equity market (measured by CBOE VIX). Following the outbreak of the conflict, the geopolitical crisis weakened market sentiments which got reflected in the downward movement of benchmark indices over a couple of weeks. Indian stock market also registered losses but recovered quickly to end on a positive note in March 2022. In April-November 2022, the India VIX witnessed a declining trend as the impact of the conflict started to wane as the year progressed.\n\nfigure iV.22: annualised Volatility in indian indices during fy23 (april-november) remained relatively low\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: SEBI\n\n## Valuations (P/E Ratio): Nifty 50 vis-à-vis the global markets\n\n4.38  Nifty 50, with its valuation at 21.8 times the  earnings of the constituent stocks (P/E ratio) on trailing basis at the end of December 2022, is expensive compared to global markets, though still lower as compared to its own last five-year average.\n\nFigure IV.23: Nifty 50 stands expensive vis-à-vis the global markets, though, still lower as compared to its own 5-year average (2017-2021)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: SEBI\n\nNotes: The MSCI World Index captures large and mid-cap representation across 23 Developed Markets (DM) countries.

However, the number of demat accounts rose sharply, 39 per cent higher by the end of November 2022 on YoY basis. However, the incremental additions of demat accounts have been on a declining trend during FY23 relative to FY22, probably because of the increased volatility in the secondary market and subdued primary market performance, amid prevailing global headwinds during the current financial year.\n\ntable iV.8: Share of individual investors in equity cash Segment turnover declined\n\n| year                     |   Share of individual investors (per cent) |\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| FY22                     |                                       41.1 |\n| FY22 (April to November) |                                       42.2 |\n| FY23 (April to November) |                                       37.5 |\n\nSource: NSE, BSE\n\nNote:  Individual  investors  include  individual  domestic  investors,  NRIs,  sole  proprietorship  firms  and  HUFs.

As a result, a sudden jump in the prices of crude oil and some base metals like Nickel and Aluminium was witnessed. However, commodity prices have seen a sharp correction as the Federal Reserve started increasing interest rates in March 2022 to combat rising inflation. Compared to 31st March 2022, the price of MCX iCOMDEX Base Metal Index declined by 19.1 per cent by the end of November 2022, followed by the bullion index (-3.5 per cent) and Energy index (-1 per cent). The prices of Aluminium, Copper, Zinc and Nickel at MCX also declined as of November 2022, compared to March 2022.\n\n## Mutual funds witnessed lower net inflows\n\n4.43  During April-November 2022, Mutual Funds witnessed significantly lower net inflows than  last  year.  However,  during  the  same  period,  some  schemes  comprising  growth/equityoriented schemes and solution-oriented schemes observed significantly higher inflows than in the previous year.\n\n4.44  On the other hand, income/debt-oriented schemes and hybrid schemes recorded outflows compared to inflows in the same period of the previous year. Outflows from liquid funds and hybrid schemes were mainly affected by increasing interest rate cycles, liquidity requirements and advance tax commitments by corporates.

Further, investors were also sitting on gains from Indian stocks that could be realised to offset losses elsewhere. However, on account of the strong macroeconomic fundamentals of the Indian economy and the improvement in market risk appetite from time to time, assets under custody (custodial holdings of FPIs reflecting the total market value of the holdings) witnessed an increase despite the outflows driven by global factors.
