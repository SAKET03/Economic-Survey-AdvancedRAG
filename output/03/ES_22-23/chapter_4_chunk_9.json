  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nThe year 2022 marked the return of high inflation, especially in advanced economies, after nearly four decades. Inflation did not spare emerging economies either. Major central banks implemented sharp increases in policy rates, with the Federal Reserve's rate hikes being the steepest since the 1970s. The RBI initiated its monetary tightening cycle in April 2022 and has since implemented a policy repo rate hike of 225 basis points. Consequently, domestic financial conditions began to tighten, reflected in the lower growth of monetary aggregates. The change in RBI's policy stance in FY23 led to a moderation of surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed during the pandemic years. Monetary policy transmission is well underway as lending and deposit rates increased following the hike in policy rates. In the government securities (G-sec) market, bond yields were on an upward trajectory until June 2022 and moderated in November and December 2022. The global tightening cycle contributed to a dampened global outlook, but the domestic appetite for credit has been on an upswing. Non-food credit offtake by scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) has been growing in double digits since April 2022. Credit disbursed by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) has also been on the rise. The balance sheet clean-up exercise has been vital in enhancing the lending ability of financial institutions. The Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.0%, while the Capital-to-Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) remains healthy at 16.0%. The health of NBFCs has continued to improve as well. Political and economic developments in 2022 led to increased volatility in capital markets around the world. However, domestic capital markets displayed some encouraging trends. The primary equity markets witnessed participation from all segments, especially with increased Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contributions. The secondary capital market indices performed better than their peers between April and December 2022. Net FPI flows turned positive in the quarter ending December 2022. The indices have displayed a decreasing trend in volatility as measured by the India Volatility Index (VIX) over this period. Insurance penetration in India has been steadily increasing, with life insurance penetration being above the emerging markets and global averages. India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. The pension sector has also been taking rapid strides since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The sector has witnessed a robust increase in the number of subscribers and assets under management (AuM). As global central banks reaffirm their hawkish stances and telegraph 'higher-for-longer' policy rates, monetary conditions are expected to remain tight worldwide. Domestically, RBI's support to growth will ensure adequate liquidity in financial markets. The growth in credit offtake is expected to sustain, and combined with a pick-up in private Capex, will usher in a virtuous investment cycle.\n\nSubchapter 9 Content:\n# Other Developments\n\n## other developments\n\n## necessity of a common approach to regulating the crypto ecosystem\n\n4.49  The recent collapse of the crypto exchange FTX and the ensuing sell-off in the crypto markets have placed a spotlight on the vulnerabilities in the crypto ecosystem.  Crypto assets are\n\nself-referential instruments and do not strictly pass the test of being a financial asset because it has no intrinsic cashflows attached to them. US regulators have disqualified Bitcoin, Ether and various other crypto assets as securities 4 .   A rare joint statement 5 by the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) on 3 rd January 2023 highlighted their concerns about crypto-asset risks to the banking system. The geographically pervasive nature of the crypto ecosystem necessitates a common approach to the regulation of these volatile instruments. In this context, the global response to cryptos is evolving, and Box 1 captures the current state of regulatory approaches to cryptos worldwide.\n\n## Box iV.1: cross country analysis: regulation of cryptocurrency\n\nCrypto assets are new forms of digital assets implemented using cryptographic techniques. The crypto asset market has been very volatile, with its total valuation swinging from almost US$ 3 trillion in November 2021 to less than US$ 1 trillion in Jan 2023. The volatility of the crypto asset ecosystem has brought to the forefront their fragile backing and governance problems, as well as the increasing complexity and non-transparency. With related financial stability risks rising, the issue of crypto asset regulation has recently moved up the policy agenda of many nations. International fora like OECD and G20 are discussing a globally coordinated approach to regulating crypto assets.\n\nZoom\n\n1d\n\n7d\n\n1m\n\n3m\n\n1y\n\nYTD\n\nALL\n\nDec 28, 2019\n\nþÿ!'Jan 24, 2023\n\nCrypto Market Capitalisation (US$ Billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: coinmarketcap.com\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\nMarket Cap 24h Vol coinmarketcap.com Monitoring and regulating cryptocurrencies have been tricky, and regulators across the globe find it challenging to keep track of the new and emerging issues in the fast-moving uncharted field. While crypto  assets  were  apparently  designed  to  disintermediate  traditional  financial  services,  this  has created new unregulated intermediating entities. The promise of decentralisation haslso yet to be realised in practice. New centralised intermediaries, such as crypto asset exchanges, wallet providers, and crypto conglomerates, require users to trust centralised entities. The increasing importance of these entities could force regulators to consider them as systemic financial market infrastructures (FMIs) 6 . Still, the fact that they are yet largely unregulated is a cause for concern globally.\n\n4    Source:https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/how-cryptos-meltdown-changed-the-regulatory debate/2023/01/07/4a469c9a-8e51-11edb86a-2e3a77336b8e\\_story.html\n\n5  Joint Statement by Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20230103a1.pdf\n\n6    As  per  Bank of International Settlements, Financial Market Infrastructure (FMI) is defined as a multilateral system among participating institutions, including the operator of the system, used for the purposes of clearing, settling, or recording payments, securities, derivatives, or other financial transactions. As per RBI, the term FMI\n\nInterestingly, holdings of crypto assets are primarily concentrated in the hands of a few 'whales'. Estimates show that around 85 per cent of all circulating Bitcoins are held by 4.5 per cent of entities (Ben Mariem et al., 2020). The underlying protocols used to create crypto assets may also conflict with other public policy objectives, for instance, the massive energy intensity of 'mining' crypto assets.\n\nThere are minimal global standards applicable to unbacked crypto assets, which do not currently mitigate all risks and vulnerabilities. Even as Standard-Setting Bodies (SSBs) have been making efforts to adjust and develop standards, these remain mainly focused on specific issues (financial integrity), sectors (payments, securities and banking), products (global stablecoins), or entities designated as systemic by domestic authorities. Thus, there are regulatory gaps at each stage when crypto assets are issued, transferred, exchanged, or stored by non-bank entities. Crypto's cross-sector and crossborder nature limits the effectiveness of uncoordinated national approaches. The terminology used to describe the different activities, products, and stakeholders is not globally harmonised. The term 'crypto asset' itself refers to a broad spectrum of digital products that may need the attention of multiple domestic regulators based on their actual or intended use. There is a range of crypto actors, such as miners, validators, and protocol developers, that may not be easily covered by traditional financial regulation (Narain &amp; Moretti, 2022).\n\nA few case studies 7 of countries and jurisdictions attempting to regulate unbacked crypto assets are discussed below:\n\n-  european Union: The European Union's digital finance strategy comprises regulating Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA). Even as the focus is on stablecoins, for other crypto assets and key entities  delivering  critical  functions  such  as  exchanges  and  wallet  providers,  MiCA  proposes onshoring, notification and licensing regimes.\n-  Japan: The  Japan  Financial  Services  Agency  introduced  regulation  of  crypto  asset  service providers in April 2017, mandating clients' asset segregation, operational risk and cyber security management,  Know-Your-Customer,  internal  audits,  and  minimum  capital  requirements.  This was implemented by amending the Payment Service Act. Further amendments to the law were made in May 2019 and June 2020 to extend crypto regulation to other entities, such as wallet service  providers,  limit  the  leverage  provided  to  retail  customers  by  crypto  asset  exchanges, and introduce regulations for security tokens and stablecoins, respectively. The law for partial amendment to the Payment Services Act, etc. was enacted in June 2022 to establish a stable and efficient funds settlement system and to provide for the regulation of stablecoins.\n-  Switzerland: The  Swiss  Financial  Market  Supervisory Authority  (FINMA)  issued  guidelines for initial coin offerings in February 2018. Three categories of tokens were introduced: payment tokens, utility tokens, and asset tokens (with a clarification that tradable tokens at pre-financing and  presale  stage  could  be  treated  as  securities).  Subsequently,  the  Financial  Services  Act harmonised prospectus requirements across all securities (including asset tokens) in June 2018. The distributed  ledger  technology  (DLT)  amended  various  civil  and  financial  market  laws  in February 2021 to enable the introduction of ledger-based securities on blockchain and provide rules for the segregation of crypto assets in the event of bankruptcy of crypto custodians.\n\n7    generally refers to systemically important payment systems, Central Securities Depositories (CSDs), Securities Settlement Systems (SSSs), Central Counter Parties (CCPs), and Trade Repositories (TRs) that facilitate the clearing, settlement, and recording of financial transactions. IMF Fintech Notes, 'Regulating the Crypto Ecosystem: The Case of Unbacked Crypto Assets'; https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/fintechnotes/Issues/2022/09/26/Regulating-the-Crypto-Ecosystem-The-Case-of-Unbacked-Crypto-Assets-523715\n\n-  United Kingdom: Financial Conduct Authority's 'Final Guidance on Crypto assets' declared in June 2019 that while security tokens (crypto assets with rights and obligations similar to 'specified investments') fell inside the regulatory purview, utility and 'exchange tokens' (i.e., unbacked crypto assets) were outside of prudential and conduct regime. Following significant consumer research on the crypto asset market, the UK Treasury set out its roadmap for crypto asset regulation in April 2022, focusing on stablecoins and a proposal for a sandbox regime for blockchain-based FMIs. Regarding regulating crypto asset promotions, the UK Crypto Assets Taskforce 8 published a report in 2018 that found that misleading advertising (overstating benefits and rarely warning retail  investors  of  volatility  and  risks)  and  lack  of  suitable  information  were  vital  consumer protection issues in crypto-asset markets. In January 2022, the UK Treasury proposed bringing crypto  assets  within  its  Financial  Promotions  Regime,  subjecting  crypto  asset  promotions  to the same high standards as for other financial promotions such as stocks, shares, and insurance products.  Similarly,  the  Monetary Authority  of  Singapore  published  guidelines  to  restrict  the marketing of crypto assets in Singapore in January 2022, limiting crypto asset promotions to an entity's corporate website, official social media accounts, and mobile applications.\n-  albania: Albania's law on 'DLT-based Financial Markets' (also known as the 'Fintoken Act') legalised  crypto  assets  in  Albania  for  investment  purposes  in  May  2020.  The  regulation  encompasses the issuance of digital tokens and virtual currencies and the licensing, monitoring, and supervision of  entities  engaged  in  distribution,  trading,  and  custody.  The Albanian  Financial  Supervisory Authority  (AFSA)  and  the  National Agency  for  Information  Society  (NAIS)  are  entrusted  as competent authorities for unbacked crypto assets (and the Bank of Albania for stablecoins). It may be noted that licensing crypto asset service providers heavily relies on third-party agents, licensed as 'Digital Token Agents' when focusing on regulatory and financial compliance side by AFSA and as 'Innovative Service Providers' when dealing with technological compliance by NAIS.\n-  nigeria: The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) declared in February 2018 that crypto assets are not legal tender in Nigeria. Further, in February 2021, the CBN wrote to regulated financial institutions that  dealing  in  crypto  assets  and  facilitating  payments  for  crypto  asset  service  providers  was prohibited. More recently, the Securities and Exchange Commission published 'New Rules on Issuance, Offering Platforms and Custody of Digital Assets,' outlining 'digital asset offerings' as within the purview of the SEC and imposing requirements on 'digital asset offering platforms' and 'digital asset offering custodians' in May 2022.\n\nDespite some progress through the AML/CFT obligations for crypto asset providers stipulated by FATF, their implementation is still a work in progress (FATF 2021), 9 with significant delays in critical areas such as the 'travel rule,' leaving the virtual asset (V A) and virtual asset service providers (VASP) sector vulnerable to criminal and terrorist misuse 10 . As of March 2022, while 29 out of 98 responding jurisdictions reported having passed Travel Rule legislation, only 11 jurisdictions have started enforcement and supervisory measures.\n\nTherefore, Global standards need to be comprehensive and consistent; regulatory responses must be based on standard taxonomies, reliable data to address contagion effects, and flexible enough to be adjusted in the future based on market developments and future international standards.\n\n8  The 'UK Crypto Asset Taskforce' comprises HM Treasury, Bank of England, and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)\n\n9  FATF, 'Second 12-month Review Virtual Assets and VASPs,' FATF, (Paris, France 2021).\n\n10    FATF, 'Targeted Update on Implementation of the FATF Standards on Virtual Assets/VASPs,' FATF, (Paris, France 2022).\n\n## ifSc - gift city\n\n4.50  Over the last few years, various initiatives taken by the government have opened up new avenues and opportunities for capital market players. Setting up and operationalising India's maiden International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) in GIFT City is the most important one.\n\nThe aim is to facilitate India to emerge as a significant economic power by accelerating the development of a strong base of International Financial Services in the country. Box 2 below discusses  the  key  role  that  IFSC  can  play  in  facilitating  India's  emergence  as  a  preferred jurisdiction  for  international  financial  services  and  encouraging  easier  access  and  greater participation from foreign investors to bring in capital to further promote India's growth.\n\n## Box iV.2: gift ifSc - emerging as a Preferred Jurisdiction for international financial Services\n\nGlobally, International Financial Centres (IFCs) have assumed prominence in the financial services ecosystem  primarily  because  they  have  contributed  enormously  to  the  growth  of  international financial transactions. These centres have played a pivotal role in accelerating the pace of financial globalisation. In common parlance, an IFC is a jurisdiction with a high concentration of financial institutions  such  as  Banks,  Stock  Markets  &amp;  related  entities,  Insurance  firms,  Fund  Managers, FinTech firms, etc., which offer specialised financial services to non-residents and residents, in an environment that promotes financial innovation and facilitates cross border transactions.\n\nGiven this backdrop, setting up and operationalising India's maiden IFSC in GIFT City has been a path-breaking financial reform underpinning India's increasingly liberal outlook towards capital account  convertibility.  GIFT-IFSC  is  housed  in  India's  first  fully  operational  Smart  City  with world-class commercial, social and physical infrastructure. To bolster the development of IFSC, the Government took a major policy decision to establish the first of its kind, unified and agile financial sector regulator for IFSCs viz International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) through an Act of Parliament in 2019. From 1st October 2020, IFSCA assumed the power of four domestic sector regulators, namely RBI, SEBI, IRDAI &amp; Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority of India (PFRDAI), in so far as the development and regulation of IFSCs in India were concerned.\n\nOver the last two years, GIFT-IFSC has witnessed tremendous growth and traction across the entire spectrum  of  financial  services,  including  banking,  capital  markets,  insurance,  fund  management, aircraft leasing, etc. With an internationally aligned regulatory regime, competitive tax structure and beneficial cost of operations, GIFT IFSC is now emerging as a preferred jurisdiction for international financial services. Recognising the growing significance of IFSC, the Global Financial Centres Index, London Report (March 2022) put IFSC in GIFT City at the top, among 15 centres globally, which is likely to become more significant over the next 2 to 3 years.\n\nGIFT IFSC has more than 390 + entities registered  across  a  full  spectrum  of  financial  services, including  Banks,  Capital  Markets,  Insurance,  FinTech, Aircraft  Leasing,  Bullion  Exchange,  etc. The financial services market is rapidly growing with the healthy and increasing participation of international and domestic financial institutions.\n\n## recent developments/milestones/innovations/collaborations with other countries\n\nIn  pursuit  of  its  vision  to  become  an  international  financial  centre  of  global  stature,  IFSCA  has continuously  engaged  in  deliberations  with  many  globally  prominent  financial  authorities  and standard-setting bodies. To date, the Union Cabinet has approved the signing of 2 Multilateral MoUs\n\n(MMoU) and 7 Bilateral MoUs (BMoUs) by IFSCA to deepen cooperation with foreign regulators and aid the mutual exchange of information for the development of financial products and services in GIFT-IFSC. The table below provides the latest status of MoUs approved by the Union Cabinet -\n\n## Multilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MMoU)\n\n-  International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO)\n-  International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS)\n\n## Bilateral Memorandum of Understanding (BMoU)\n\n-  Dubai Financial Services Authority (DFSA)\n-  Qatar Financial Services Authority (QFCA)\n-  Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM) Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA)\n-  Autorite Des Marches Financiers of France (AMF)\n-  Commission De Surveillance Du Secteur Financier (CSSF) Luxembourg\n-  Finansinspektionen (FI) Sweden.\n-  Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)\n\nBesides the above, IFSCA has also entered into agreements for technical cooperation and capacity building for  the  development of  a  world-class  regulatory  environment  for  financial  products  and financial services in IFSC. Some of the projects/agreements showcasing IFSCA's growing engagement with the global community are highlighted below:\n\n## fintech bridge with the Monetary authority of Singapore\n\nBoth India and Singapore have been pioneers in the FinTech sector. To fuel the next phase of FinTech growth,  the  Government  of  India  is  developing  GIFT  IFSC  as  the  nerve  centre  of  all  FinTech activities. Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the International Financial Services Centres Authority  (IFSCA)  have  signed  a  FinTech  Co-operation Agreement  (CA)  to  facilitate  regulatory collaboration and partnership in FinTech to promote a Joint Regulatory Sandbox Collaboration that will leverage existing regulatory sandboxes in their respective jurisdictions to support experimentation of technology innovations. The Agreement will enable FinTech firms from one jurisdiction to gain market access in the other jurisdiction through a regulatory referral system.\n\n## nSe ifSc -SgX connect\n\nNSE IFSC-SGX Connect, inaugurated by the PM on July 29, 2022, is an essential milestone in the cross-border collaboration between India and Singapore in the area of capital markets. The Connect, likely to be fully operational by June 2023, will play a pivotal role in onshoring derivative trading in NIFTY Products from SGX, Singapore, to NSE-IFSC, GIFT City. The Connect is expected to consolidate volumes and deepen liquidity in derivative instruments at GIFT IFSC, bring in more international participants and positively impact other financial ecosystems in GIFT IFSC. It has been designed to harness the advantages of respective exchanges, SGX for ease of access to investors and NSE IFSC for trading and clearing derivative contracts, in a symbiotic manner to confer gains on all.\n\n## Visibility and Mindshare among fintechs globally\n\nTo promote the FinTech ecosystem at GIFT IFSC and create visibility amongst the Global FinTech community, IFSCA, with support from GoI, has instituted a flagship financial technology and global thought leadership event, 'InFinity Forum' as an annual feature beginning in 2021. It unites the world's\n\nleading minds in policy, business, and technology to discuss and develop actionable insight into how the FinTech industry can leverage technology and innovation for inclusive growth. The first edition of the Forum held on the 3rd and 4th of December 2021, was inaugurated by the Prime Minister, with Indonesia, South Africa and the United Kingdom participating as partner countries. The event saw a total of 94,300 registrations, leaving behind a massive international footprint.\n\n## Cooperation agreement between India INX and Luxembourg Stock Exchange\n\nIndia  INX,  an  IFSC-based  exchange,  signed  a  cooperation  agreement  with  Luxembourg  Stock Exchange on June 01, 2022. The two exchanges will endeavour to enhance the visibility of listed Indian  securities  towards  international  investors  by  facilitating  the  admission  of  such  securities listed on LuxSE. The Agreement builds on the Memorandum of Understanding signed between the two institutions in November 2020, which focuses on advancing green finance in India. The green corridor opportunity established with this dual listing cooperation agreement between India INX and LuxSE will go a long way in attracting more issuers from India and the region and provides access to green capital from international investors.\n\n## ifSca Vision for fy24 and beyond\n\nFY23 is a watershed year for IFSC. It marks a decade of India's maiden IFSC. The vision plan beyond 2022 revolves around elevating GIFT-IFSC to a virtuous self-sustaining trajectory towards becoming the  nerve  centre  of  new-age  global  financial  services  and  activities.  This  aspirational  pursuit  of integrating our economy with the global financial ecosystem has been rich in learnings which are being systematically capitalised to design cutting-edge statutory and regulatory frameworks to lift the centre into a higher orbit of financial innovation and dynamism.\n\nWithin years of its establishment, GIFT-IFSC has become a prominent gateway for the flow of global capital  into  India.  Significant  gains  have  been  made  in  kickstarting  experimental  and  innovative financial services such as bullion trading, aircraft and ship leasing, global-in house centres, Fintech, sustainable financing and cross-border bill discounting and factoring. Sophisticated financial products such as Bullion Depository Receipts, unsponsored Depository Receipts, and financial and operational leases have been introduced, with many more in the pipeline. State-of-the-art infrastructure has been created for wholesome quality of life with essential projects including metro connectivity, integrated residential projects, Central Park, Riverfront and recreational centres on the anvil.\n\nThe  foundation  has  been  laid  for  creating  a  thriving  knowledge  economy  by  allowing  foreign universities  to  set  up  operations  in  IFSC  free  of  domestic  regulations.  Simultaneously,  external assistance is mobilised to establish India's premier Fintech Institute and Innovation Centre in GIFT City. The Centre, with an estimated cost of ₹800 crore, will underpin India's growing stature and leadership in Fintech and attract the best of talent globally.\n\nSignificantly, the Government's vision for GIFT-IFSC transcends much beyond traditional finance and ventures into thought leadership. It is envisioned as the embodiment of Aatmanirbhar Bharat, a hub of ingenuity and innovation. As we advance, the vision entails a quantum leap in imagination and endeavours to transform GIFT City into a bustling financial hub, a vibrant city bearing a distinctively international character and pioneering solutions to complex problem statements involving finance.",
