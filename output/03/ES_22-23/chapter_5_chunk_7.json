The consumer price inflation in India went through three phases in 2022: a rising phase up to April 2022, a holding pattern at around 7.0% up to August 2022, and a decline to around 5.7% by December 2022.\\n\\n### Inflation Phases\\n\\n* The rising phase was largely due to the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war and a shortfall in crop harvests due to excessive heat in some parts of the country.\\n* Prompt and adequate measures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have reined in the rise in inflation and brought it within the Central Bank's tolerance limit.\\n\\n### Comparison with Western Countries\\n\\n* In contrast, major Western countries, which pumped stimulus during the pandemic periods, continue to grapple with high levels of inflation.\\n\\n### Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI)\\n\\n* The divergence between a relatively high WPI inflation and lower CPI inflation widened in May 2022, primarily owing to a difference in relative weights of the two indices and the lagged effect of imported input costs on retail prices.\\n* However, the gap between the two measures of inflation has reduced since then, demonstrating a tendency towards convergence.\\n\\n### Core Inflation\\n\\n* An important measure of demand-pull inflation - core inflation - remains sticky.\\n* There have been significant variations in retail inflation rates among the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India.\\n\\n### Housing Price Index (HPI)\\n\\n* According to Housing Price Index (HPI) published by National Housing Bank (NHB), the overall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market price in Quarter Ending (QE) September 2022 over QE September 2021 indicates a revival in the housing finance sector.\\n\\n### Monetary Policy\\n\\n* RBI's Monetary Policy Committee increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 225 basis points from 4.0% to 6.25% between May and December 2022.\\n* Central Government has undertaken fiscal measures like reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, prohibition of the export of wheat products, imposition of export duty on rice, reduction in import duties and cess on pulses, rationalisation of tariffs and imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds, maintenance of buffer stock for onion and pulses and rationalisation of import duties on raw materials used in the manufactured products.\\n\\n### Inflation Forecast\\n\\n* The RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term, owing to supply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike, reflecting high feed costs.\\n* In general, climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to food prices.\\n\\n### Key Policy Recommendations\\n\\n* The government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices.\\n* India's retail inflation rate peaked at 7.8% in April 2022. The overshoot of inflation above the upper end of the target range in India was one of the lowest in the world.\\n\\n### Findings\\n\\n* The year 2022 was marked by a return of high inflation in the advanced world after three to four decades, depending on the country.\\n* In India, the government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices.\\n\\n### Retail Inflation\\n\\n* Retail inflation was mainly driven by higher food inflation, while core inflation stayed at a moderate level.\\n* Food inflation ranged between 4.2% to 8.6% between April and December 2022, while the core inflation rate stayed at around 6% except in April 2022.\\n\\n### Food Inflation\\n\\n* Food inflation based on Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) climbed to 7.0% in FY23 from 3.8% in FY22.\\n* The major contributors to food inflation are vegetables, cereals, milk, and spices.\\n\\n### Rural-Urban Inflation Differential\\n\\n* Rural inflation has remained above its urban counterpart throughout the current fiscal year, reversing the trend seen during the pandemic years.\\n\\n### Wholesale Price Inflation\\n\\n* WPI-based inflation remained low during the Covid-19 period and started to gain momentum in the post-pandemic period as economic activities resumed.\\n* The wholesale inflation rate climbed to about 13.0% in FY22.\\n\\n### Convergence of WPI and CPI Inflation\\n\\n* The headline inflation based on WPI and the CPI-C started diverging in March 2021, as WPI inflation touched double digits due to unfavourable base effects while CPI-C inflation remained stable.\\n* The gap began to narrow until April 2022. The path to convergence, however, was short-lived as another inflationary pressure started building up in February 2022.\\n\\n### Inflationary Expectations\\n\\n* Inflationary expectations are decisive in charting the course of inflation.\\n* The RBI's anchoring of inflationary expectations through forward guidance and responsive monetary policy has helped guide the trajectory of inflation in the country.\\n\\n### Housing Prices\\n\\n* Housing prices provide helpful information on the state of the economy via booms and busts in asset markets, which give rise to economic imbalances.\\n* Monitoring housing prices is essential for achieving the objectives of price stability, financial stability, and growth.\\n\\n### Pharmaceutical Prices\\n\\n* The principles for the regulation of the prices of drugs are based on the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Policy, 2012, administered by the Department of Pharmaceuticals.\\n* The key principles of the policy are the essentiality of drugs, control of formulation prices, and market-based pricing.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\n* It is not wishful thinking that 2023 will show less macroeconomic volatility than its preceding financial year.\\n* Both CPI-C and WPI have fallen below 6% (which is the RBI tolerance limit for the former) and are on the descending slope of the surge that hit the economy in the first half of the current fiscal.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Conclusion\n\n## Conclusion\n\n5.36  It  is  not  wishful  thinking  that  2023  will  show  less  macroeconomic  volatility  than  its preceding  financial  year.  Both  CPI-C  and  WPI  have  fallen  below  6  per  cent  (which  is  the RBI tolerance limit for the former) and are on the descending slope of the surge that hit the economy in the first half of the current fiscal. International crude oil prices, the principal drivers of inflation this financial year, have returned to normal levels and so have prices of other major commodities. RBI projects CPI inflation for Q1 - FY24 at 5.0 per cent and for Q2 -FY24 at 5.4 per cent on the assumption of a normal monsoon.\n\n- 5.37  India's inflation management has been particularly noteworthy and can be contrasted with advanced economies that are still grappling with sticky inflation rates. Due to the anticipated slowdown in advanced economies, inflation risks coming from global commodity prices are likely  to  be  lower  in  FY24  than  in  FY23.  However,  in  terms  of  overall  risks  to  the  benign baseline view on inflation, upside risks to India's projected rates may outweigh the downside\n\nrisks. For instance, the re-emergence of Covid-19 in China can trigger supply chain disruptions as was the case during the pandemic period. On the other hand, if China returns to normalcy from Covid-19, there can be a surge in commodity demand - thus reversing the recent slump in commodity prices. Further, the probability of a soft landing in the US economy has risen in  recent  months,  and  that  might  keep  up  the  US  demand  for  oil.  Similarly,  the  geopolitics associated with oil can particularly affect our imported inflation.\n\n- 5.38  RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term owing to supply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike reflecting high feed costs. In general, climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to food prices. A lot depends on industrial input prices: they may ease, but on the flip side their delayed pass-through to consumer prices may contribute to the stickiness of core inflation.\n- 5.39  Still, overall, the inflation challenge in FY24 must be a lot less stiff than it has been this year. We expect monetary and fiscal authorities to be as proactive and vigilant as they have been this year.",
