  "content": "Chapter 2 Summary:\nThe Indian economy has undergone significant structural and governance reforms from 2014 to 2022, enhancing its overall efficiency. Despite balance sheet stress caused by a credit boom in previous years and global shocks, the economy is well-positioned to grow faster in the coming decade. The reforms focused on creating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, co-partnering with the private sector, and improving agricultural productivity. India's growth outlook seems better than in the pre-pandemic years, with a potential growth rate of 6.5% in the medium term, which could rise to 7-8% if further reforms are pursued. The economy has started benefiting from efficiency gains due to formalization, financial inclusion, and digital technology-based economic reforms. A fresh credit cycle has begun, evident from double-digit growth in bank credit. The government has introduced policies to support domestic industrialization, including the Production Linked Incentives (PLI) scheme, and has liberalized foreign investment policies. The digital economy has grown at 2.4 times the overall economic growth between 2014 and 2019. Financial inclusion has increased, with 78% of the population covered with bank accounts in 2019-21. Digital public goods, such as Aadhar, have supported financial inclusion and formalization. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has enhanced the ease of doing business, and the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) has transformed the real estate sector. The government has also introduced trust-based governance reforms, such as decriminalization of minor economic offenses and simplification of regulatory frameworks. Taxation ecosystem reforms have reduced the tax burden on individuals and businesses, and GST has helped businesses by reducing compliances and ensuring a free flow of goods across states. The Indian economy is expected to benefit from the diversification of global supply chains, with multinational firms exploring strategies to diversify their production bases and supply chains. India's growth potential can be further enhanced by pursuing reforms to address structural challenges, such as power sector issues, education, and skilling.\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Returns to the Economic and Structural Reforms after 2014\n\n## returns to the economic and structural reforms after 2014\n\n## shocks that the economy faced during 2014-22\n\n2.29  Under normal circumstances, comprehensive and wide-ranging reforms undertaken in the economy during the last eight years (as covered in the previous section) would have accelerated India's growth. But that was not to be. The 'culprit' is India's balance sheet stress caused by the credit boom in previous years. As per data from the Bank for International Settlements, India's non-financial private sector debt to GDP ratio went up from 72.9 per cent in March 2004 to 113.6 per cent by December 2010. That is an increase of 40.7 percentage points in just over six years. In rupee terms, the amount of debt accumulated by the non-financial sector went up from nearly 44 lakh crore to almost 133 lakh crore. It trebled in six years. Despite limited economic reforms, global capital flows and optimism about BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) triggered a domestic credit and investment boom that eventually proved unsustainable, as the twin deficit - fiscal and external - crisis of 2013 revealed. Thereafter the non-financial private sector debt to GDP ratio began to come down meaningfully only from 2015 onwards, dropping to a low of 83.8 per cent by December 2018. That is nearly a 30 percentage point reduction from 113.6 per cent in December 2010 over eight years.\n\n2.30 Unsurprisingly, the credit to the private non-financial sector as a per cent of GDP was consistently below its trend value for most of the second decade of the millennium, implying a negative credit gap to GDP ratio (Figure II.11). The gap worsened to an unprecedented level of 25 per cent in 2017.  A statistically significant negative correlation (-0.5) between the Gross NPAs and credit growth shows that the banks' credit supply was severely constrained due to stress in their balance sheet during the second decade. 25 That explains the large negative deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its trend.\n\n25 Muduli, S. and Behera, H., 2021.

Hence,  banks'  non-performing  assets  began  to  rise. That  set  in  motion  a  long  period of repair of the financial and non-financial sector balance sheets in the second half of the last decade. The government and the RBI took several policy initiatives to help the financial sector recoup the balance sheet stress during the 2010s. Some of these such as the amendment to the SARFAESI Act 2002, implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), launch of 'Asset Quality Review' (AQR), introduction of prompt corrective action (PCA) framework, recapitalisation of Public Sector Banks (PSB), and merger of PSBs among others, helped in cleaning up the balance sheets of banks/corporates.\n\n2.32  Even as the balance sheets of banks and companies began to mend and improve, came the collapse of the Infrastructure Finance and Leasing Services (IL&amp;FS) in September 2018. It was a big non-banking financial company (NBFC) with a huge asset base. Its collapse also had a huge ripple effect on other non-banking financial entities. Few housing finance companies went under as well. Hence, housing loan disbursements were disrupted. Usually, non-banking finance companies lend to more borrowers and riskier borrowers than banks. They are refinanced by banks. Their re-financings came down in the wake of the collapse of IL&amp;FS, a big NBFC, followed by the collapse of some housing finance companies. Therefore, bank credit growth came down to single digits towards the end of 2019, continuing into 2020. Low credit growth and hence weaker capital formation impacted economic growth.\n\n2.33  The government responded with several measures to stem the fallout of the collapse of IL&amp;FS and housing finance companies, including a corporate tax cut in September 2019. Soon thereafter, the pandemic struck, and the government had to address the emerging health, social and economic consequences of unprecedented nature. These have been discussed in detail in the previous two economic surveys of 2020-21 and 2021-22. These back-to-back shocks have delayed the impact of such momentous reforms on the economic growth.\n\n## The period 2014-2022 is analogous to the period 1998-2002\n\n2.34  India's recent economic history provides a similar parallel to this situation. During 19982002, transformative reforms were launched but yielded lagged growth dividends (Table II.3). This phenomenon was attributed to a series of one-off shocks resulting from external factors and the domestic financial sector clean-up, which overshadowed the growth returns from 1998 to 2002 26 . By 2003, when the shocks dissipated, India participated in the global boom and grew at a higher rate. Similarly, in the present context, as the global shocks of the pandemic and the spike in commodity prices in 2022 fade away, the Indian economy is well placed to grow at its potential in the coming decade.\n\nTable II.3: a parallel between the periods: 1998-2002 and 2014-2022\n\n| 1998-2002                                                                                                                                    | 2014-2022                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| shocks to the economy                                                                                                                        | shocks to the economy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n|  Nuclear device testing 1998; sanctions followed                                                                                            |  Period of Banking, Non-Banking and Non- Financial Corporate Sector Balance-sheet stress                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n|  Banking and Corporate Sector deleveraging and repairing balance-sheets  Two successive droughts  Technology bust; US recession and 09/11 |  Unprecedented pandemic shock followed by inflation global commodity price shock followed by tightening of financial conditions                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| structural reforms in the economy                                                                                                            | structural reforms in the economy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|  Interest rate deregulation  Privatisation  Asset Recovery for banks  Infrastructure (Golden quadrilateral)  FRBMAct                    |  Unique Identity  Financial Inclusion  GST leading to formalisation  Insolvency &Bankruptcy Code  Privatisation  Taxrates rationalisationandtax administration reforms  Decriminalisation of offences  Vaccines roll-out  Expenditure Management Reforms  AatmaNirbhar Bharat  Public Digital Infrastructure |\n| Growth returns                                                                                                                               | Growth returns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|  One-off shocks delayed the growth returns                                                                                                  |  Balance sheets strengthened in the financial sector; the corporate sector deleveraged by about 30 percentage points (Non-financial private sector debt to GDPratio)                                                                                                                                                   |\n|  Once shocks faded away, structural reforms paid growth dividends from 2003 onwards                                                         | • Emphasis on macro-economic stability while dealing with global shocks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n\n26 Refer Paragraph 6 of this chapter for details",
