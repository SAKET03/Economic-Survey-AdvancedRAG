See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"India's external sector has faced challenges due to global commodity prices, tightening international financial conditions, and a looming global growth slowdown. However, it has been able to navigate these headwinds due to strong macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers. During FY23, India's exports have shown resilience, with petroleum products, gems & jewelry, organic & inorganic chemicals, drugs & pharmaceuticals being the leading export items. The slowdown in Indian exports is inevitable in a slowing global economy characterized by slowing global trade.\\n\\nTo nurture the inherent comparative advantage that Indian exports embody, various export promotion measures are being considered/implemented. These measures would include the National Logistics Policy, which would ease domestic frictions to encourage Indian exports by reducing the cost of internal logistics. The latest Free Trade Agreements, such as with UAE and Australia, would address external frictions by creating opportunities for exports at concessional tariffs and non-tariff barriers.\\n\\nIndia's balance of payments (BoP) encountered pressures during the year under review, with the Current Account Deficit (CAD) widening due to a sharp rise in oil prices. However, the expected easing of crude oil prices, resilience of net services exports, and buoyant inward remittances would result in a lower CAD during the remainder of FY23. India's external sector has fortified shock absorbers, including forex reserves of $562.72 billion, which can cover 9.3 months of imports, and a sustainable external debt-to-GDP ratio of 19.2%.\\n\\nThe global economy has experienced two major shocks: the 2007-08 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had a contrasting impact on the global economy, with economic growth declining to -3.8% in 2020. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has further amplified the situation, leading to a rise in inflation rates.\\n\\nIndia's trade performance has been resilient, with merchandise exports reaching an all-time high of $422 billion in FY22. However, the growth momentum has moderated in 2022 due to global headwinds. Non-petroleum and non-gems & jewelry exports have sustained their growth momentum, with notable growth in drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronic goods, engineering goods, and organic and inorganic chemicals.\\n\\nIndia's merchandise trade deficit for April-December 2022 was estimated at $218.9 billion. The services sector has been a bright spot, with exports standing at $254.5 billion in FY22, registering a growth of 23.5% over FY21. Software and business services constitute more than 60% of India's total services exports.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports/imports in Indian Rupees (INR) to promote the growth of global trade with emphasis on exports from India. The framework involves invoicing of exports and imports in INR, market-determined exchange rates, and settlement through special Rupee Vostro accounts.\\n\\nIndia's current account balance (CAB) recorded a deficit of $36.4 billion (4.4% of GDP) in Q2FY23. The widening of the CAB was mainly due to a higher merchandise trade deficit and an increase in net investment income outgo. Net services receipts increased from $51.4 billion in H1FY22 to $65.5 billion in H1FY23, primarily due to robust computer and business services receipts.\\n\\nRemittances are the second-largest major source of external financing after service exports, contributing to narrowing the CAD. India has the largest emigrant population and is the top remittance recipient country, with remittances anticipated to reach a milestone of $100 billion in 2022.\\n\\nForeign investment, consisting of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), is the largest component of the capital account. Net FDI inflows at $20.0 billion in H1FY23 were comparable with $20.3 billion in H1FY22. However, FPI flows turned negative in Q1FY23, leading to a net outflow of $14.6 billion.\\n\\nIndia's external debt, at $610.5 billion as of end-September 2022, grew by 1.3% over $602.9 billion as of end-September 2021. However, external debt as a ratio to GDP fell to 19.2% as of end-September 2022 from 20.3% a year ago. India's external debt vulnerability indicators continued to be benign, with external debt as a ratio to GDP at 19.2% and the debt service ratio at 5.0%.\\n\\nThe exchange rate of the Indian Rupee is market-determined, with the RBI intervening mainly to contain excessive volatility. On a financial year basis, the INR depreciated against the US$ by 8.3% from April to December 2022. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) of the US dollar appreciated by 7.8% in the calendar year 2022, while the NEER of India depreciated by 4.8%.\\n\\nThe international investment position (IIP) shows that Indian residents' overseas financial assets at $847.5 billion were lower by $73.0 billion or 7.9% compared to the level as of end-March 2022. India's net IIP position was valued at $389.6 billion as of end-September 2022, increasing by $31.4 billion over the level as of end-March 2022.\\n\\nOverall, India's external sector faces challenges, but it has inbuilt shock absorbers to weather them. The sector is performing relatively better compared to many of its peers, with comfortable import cover and moderate CAD. India's external debt vulnerability indicators are benign by international standards.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Exchange Rates Moving in Tandem with Global Developments\n\n## Exchange rates Moving in tandem with Global developments\n\n11.44  The exchange rate of the Indian Rupee is market-determined as the RBI's intervention in the foreign exchange market is mainly to contain instances of excessive volatility. On a financial year basis, i.e., from  April to December 2022, the INR has depreciated against US$ by 8.3 per cent. 20 Over the same period, the US dollar has appreciated by 4.4 per cent in terms of the US dollar index. 21 This holds even on a calendar year basis, i.e., from January to December 2022, the INR has depreciated by 10.8 per cent whereas the US dollar has appreciated by 6.4 per cent. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate  (NEER) of the US dollar (27 economies)  appreciated by 7.8  per cent in  the calendar year 2022, up to December, while the NEER of India (64 economies) depreciated by 4.8 per cent. In other words, it is not that the INR has weakened, but it is the US dollar that has strengthened. No matter how many tweets are written against that observation, it is a fact. Several other currencies depreciated even more value against the US dollar than the INR (Refer Figure I.12 of Chapter I). Thus, the external value of INR vis-à-vis the US dollar has seen very orderly movements during the year since the onset of the current geopolitical crisis.\n\n11.45   Further, the INR appreciated against select major currencies barring the US dollar.  The average exchange rate of INR against the Pound Sterling appreciated by 6.7 per cent in April -December 2022 over April - December 2021. This rate of appreciation was 14.5 per cent with respect to the Japanese Yen and 6.4 per cent against the Euro.\n\n20  Change in Monthly average exchange rate in December 2022 over April 2022.\n\n21 The U.S. dollar index (US$X) is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies. These are: the Euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Swedish krona.\n\nfigure xI.16 Exchange rate of Indian rupee vis-à-vis Major currencies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI\n\nNote: The exchange rate for Japanese Yen is in Rupees per 100 Yen.\n\n11.46  Cross-country comparisons of exchange rate movements are often made on an inflationadjusted basis or what is called in real effective terms, viz. the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER).  On  a  financial  year  basis,  i.e.,  between April  2022  and  December  2022,  the  INR depreciated 3.4 per cent and 4.0 per cent measured in terms of 6-currency and 40-currency tradeweighted indices, respectively. Thus, even in real terms, the INR witnessed modest depreciation in the face of global spill overs.\n\n11.47  In terms of the 6-currency NEER (trade-weighted), the rupee depreciated by 4.4 per cent in December 2022 over April 2022. Similarly, the rupee depreciated by 4.7 per cent in terms of 40-currency NEER 22   (trade-weighted) in December 2022 over April 2022.\n\nxI.17: Movement of Index of 6-currency and 40-currency nEEr and rEEr (trade-based weight) (the base Year 2015-16 = 100)\n\na. 6- currency trade-Based\n\nb. 40- currency trade Based\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI\n\n22 The indices NEER and REER are used as indicators of external competitiveness. NEER is the weighted average of bilateral nominal exchange rates of the home currency in terms of foreign currencies, weights being based on the average of India's bilateral trade (exports plus imports) with countries/regions represented by the 6/40 currencies during the preceding three years. The REER, defined as a weighted average of nomi -nal exchange rates adjusted for relative price differential between the domestic and foreign countries, relates to the PPP hypothesis.",
