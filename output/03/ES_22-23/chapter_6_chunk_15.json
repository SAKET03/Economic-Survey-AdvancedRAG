Some of the recent measures taken towards improving rural governance are narrated below.\n\n## rashtriya gram Swaraj abhiyan\n\n6.133 A CSS of Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) was approved by the Union Cabinet in April 2018 for implementation from FY19 to FY22 with the primary aim of strengthening Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) for achieving SDG's with the main thrust on convergence with Mission Antyodaya and emphasis on strengthening PRI's in the 117 Aspirational Districts. The scheme extends to all states and UTs including non-Part IX of the Constitution of India areas where Panchayats do not exist.\n\n6.134 The major focus of the scheme of RGSA was Capacity Building and Training (CB&amp;T) to empower PRIs and to prepare convergent Plans at the respective level of Panchayats. Under the Scheme, not only around 31 lakh elected representatives (ERs) have been capacitated through various modes of training but also functionaries and other stakeholders of Panchayats including SHG members have been provided training for better SHG-PRIs convergence at the grassroots level to create an ecosystem to prepare inclusive village poverty reduction plan.\n\n6.135 The scheme has been revamped and approved in April 2022 for implementation over the period FY23 to FY26. The focus of the scheme of Revamped RGSA is on re-imagining PRIs as vibrant centres of local self-governance with a special focus on the Localisation of SDGs (LSDGs) at the grassroots level adopting thematic approach through concerted and collaborative efforts of Central Ministries and State line departments and other stakeholders with 'Whole of Government and Whole of Society' approach. The Scheme has been formulated with the aim to strengthen the capacities of institutions for rural local governance to become more responsive towards  local  development  needs,  prepare  participatory  plans  leveraging  technology,  and efficiently utilise available resources for realising sustainable solutions to local problems linked to SDGs adopting the nine thematic approaches of LSDGs. 59\n\n## SVamitVa Scheme\n\n6.136 SVAMITVA ( Survey of Villages a nd Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas ) is a Central Sector Scheme launched on 24 April 2020, the National Panchayati Raj Day. The scheme aims to provide the 'Record of Rights' to village household owners possessing houses in inhabited rural areas. The scheme covers multifarious aspects viz. facilitating monetization of properties and enabling bank loans; reducing property-related disputes; comprehensive villagelevel planning, which would be the stepping-stone towards achieving Gram Swaraj in the true sense and making rural India Atmanirbhar. The scheme aims to provide the following benefits:\n\n- Creation of accurate land records for rural planning and reducing property-related disputes.\n- To bring financial stability to the citizens in rural India by enabling them to use their property as a financial asset for raising loans and other financial benefits.\n- Determination of property tax, which would accrue to the Gram Panchayats directly in states where it is devolved or else, add to the state exchequer.\n- Creation of survey infrastructure and GIS maps that can be leveraged by any department for their use.\n\n59  Following are the themes for LSDGs: Poverty Free and Enhanced Livelihoods in Village; Healthy Village; Child-Friendly Village; Water Sufficient Village; Clean and Green Village; Village with Self-Sufficient Infrastructure; Socially Secured and Socially Just Village; Village with Good Governance and Women Friendly Village.\n\n- To support the preparation of a better-quality Gram Panchayat Development Plan by making use of GIS maps.\n\n6.137 As on 31 December 2022, drone surveys have been completed in 2.15 lakh villages across the country, and saturated in the States of Haryana, Uttarakhand, Goa, and UT of Lakshadweep, A&amp;N Islands, Delhi, Puducherry, and Dadra &amp; Nagar Haveli, and Daman &amp; Diu. Over one crore property Cards have been prepared for nearly 65,000 villages. Property Cards of all the inhabited villages of Haryana followed by Uttarakhand, and Puducherry has been prepared.",
