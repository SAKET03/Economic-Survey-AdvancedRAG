  "content": "Chapter 2 Summary:\nThe Indian economy has undergone significant structural and governance reforms from 2014 to 2022, enhancing its overall efficiency. Despite balance sheet stress caused by a credit boom in previous years and global shocks, the economy is well-positioned to grow faster in the coming decade. The reforms focused on creating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, co-partnering with the private sector, and improving agricultural productivity. India's growth outlook seems better than in the pre-pandemic years, with a potential growth rate of 6.5% in the medium term, which could rise to 7-8% if further reforms are pursued. The economy has started benefiting from efficiency gains due to formalization, financial inclusion, and digital technology-based economic reforms. A fresh credit cycle has begun, evident from double-digit growth in bank credit. The government has introduced policies to support domestic industrialization, including the Production Linked Incentives (PLI) scheme, and has liberalized foreign investment policies. The digital economy has grown at 2.4 times the overall economic growth between 2014 and 2019. Financial inclusion has increased, with 78% of the population covered with bank accounts in 2019-21. Digital public goods, such as Aadhar, have supported financial inclusion and formalization. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has enhanced the ease of doing business, and the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) has transformed the real estate sector. The government has also introduced trust-based governance reforms, such as decriminalization of minor economic offenses and simplification of regulatory frameworks. Taxation ecosystem reforms have reduced the tax burden on individuals and businesses, and GST has helped businesses by reducing compliances and ensuring a free flow of goods across states. The Indian economy is expected to benefit from the diversification of global supply chains, with multinational firms exploring strategies to diversify their production bases and supply chains. India's growth potential can be further enhanced by pursuing reforms to address structural challenges, such as power sector issues, education, and skilling.\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## Introduction\n\n- 2.1 Indian  economy  has  undergone  a  transformative  process  of  New  Age  reforms  in  the last  eight  years.  These  diverse  policies  converge  towards  improving  the  economy's  overall efficiency and lifting its potential growth. To achieve the broader policy goal of unleashing the productive potential of the economy and its people, the reforms aimed at enhancing the ease of living and doing business at the fundamental level. The use of technology, in particular digital technology, undergirds the reforms. The economic energy and positive mindset that the reforms unleashed would have led to a sharp acceleration in growth but for the balance sheet repair of\n\nthe over-leveraged domestic financial sector (banking &amp; non-banking) and the corporate sector and secondarily to the one-off global shocks that followed.\n\n- 2.2 With the impetus of the persistent structural and governance reforms introduced in the country and strong macroeconomic stability, it is essential to get a handle on the medium-term growth outlook for India. Will the economy achieve and sustain a steady growth rate once the one-off shocks recede? This chapter attempts to answer this question and concludes that the chances of India growing at its potential and for the potential growth itself to be lifted are higher than it has been in the last two decades. The chapter starts with a brief discussion of the history of India's product and capital market reforms over the previous three decades. It further delves into the overarching philosophy behind the landmark reforms undertaken from 2014 to 2022 and elaborates on the shocks faced by the Indian economy during this period. It concludes with a discussion on the medium-term growth magnets for India.",
