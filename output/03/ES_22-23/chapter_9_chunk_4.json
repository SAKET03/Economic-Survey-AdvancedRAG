See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Indian industry sector contributes about 30% of the country's total gross value added (GVA) and has shown resilience in the face of global headwinds. In FY23, the industry faced challenges due to the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which led to a sharp rise in commodity prices. Despite this, the sector showed a modest growth of 4.1% in FY23, compared to 10.3% in FY22. The growth in industrial income has kept pace with overall GVA growth, with manufacturing GVA growing at a higher rate.\\n\\nThe industry sector provides employment to over 12.1 crore people and has direct and indirect linkages with other sectors, contributing to economic growth and employment. Industrial growth has multiplier effects, leading to employment growth, and some industries like textiles and construction have high employment elasticities.\\n\\nThe survey reviews the performance of the Indian industry in FY23, exploring demand stimulants to industrial growth, supply response, trends in credit to the industry, and foreign investment. The chapter also addresses developments in key sub-industries and their challenges.\\n\\nThe industry sector's growth is driven by robust domestic conditions, strong export performance, and increased investment demand. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23 was the highest since FY15. Exports of goods and services as a share of GDP have been the highest since FY16.\\n\\nThe increase in investment demand has emerged as a powerful stimulus to industrial growth, triggered by the augmented capex of the central government. The growth of eight core industries, including coal, fertilizers, cement, electricity, steel, and refinery products, has held steady, reflecting a broad momentum in industrial activity.\\n\\nThe electronics industry continues to ascend in importance, with India becoming the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer globally. The Indian pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticals industry, ranking 3rd worldwide in production by volume and 14th by value.\\n\\nThe government's Make-in-India initiative has facilitated investment, fostered innovation, and built world-class infrastructure. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes across 14 categories have further complemented it, with an estimated Capex of around â‚¹3 lakh crore over the next five years and the potential to generate over 60 lakh jobs.\\n\\nThe industry sector's growth has been supported by an upswing in bank credit, with credit to industry growing in double digits since July 2022. Credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase, assisted by the introduction of the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS).\\n\\nThe survey highlights the importance of the industry sector in the Indian economy and its potential to become a global manufacturing hub. The sector's growth is expected to be driven by strong domestic demand, investment revival, and export growth. However, the sector also faces challenges, including input cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and global economic uncertainty.\\n\\nThe government has implemented several measures to support the industry sector, including the PLI schemes, the Make-in-India initiative, and the ECLGS. The sector is expected to play a critical role in India's economic growth and its ambitions to become a key player in global value chains.\\n\\nThe Indian economy has made significant strides in internet penetration, which is a key requisite of Industry 4.0. The government is cognizant of the importance of Industry 4.0 in achieving the goals of Aatmanirbharta and its ambitions of becoming a key player in global value chains.\\n\\nThe Global Innovation Index (GII) ranks countries based on innovation performance, and India entered the top 40 innovating countries for the first time in 2022. India became the most innovative nation in the lower-middle-income group, overtaking Vietnam and leading the Central and Southern Asia region.\\n\\nThe 'Make in India' initiative has been striving to ensure that the business ecosystem in the nation is conducive for investors doing business in India. The reform measures include amendments to laws and liberalization of guidelines and regulations to reduce compliance burdens.\\n\\nThe DPIIT's Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2020 shows that 7,496 reforms were implemented across States and UTs, enhancing the Ease of Doing Business. Ministries and States/UTs have reduced more than 39,000 compliances, and over 3,500 provisions related to minor technical or procedural defaults have been decriminalized.\\n\\nThe National Single Window System (NSWS) was soft-launched in September 2021 to improve the ease of doing business by providing a single digital platform to investors for approvals and clearances. The portal has integrated multiple existing clearance systems of various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments.\\n\\nThe government's efforts towards fostering innovation include incubation, handholding, funding, industry-academia partnership, and mentorship. The government has strengthened its IPR regime by modernizing the IP office, reducing legal compliances, and facilitating IP filing for start-ups, women entrepreneurs, small industries, and others.\\n\\nThe start-up ecosystem in India has grown significantly, with over 48% of start-ups from Tier II & III cities. The government has given a major boost to start-ups through various initiatives, including the Start-up India Initiative, eligible companies getting recognized as Start-ups by DPIIT to access tax benefits, easier compliance, and IPR fast-tracking.\\n\\nThe 'Flipping' phenomenon, where Indian start-ups get headquartered overseas, has been observed, but the government has taken measures to encourage 'Reverse Flipping'. The measures include simplifying the process for grant of 'Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB) certification' for Start-ups, further simplification of taxation of Employee Stock Options (ESOPs), and simplifying multiple layers of tax and uncertainty due to tax litigation.\\n\\nOverall, the Indian industry sector has shown resilience and growth, driven by strong domestic demand, investment revival, and export growth. The sector is expected to play a critical role in India's economic growth and its ambitions to become a key player in global value chains.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Supply Response of Industry\n\n## Supply Response of Industry\n\n- 9.7 The supply  response  of  the  industry  to  the  demand  stimulus  has  been  robust,  as  seen in  high-frequency  indicators.  The  PMI-Manufacturing,  for  example,  has  remained  in  the expansionary zone for 18 months since July 2021. In December 2022, the sub-indices of the PMI-Manufacturing  indicated  an  easing  pace  of  input  cost  pressures,  improving  supplier delivery times, robust export orders, and future output. The moderation in input cost inflation has also led to an easing in the momentum of output prices. However, the pace of expansion in new export orders decreased, reflecting a subdued global demand.\n- 9.8 The sustained growth of manufacturing output is also seen within the overall IIP producing consumer  durables  in  sync  with  the  'pent-up'  consumption  demand.  Robust  growth  in  the production of capital goods and infrastructure/construction goods is indicative of the beginnings of an investment cycle in the private sector in the next financial year.\n\nFigure IX.2: PMI Manufacturing remains in expansionary zone\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure IX.3: Sub-indices of IIP growing at a healthy pace (apr-Nov)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: IHS Markit\n\nSource: MoSPI\n\n9.9 The eight core industries of coal, fertilisers, cement, steel, electricity, refinery products, crude oil, and natural gas are critical in meeting the demand for inputs across industries. The growth in these industries has held steady, reflecting a broad momentum in industrial activity. Their growth underscores the importance that nations have been attaching to the indigenous presence of core capacities in the aftermath of the pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict breaking down the global supply chain.\n\nFigure IX.4: Steady Growth in components of Index of core Industries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT)\n\n9.10 Growth in industrial output would have been higher, but for some constraints it faced in the first half of FY23. Seasonality has contributed to constraining the growth of production in respect of mining and quarrying, and construction, as total rainfall in Q2 of FY23 was about 12 per cent higher than in Q2 of FY22. Further, as higher rainfall cooled temperatures, electricity demand fell, and hence output rose by less than 5 per cent in Q2 of FY23 over Q2 of FY22.\n\nFigure IX.5: Gva construction (a proxy for construction output) constrained by Higher Rainfall\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: MoSPI\n\n9.11 Manufacturing output appears to have been constrained by a large build-up in inventory. For five consecutive quarters ending in Q2 of FY23, an increase in stocks had accumulated to more than 1.3 per cent of the annual GDP. A typical cycle of change-in-stocks juxtaposed with the growth of manufacturing GVA (a proxy for manufacturing output) suggests that the buildup of stock allows manufacturing to slow its pace with the accumulated stock meeting current demand. When stocks start shrinking, manufacturing output increases to meet current demand and replenish stocks before the onset of the next cycle. Stock build-up appears to have thus played an important role in keeping the growth of manufacturing output restrained in Q2.\n\nFigure IX.6: Gva Manufacturing slowing with build-up in stocks and elevated global uncertainty\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: MoSPI; Note: Change in stocks refers to change in stocks of GFCF.\n\n9.12 The  manufacturing  landscape  shows  uneven  growth  across  various  categories.  For example,  the  motor  vehicles  manufacturing  segment's  performance  continues  to  improve, induced by robust demand and an easing of chip shortage. The manufacturing of 'computer, electronic and optical products', an upcoming industry, has also been rising. Multiple players looking to make India a manufacturing hub of semiconductors have made the investment outlook\n\nin this sector positive. Production of coke and refined petroleum has also increased, fetching high returns in a global market where crude oil prices were higher than in FY22. Chemicals and chemical products such as caustic soda, soda ash, fertilisers and petroleum products have also performed well, contributing to sustaining the growth momentum in the agriculture sector while increasing exports. At the same time, a few product categories, including textiles, apparel and leather, have been showing tepid growth, as export demand for these products has been mellowing with the slowing of global output and demand. Growth in pharmaceutical output has slowed due to an unfavourable base effect and the waning of the pandemic.\n\nTable IX.2: Growth in Manufacturing Sectors (Per cent, YoY)\n\n|                                                            | <0      | >0 but <5   | >0 but <5   | >0 but <5   | >0 but <5   | >5      | >5      |         |         |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n|                                                            | Weights | apr- 22     | May- 22     | Jun- 22     | Jul- 22     | aug- 22 | Sep- 22 | oct- 22 | Nov- 22 |\n| Food Products                                              | 5.3     | 3.8         | 10.1        | 5.1         | -2.6        | 0.7     | 4.0     | -3.7    | 9.9     |\n| Beverages                                                  | 1       | 29.2        | 130.3       | 45.7        | 13.1        | 6.4     | 12.3    | 2.7     | 8.2     |\n| Tobacco Products                                           | 0.8     | 22          | 21.4        | 52.7        | -9.1        | -12.8   | -0.7    | -14.3   | -5.0    |\n| Textiles                                                   | 3.3     | -0.4        | 5.9         | -3.1        | -9.0        | -12.5   | -13.9   | -18.7   | -9.0    |\n| Wearing Apparel                                            | 1.3     | 55.2        | 69.9        | 42.6        | 15.1        | -18.3   | -21.6   | -36.6   | -11.7   |\n| Leather And Related Products                               | 0.5     | 5           | 47.5        | 1.9         | -13.5       | -16.0   | -17.5   | -25.5   | -2.0    |\n| WoodAnd Products Of WoodAnd Cork                           | 0.2     | 4.1         | 54.1        | 14.4        | 7.9         | -7.9    | -3.7    | -14.8   | -0.5    |\n| Paper And Paper Products                                   | 0.9     | -1.9        | 9.7         | 8.3         | -0.2        | -0.1    | 6.2     | -8.2    | -2.3    |\n| Printing and Reproduction Of Recorded Media                | 0.7     | 30.1        | 43          | 45.1        | 41.2        | 27.6    | 29.1    | 13.5    | 22.1    |\n| Coke And Refined Petroleum Products                        | 11.8    | 10.6        | 18.1        | 17.4        | 7.2         | 6.6     | 9.7     | -1.0    | -9.8    |\n| Chemicals And Chemical Products                            | 7.9     | 4.4         | 24.3        | 14.8        | 7.2         | 5.7     | 6.4     | -2.5    | 6.2     |\n| Pharmaceuticals, Medicinal Chemical And Botanical Products | 5       | -5.5        | -13.4       | -4.6        | -4.7        | -17.6   | -15.1   | -21.2   | 10.0    |\n| Rubber And Plastics Products                               | 2.4     | -1.5        | 8.7         | 5.7         | -2.2        | -4.4    | -2.8    | -2.1    | 5.6     |\n| Other Non-Metallic Mineral Products                        | 4.1     | 6.9         | 22.1        | 19.6        | 0.0         | 1.4     | 9.7     | -3.7    | 19.8    |\n| Basic Metals                                               | 12.8    | 6.9         | 16.5        | 7.2         | 6.7         | 4.0     | 5.7     | 4.4     | 8.1     |\n| Fabricated Metal Products,                                 | 2.7     | -0.4        | 29.2        | 14.3        | -4.1        | -14.4   | 14.6    | -11.8   | 8.2     |\n| Computer, Electronic And Optical Products                  | 1.6     | 6.3         | 28.7        | 43.8        | 2.8         | 3.3     | -0.2    | -11.8   | 3.0     |\n| Electrical Equipment                                       | 3       | 8.3         | 59.6        | 11          | -16.1       | -28.5   | -31.0   | -33.0   | 1.2     |\n| Machinery And Equipment N.E.C.                             | 4.8     | 5.4         | 38.8        | 19.9        | 4.1         | 2.9     | 6.4     | -7.2    | 20.8    |\n| Motor Vehicles, Trailers And Semi- Trailers                | 4.9     | 6.5         | 87.3        | 31.2        | 17.8        | 22.7    | 29.1    | 12.2    | 22.2    |\n\n|                           |   Weights |   apr- 22 |   May- 22 |   Jun- 22 |   Jul- 22 |   aug- 22 |   Sep- 22 |   oct- 22 |   Nov- 22 |\n|---------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Other Transport Equipment |       1.8 |      -1.5 |     126.6 |      36.2 |      -1.2 |       7.8 |      14.8 |      -8.1 |      24   |\n| Furniture                 |       0.1 |      59.3 |      73.7 |      31.8 |      32.4 |      44.1 |      30.3 |       6.4 |      15.7 |\n| Other manufacturing       |       0.9 |      -3.2 |      18.5 |      26.4 |       6.9 |       4.2 |       4.8 |     -31.1 |      13.1 |\n\nSource: MoSPI",
