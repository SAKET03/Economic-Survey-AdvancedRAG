  "content": "Chapter 8 Summary:\nThe agriculture and allied sector has been performing well, with an average annual growth rate of 4.6% over the last six years. In 2021-22, the sector grew by 3.0% compared to 3.3% in 2020-21. India has emerged as a net exporter of agricultural products, with exports reaching an all-time high of $50.2 billion in 2021-22. The government has taken measures to promote farmer-producer organizations, encourage crop diversification, and improve productivity in agriculture through support for mechanization and the creation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme has provided income support to farmers, leading to diversification in sources of farmers' income and improving their resilience to weather shocks. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) has been implemented to provide food security, with 81.4 crore beneficiaries receiving free foodgrains for one year from January 1, 2023. The government has also taken initiatives to enhance credit availability, facilitate mechanization, and boost horticulture and organic farming. The animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries sectors have been recognized as emerging sectors, with the government providing support for their development. The chapter discusses various policy initiatives, including the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure returns over the cost of production, and the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) to provide short-term credit to farmers at subsidized interest rates. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) has been introduced to provide hassle-free credit availability to farmers, with 3.89 crore KCCs issued as of December 30, 2022. The government has also promoted organic farming, with 44.3 lakh organic farmers and 59.1 lakh hectares of area brought under organic farming by 2021-22. The chapter highlights the importance of the agriculture sector in India's growth and development, with a focus on sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nSubchapter 8 Content:\n# Allied Sectors: Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries Catching up in Recent Years\n\n## Allied sectors: Animal Husbandry, dairying and Fisheries catching up in recent years\n\n8.18  The  allied  sectors  of  Indian  agriculture  -  livestock,  forestry  &amp;  logging  and  fishing  &amp; aquaculture are gradually becoming sectors of buoyant growth and a potential source of better farm incomes. The livestock sector grew at a CAGR of 7.9 per cent during 2014-15 to 202021 (at constant prices), and its contribution to total agriculture GVA (at constant prices) has increased  from  24.3  per  cent  in  2014-15  to  30.1  per  cent  in  2020-21.  Similarly,  the  annual average growth rate of the fisheries sector has been about 7 per cent since 2016-17 and has a share of about 6.7 per cent in total agriculture GVA. Higher growth in allied sectors compared to the crop sector has obvious implications in terms of the increasing importance of the former in total agricultural GV A. Recognising the growing importance of allied sectors, the Committee on Doubling Farmers' Income (DFI, 2018) considers dairying, livestock, poultry, fisheries and horticulture as high-growth engines and has recommended a focussed policy with a concomitant support system for the allied sector.\n\nFigure VIII.7: though the crop sector is still the major contributor to agriculture gVA, the livestock sector is catching up (per cent)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Based on data of MoSPI.\n\n8.19  The dairy sector is the most critical component of the livestock sector, employing more than eight crore farmers directly, and is the most prominent agrarian product. Other livestock products, such as eggs and meat, are also growing in importance. While India ranks first in milk production in the world, it ranks third in egg production and eighth in meat production in the world.\n\n8.20  Cognisant of the importance of allied sectors, the Government has made several critical interventions to enhance infrastructure and improve livestock productivity and disease control. As  a  part  of  the  Aatmanirbhar  Bharat  (ANB)  stimulus  package,  the  Animal  Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund (AHIDF) worth ₹15,000 crore was launched in 2020. Under this scheme, the Central Government provides a 3 per cent interest subvention to the borrower and credit guarantees up to 25 per cent of total borrowing. As of 14 October 2022, 116 projects have  been  approved  under  the  scheme  involving  project  costs  of  ₹3,731.4  crore.  National Livestock Mission (NLM) scheme has been restructured for 2021-22 to 2025-26. The scheme focuses  on  entrepreneurship  development  and  breeds  improvement  in  poultry,  sheep,  goat and piggery, including feed and fodder development. Also, the Livestock Health and Disease Control (LH&amp;DC) Scheme is being implemented to supplement the State/UT governments' efforts towards preventing, controlling and containing animal diseases of economic and zoonotic importance by vaccination. National Animal Disease Control Programme (NADCP) is being implemented to control Foot &amp; Mouth Disease and Brucellosis by completely vaccinating cattle, buffalo,  sheep,  goat  and  pig  populations  against  Foot  &amp;  Mouth  Disease  and  bovine  female calves of 4-8 months of age against brucellosis.\n\n8.21  In May 2020, as a part of the ANB package, the Government of India launched its flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), with a total outlay of ₹20,050 crore. PMMSY marks the highest-ever investment in the fisheries sector in India, to be implemented over  five  years  from  FY21  to  FY25  in  all  States/Union  Territories  to  drive  sustainable  and responsible development of the fisheries sector while ensuring socio-economic development of the fishers, fish farmers and fish workers. Before this, attention had been paid to addressing infrastructure gaps in the fisheries sector. A dedicated Fisheries and Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) was established for five years, from 2018-19 to 2022-23, with an investment of ₹7,522 crore. Under the FIDF, as of 17 October 2022, proposals to the tune of ₹4,923.9 crore have been approved and have benefitted over 9.4 lakh persons, through direct and indirect employment, in fishing and allied activities.\n\n## sahakar-se-samriddhi: From cooperation to Prosperity\n\n8.22  The cooperative societies, especially in the agriculture, dairy and fisheries sectors, provide the rural population with livelihood opportunities and a financial safety net with a communitybased approach. Cooperatives hold the key to rural economic transformation.  There are 8.5 lakh registered cooperatives in the country, having more than 29 crore members mainly from the marginalised and lower-income groups in the rural areas, and 98 per cent of villages are covered by Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS).\n\n8.23  To realise the vision of 'Sahakar-see-Samriddhi', a renewed impetus was given to the growth of the cooperative sector. Currently, around 19 per cent of agriculture finance is through\n\ncooperative societies. A full-fledged Ministry of Cooperation was established in July 2021 to provide greater focus to the cooperative sector. In addition, the Government has taken various initiatives to promote and strengthen PACS, like the computerisation of 63,000 functional PACS and the preparation of by-laws for enabling PACS to expand their activities.\n\n8.24  The  Multi-State  Cooperative  Societies Act,  2002  (MSCS)  was  enacted  after  repealing the Multi-State Cooperative Act 1984, to facilitate the democratic functioning and autonomous working of Multi-State Cooperative Societies in line with the established Cooperative Principles. As of date, there are 1528 registered societies under the Multi-State Cooperative Societies Act 2002. The MSCSs include 66 Multi-State Cooperative Banks with deposits of approx. ₹2.6 lakh crore. Maharashtra leads 661 cooperatives, followed by Delhi and Uttar Pradesh.\n\nFigure VIII.8: top ten states with Multi-state cooperative societies as on 20 october 2022\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Box VIII.3:   new national cooperation Policy\n\nWith the view to strengthening the cooperative movement in the country, deepening its reach to the grassroots, and promoting cooperative-based economic development, a New National Cooperation Policy is being formulated involving the relevant stakeholders such as experts of the cooperative sector, representatives from National/ State/ District/ Primary level cooperative societies, Secretaries (Cooperation) and Resident Commissioners from States/UTs, officers from Central Ministries/ Departments. The objective is to have a policy that unlocks the true potential of the Cooperation sector.\n\nIn  addition,  the  Government  has  also  decided  to  introduce  the  Multi-State  Co-operative Societies  (Amendment)  Bill,  2022. The  Bill  seeks  to  amend  the  Multi-State  Co-operative Societies Act, 2002, to bring it in line with Part IXB of the Constitution and to strengthen the  cooperative  movement  in  the  country  by  bringing  in  provisions  relating  to  electoral reforms,  strengthening  governance  and  transparency,  reforming  the  composition,  meetings and membership of board; enabling the raising of funds by co-operative sector, strengthening monitoring mechanism, enhancing 'Ease of doing business', etc. The bill was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 7 December 2022 in the winter session of Parliament.",
