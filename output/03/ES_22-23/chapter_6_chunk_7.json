It connects the Government and the individual, replacing the disentangled web of multiple IDs for multiple purposes, and secures the social contract between the State and the Citizen. It is because of the initiative taken in 2010 that today, the nation is consistently building and strengthening a digital economy which will ultimately give a global competitive advantage in how money and goods move around the country over its competitors.\n\n6.22 Paul Romer, a Nobel laureate and former World Bank Chief Economist, has described what 135 crore citizens of India, which is 94 per cent of the population and 100 per cent of the adult (&gt;18 years), have as 'the most sophisticated ID programme in the world.' 11 Aadhaar provides  a  conclusive  connection  between  the  photograph  of  the  Aadhaar  holder,  his/her fingerprints, and iris scan details.\n\n## achievements of aadhaar\n\n6.23 Aadhaar is an essential tool for social delivery by the State. 318 Central schemes and over 720 state DBT schemes are notified under section 7 of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and all these schemes use Aadhaar for targeted delivery of financial services, subsidies, and benefits. Aadhaar is the foundation of India's digital integration, as shown by the following statistics (as of November 2022):\n\n- Aadhaar Generated- 135.2 crore\n\n11 ''Adhaar' most sophisticated ID programme in the world: World Bank'. Daiji World , Quoted from an interview with Bloomberg.\n\n- Aadhaar Updated- 71.1 crore\n- Authentication Done- 8621.2 crore\n- eKYC Done-1350.2 crore\n- 75.3 crore residents have linked their Aadhaar with ration cards to avail of ration\n- 27.9 crore residents linked Aadhaar with cooking gas connection for LPG subsidy\n- 75.4 crore bank accounts are linked with Aadhaar &amp; 1549.8 crore transactions via Aadhaar Enabled Payment Systems\n- 6.24 The key usages of Aadhaar in the daily lives of citizens are:\n- Aadhaar - Usage in DBT : When linked with a bank account, an Aadhaar becomes the 'Financial  Address'  of  an  individual,  which  helps  to  accomplish  the  country's  goal  of financial inclusion. The number is sufficient to transfer any payment to an individual's bank account through Aadhaar Payment Bridge (APB), thus eliminating the need to give other details,  viz.  the  bank  account,  IFSC  Code,  and  bank  branch  details  to  the  Government/ Institutions.\n- Aadhaar Enabled Payment Systems (AEPS): AEPS helps an individual to do basic banking transactions, viz. withdrawal, cash deposit, transfer of funds from his bank account, etc., by simply using his Aadhaar. This has immensely facilitated providing door-step banking services and helped mitigate the hardships of the people due to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n- JAM (Jan-Dhan, Aadhaar, and Mobile ) trinity,  combined  with  the  power  of  DBT,  has brought the marginalised sections of society into the formal financial system, revolutionising the path of transparent and accountable governance by empowering the people. Till November 2022, multiple large central schemes, including PAHAL, MGNREGS, etc., have paid over ` 7,66,055.9 crore through over 1,010 crore successful transactions. 12\n- One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) Scheme : Aadhaar has played a key role in the implementation  of  the  ONORC  Scheme.  While  Aadhaar  seeding  of  the  PDS  database has  resulted  in  significant  savings  due  to  eliminating  ghost  and  duplicate  beneficiaries. Grain disbursal through Aadhaar-based Biometric Authentication has brought meaningful transparency and back-office improvement of the logistic network of PDS. Free distribution of food grains under 'Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana' (PMGKY) has greatly mitigated the Covid pandemic's impact, especially for the weakest and most vulnerable sections of society.\n- PM Kisan Samman Nidhi: Aadhaar platform forms the backbone for the implementation of this scheme, right from registration through Aadhaar eKYC to DBT through the APB.\n- Co-WIN: Successful management of the Covid pandemic without the Co-WIN platform would  not  have  been  possible.  Aadhaar  played  a  vital  role  in  developing  the  Co-WIN platform and in the transparent administration of over 2 billion vaccine doses.\n\n12  Source: National Payments Coporation of India.\n\n- Face  Authentication: The  use  of  face  as  an  additional  modality  of  authentication  is increasing. This  has  helped,  especially  the  elderly,  to  get  'Jeevan  Praman'  through  their smartphones to avail of pension.\n\n## the aadhaar ecosystem\n\n6.25 The  Unique  Identification  Authority  of  India  (UIDAI)  is  mandated  to  develop  the policy, procedure, and system for issuing an Aadhaar number to each resident individual and performing authentication. It also has the responsibility to take necessary measures to ensure that  the  information  stored  in  the  Central  Identities  Data  Repository  (CIDR)  is  secured  and protected against unauthorised access or misuse. The ecosystem required for the purpose now consists of the following (as of 30 November 2022):\n\n- 66,103 Aadhaar counters and 34,834 Child Enrolment Lite Client devices are functional\n- 180 Active Registrars\n- 507 Active Enrolment Agencies\n- UIDAI run 88 Aadhaar Sewa Kendra are functional in 72 cities\n- 15,002 Village Level Entrepreneurs operational as Banking Correspondents permitted to undertake Aadhaar updates services\n- Around 53,750 postmen/Grameen Dak Sewaks under India Post Payment Bank have been approved to provide mobile number update facility\n- 178Aadhaar User Agencies\n- 169 e-KYC user agencies",
