  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nThe year 2022 marked the return of high inflation, especially in advanced economies, after nearly four decades. Inflation did not spare emerging economies either. Major central banks implemented sharp increases in policy rates, with the Federal Reserve's rate hikes being the steepest since the 1970s. The RBI initiated its monetary tightening cycle in April 2022 and has since implemented a policy repo rate hike of 225 basis points. Consequently, domestic financial conditions began to tighten, reflected in the lower growth of monetary aggregates. The change in RBI's policy stance in FY23 led to a moderation of surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed during the pandemic years. Monetary policy transmission is well underway as lending and deposit rates increased following the hike in policy rates. In the government securities (G-sec) market, bond yields were on an upward trajectory until June 2022 and moderated in November and December 2022. The global tightening cycle contributed to a dampened global outlook, but the domestic appetite for credit has been on an upswing. Non-food credit offtake by scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) has been growing in double digits since April 2022. Credit disbursed by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) has also been on the rise. The balance sheet clean-up exercise has been vital in enhancing the lending ability of financial institutions. The Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.0%, while the Capital-to-Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) remains healthy at 16.0%. The health of NBFCs has continued to improve as well. Political and economic developments in 2022 led to increased volatility in capital markets around the world. However, domestic capital markets displayed some encouraging trends. The primary equity markets witnessed participation from all segments, especially with increased Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contributions. The secondary capital market indices performed better than their peers between April and December 2022. Net FPI flows turned positive in the quarter ending December 2022. The indices have displayed a decreasing trend in volatility as measured by the India Volatility Index (VIX) over this period. Insurance penetration in India has been steadily increasing, with life insurance penetration being above the emerging markets and global averages. India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. The pension sector has also been taking rapid strides since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The sector has witnessed a robust increase in the number of subscribers and assets under management (AuM). As global central banks reaffirm their hawkish stances and telegraph 'higher-for-longer' policy rates, monetary conditions are expected to remain tight worldwide. Domestically, RBI's support to growth will ensure adequate liquidity in financial markets. The growth in credit offtake is expected to sustain, and combined with a pick-up in private Capex, will usher in a virtuous investment cycle.\n\nSubchapter 3 Content:\n# Monetary Policy Transmission\n\n## Monetary Policy transmission\n\n4.9 Lending and deposit rates of banks increased during FY23 in consonance with the policy repo rate changes. During FY23 (up to December 2022), external benchmark-based lending rate and 1-year median marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) increased by 225 bps and 115 bps, respectively. Overall, the weighted average lending rate (WALR) on fresh and outstanding rupee loans rose by 135 bps and 71 bps, respectively, in FY23 (up to November 2022). On the deposit side, the weighted average domestic term deposit rate (WADTDR) on outstanding deposits increased by 59 bps in FY23 (up to November 2022).\n\nFigure IV.4: Transmission to domestic lending and deposit rates picking up\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI\n\n4.10  An  analysis  of  transmission  across  bank  groups  during  FY23  (up  to  November  2022) indicates that the increase in the WALRs on fresh loans was higher in the case of public sector banks, while that of the WADTDR on outstanding deposits and WALR on outstanding loans was higher for private banks.\n\nTable IV.2: Transmission to lending and deposit rates across bank groups\n\n| Variation in bps   | february 2019 - March 2022     | february 2019 - March 2022   | february 2019 - March 2022    | april to november 2022         | april to november 2022   | april to november 2022        |\n|--------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|\n|                    | Walr - outstanding rupee loans | Walr - fresh rupee loans     | Wadtdr - outstanding deposits | Walr - outstanding rupee loans | Walr - fresh rupee loans | Wadtdr - outstanding deposits |\n| PSBs               | -153                           | -252                         | -169                          | 59                             | 149                      | 51                            |\n| PVBs               | -141                           | -188                         | -211                          | 82                             | 101                      | 59                            |\n| SCBs#              | -150                           | -232                         | -188                          | 71                             | 135                      | 59                            |\n\n- ^: March 31, 2017 over April 1, 2016, barring M0, CiC and Bankers' Deposits with the RBI.\n- *: Data for FY23 is as on December 30, 2022\n\n## Source: RBI\n\nNote: WALR: Weighted Average Lending Rate; WADTDR: Weighted Average Domestic Term Deposit Rate.\n\nMCLR: Marginal Cost of funds-based Lending Rate;\n\n# SCBs include public, private and foreign banks.\n\nPSBs: Public Sector Banks\n\nPVBs: Private Banks",
