  "content": "Chapter 8 Summary:\nThe agriculture and allied sector has been performing well, with an average annual growth rate of 4.6% over the last six years. In 2021-22, the sector grew by 3.0% compared to 3.3% in 2020-21. India has emerged as a net exporter of agricultural products, with exports reaching an all-time high of $50.2 billion in 2021-22. The government has taken measures to promote farmer-producer organizations, encourage crop diversification, and improve productivity in agriculture through support for mechanization and the creation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme has provided income support to farmers, leading to diversification in sources of farmers' income and improving their resilience to weather shocks. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) has been implemented to provide food security, with 81.4 crore beneficiaries receiving free foodgrains for one year from January 1, 2023. The government has also taken initiatives to enhance credit availability, facilitate mechanization, and boost horticulture and organic farming. The animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries sectors have been recognized as emerging sectors, with the government providing support for their development. The chapter discusses various policy initiatives, including the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure returns over the cost of production, and the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) to provide short-term credit to farmers at subsidized interest rates. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) has been introduced to provide hassle-free credit availability to farmers, with 3.89 crore KCCs issued as of December 30, 2022. The government has also promoted organic farming, with 44.3 lakh organic farmers and 59.1 lakh hectares of area brought under organic farming by 2021-22. The chapter highlights the importance of the agriculture sector in India's growth and development, with a focus on sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nSubchapter 3 Content:\n# MSP to Ensure Returns Over the Cost of Production\n\n## MsP to ensure returns over the cost of Production\n\n8.4 The Union Budget for 2018-19 announced that farmers in India would be given an MSP of at least one and a half times the cost of production. Accordingly, the Government has been increasing the MSP for all 22 Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a margin of at least 50 per cent over the all-India weighted average cost of production since the agricultural year 2018-19. Given nutritional requirements and changing dietary patterns and to achieve selfsufficiency in pulses and oilseeds production, the Government has fixed relatively higher MSP for pulses and oilseeds.\n\nFigure VIII.5: Minimum Support Price for selected Kharif and Rabi Crops (â‚¹/Quintal)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Based on data of DAFW and CACP.",
