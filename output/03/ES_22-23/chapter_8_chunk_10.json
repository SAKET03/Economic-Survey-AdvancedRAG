In 2021-22, the sector grew by 3.0% compared to 3.3% in 2020-21. India has emerged as a net exporter of agricultural products, with exports reaching an all-time high of $50.2 billion in 2021-22. The government has taken measures to promote farmer-producer organizations, encourage crop diversification, and improve productivity in agriculture through support for mechanization and the creation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme has provided income support to farmers, leading to diversification in sources of farmers' income and improving their resilience to weather shocks. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) has been implemented to provide food security, with 81.4 crore beneficiaries receiving free foodgrains for one year from January 1, 2023. The government has also taken initiatives to enhance credit availability, facilitate mechanization, and boost horticulture and organic farming. The animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries sectors have been recognized as emerging sectors, with the government providing support for their development. The chapter discusses various policy initiatives, including the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure returns over the cost of production, and the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) to provide short-term credit to farmers at subsidized interest rates. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) has been introduced to provide hassle-free credit availability to farmers, with 3.89 crore KCCs issued as of December 30, 2022. The government has also promoted organic farming, with 44.3 lakh organic farmers and 59.1 lakh hectares of area brought under organic farming by 2021-22. The chapter highlights the importance of the agriculture sector in India's growth and development, with a focus on sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nSubchapter 10 Content:\n# Conclusion\n\n## conclusion\n\n8.36  The  performance  of  the  agriculture  sector  remains  critical  to  growth  and  employment in  the  country.  Investment  in  the  sector  must  be  encouraged  through  an  affordable,  timely and inclusive approach to credit delivery. Intervention by the Government through PM Kisan to  provide  income  support,  strengthening  of  institutional  finance  and  insurance  through  the PMFBY and the push given to Kisan Credit Cards as also access to machines and tools that improve productivity have been significant. A focus on the horticulture sector and the thrust towards allied activities have diversified farmers' income making them more resilient to weather shocks. All these initiatives have led to sustainable and inclusive development of the sector.\n\n8.37  A greater focus on the development of the food processing sector can reduce wastage/ loss and increase the length of storage, ensuring better prices for the farmers. The initiatives like  e-NAM  and  the  Promotion  of  FPOs  formation  have  been  introduced  to  strengthen  the agricultural market. With the interventions including PMKSY, PMFME, PLI, etc., attempts have been made to boost the food processing industries to harness its linkages with the agriculture sector. A well-developed food processing sector with improved infrastructure like cold storage and better logistics helps reduce wastage, improve value addition, ensure better farmers' returns, promote employment, and increase export earnings.",
