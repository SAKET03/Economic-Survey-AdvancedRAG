See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"Climate change is primarily attributed to disproportionately high cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from developed countries. India has contributed only about 4% to cumulative global emissions and maintains its per capita emission at far less than the world average. Despite being less responsible for emissions, India is committed to a low-emission growth pathway with a net-zero emissions goal by 2070.\\n\\nIndia has integrated development goals with ambitious climate action goals, including increasing solar power capacity, energy saving targets, and improving green cover. The country has achieved its target of 40% installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuels ahead of 2030 and has advanced the target to 50%. The National Hydrogen Mission and Green Hydrogen Policy have been introduced to enable India to be energy independent by 2047.\\n\\nThe country has updated its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in line with the Prime Minister's vision, focusing on sustainable lifestyles and climate justice. India aims to reduce its emissions intensity by 45% by 2030 and achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources.\\n\\nIndia's climate actions have been largely financed from domestic sources, but the country needs tens of trillions of US dollars to achieve its climate goals. The government has scaled up efforts to mobilize private capital, including through sovereign green bonds. A framework for green bonds has been issued, complying with International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles.\\n\\nThe country's climate vision is linked to its development goals, including poverty eradication and basic well-being for all citizens. India launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008, establishing eight National Missions. The country has made significant progress on these missions, including increasing solar power capacity and improving energy efficiency.\\n\\nIndia's updated NDC includes eight goals, three of which are quantitative targets to be achieved by 2030. The targets include cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources reaching 40%, reduction in emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35%, and creation of additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\\n\\nThe country aims to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. India's forest and tree cover have shown a steady increase, with a carbon stock of 7,204 million tonnes in 2019. The country has 75 Ramsar sites covering 13.3 lakh ha and has increased its mangrove cover by 364 sq. km.\\n\\nIndia has implemented various measures to conserve and protect the environment, including the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The country has also launched initiatives such as Project Cheetah, the world's first intercontinental large wild carnivore translocation project.\\n\\nIndia has committed to mitigating pollution caused by littered single-use plastics and has banned the manufacture, import, and use of identified single-use plastic items. The country has also notified guidelines on Extended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging and has implemented the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021.\\n\\nThe government has published the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, and the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, to ensure environmentally sound management of waste batteries and e-waste. India aims to promote a circular economy, reduce plastic footprint, and develop new alternatives to plastic packaging.\\n\\nThe country has made significant progress on its climate goals, including enhancing its non-fossil fuel-based installed capacity target to 50%. India has also evolved its sustainable finance framework, extending the requirement to 1,000 top listed companies on a mandatory basis. The country needs to dedicate resources to climate change, in addition to its development goals. Obligations on climate should be matched with on-time availability of climate finance, technology, and inputs like critical minerals.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# India's Initiatives at the International Stage\n\n## india's initiatives at the international Stage\n\n## international Solar alliance (iSa)\n\n7.62  The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation working to create a global market system to tap the benefits of solar power and promote clean energy applications. ISA's mission is to unlock US$ 1 trillion of investments in solar by 2030 while reducing the cost of the technology and its financing. With the signing and ratification of the ISA Framework Agreement by 15 countries on 6 December 2017, ISA became the first international intergovernmental organisation to be headquartered in India.  ISA is partnering with multilateral development banks (MDBs), development financial institutions (DFIs), private and public sector organisations, civil society, and other international institutions to deploy costeffective and transformational solutions through solar energy, especially in the least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the Small Island Developing States (SIDS).\n\n7.63  The ISA has expanded its coverage to all its 110 member countries. It assists them with the adoption of solar energy with the view to improving energy access, ensuring energy security and facilitating the energy transition. Through the programmatic support offered by ISA, a pipeline of 9.5 GW of solar energy capacity has been identified in its member countries, including largescale  solar  parks  in  multiple  developing  countries.  In  its  member  countries,  with  a  grant  of US$ 50,000, ISA is  assisting  in  setting  up  solar  energy  demonstration  projects.  Three  such demonstration projects were inaugurated at the Fifth Assembly of ISA.\n\n## Coalition for disaster resilient infrastructure\n\n7.64  The CDRI was launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India during the United Nations Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019 in New York. It is a global partnership of National Governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks and financing mechanisms, the private sector, and academic and knowledge institutions. It aims to promote the resilience of infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks, thereby ensuring sustainable development.\n\n7.65  As  on  29  June  2022,  thirty-one  Countries,  six  International  Organisations  and  two private sector organisations have joined as members of CDRI.  CDRI has been expanding its membership  consistently  by  attracting  a  wide  variety  of  economically  advanced  countries, developing countries, and countries that are most vulnerable to climate change and disasters. Over a period, a network of organisations/stakeholders will be developed to advance disasterresilient infrastructure not only in India but in other partner countries as well.\n\n## leadership group for industry transition (leadit)\n\n7.66  The LeadIT gathers countries and companies that are committed to action to achieve the Paris Agreement. It was launched by the governments of Sweden and India at the UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019 and is supported by the World Economic Forum. LeadIT members subscribe to the notion that energy-intensive industries can and must progress on lowcarbon pathways, aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.\n\n7.67  During COP 27, LeadIT members adopted a joint statement wherein members collectively agreed to:\n\n- (i) promote value chain partnerships and material circularity;\n- (ii) invest  and  cooperate  on  the  planning  and  implementation  of  infrastructure  to  support energy and industry transitions;\n- (iii) give multilateral development banks and multilateral climate funds mandates to de-risk investments in the transition of heavy industries in emerging and developing countries;\n- (iv) formulate  roadmaps  for  heavy  industry  sectors  that  include  regulatory  frameworks, incentives,  and  long-term  strategies,  to  facilitate  transition  finance  and  attract  private investments.",
