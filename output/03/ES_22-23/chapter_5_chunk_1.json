The consumer price inflation in India went through three phases in 2022: a rising phase up to April 2022, a holding pattern at around 7.0% up to August 2022, and a decline to around 5.7% by December 2022.\\n\\n### Inflation Phases\\n\\n* The rising phase was largely due to the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war and a shortfall in crop harvests due to excessive heat in some parts of the country.\\n* Prompt and adequate measures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have reined in the rise in inflation and brought it within the Central Bank's tolerance limit.\\n\\n### Comparison with Western Countries\\n\\n* In contrast, major Western countries, which pumped stimulus during the pandemic periods, continue to grapple with high levels of inflation.\\n\\n### Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI)\\n\\n* The divergence between a relatively high WPI inflation and lower CPI inflation widened in May 2022, primarily owing to a difference in relative weights of the two indices and the lagged effect of imported input costs on retail prices.\\n* However, the gap between the two measures of inflation has reduced since then, demonstrating a tendency towards convergence.\\n\\n### Core Inflation\\n\\n* An important measure of demand-pull inflation - core inflation - remains sticky.\\n* There have been significant variations in retail inflation rates among the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India.\\n\\n### Housing Price Index (HPI)\\n\\n* According to Housing Price Index (HPI) published by National Housing Bank (NHB), the overall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market price in Quarter Ending (QE) September 2022 over QE September 2021 indicates a revival in the housing finance sector.\\n\\n### Monetary Policy\\n\\n* RBI's Monetary Policy Committee increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 225 basis points from 4.0% to 6.25% between May and December 2022.\\n* Central Government has undertaken fiscal measures like reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, prohibition of the export of wheat products, imposition of export duty on rice, reduction in import duties and cess on pulses, rationalisation of tariffs and imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds, maintenance of buffer stock for onion and pulses and rationalisation of import duties on raw materials used in the manufactured products.\\n\\n### Inflation Forecast\\n\\n* The RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term, owing to supply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike, reflecting high feed costs.\\n* In general, climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to food prices.\\n\\n### Key Policy Recommendations\\n\\n* The government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices.\\n* India's retail inflation rate peaked at 7.8% in April 2022. The overshoot of inflation above the upper end of the target range in India was one of the lowest in the world.\\n\\n### Findings\\n\\n* The year 2022 was marked by a return of high inflation in the advanced world after three to four decades, depending on the country.\\n* In India, the government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices.\\n\\n### Retail Inflation\\n\\n* Retail inflation was mainly driven by higher food inflation, while core inflation stayed at a moderate level.\\n* Food inflation ranged between 4.2% to 8.6% between April and December 2022, while the core inflation rate stayed at around 6% except in April 2022.\\n\\n### Food Inflation\\n\\n* Food inflation based on Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) climbed to 7.0% in FY23 from 3.8% in FY22.\\n* The major contributors to food inflation are vegetables, cereals, milk, and spices.\\n\\n### Rural-Urban Inflation Differential\\n\\n* Rural inflation has remained above its urban counterpart throughout the current fiscal year, reversing the trend seen during the pandemic years.\\n\\n### Wholesale Price Inflation\\n\\n* WPI-based inflation remained low during the Covid-19 period and started to gain momentum in the post-pandemic period as economic activities resumed.\\n* The wholesale inflation rate climbed to about 13.0% in FY22.\\n\\n### Convergence of WPI and CPI Inflation\\n\\n* The headline inflation based on WPI and the CPI-C started diverging in March 2021, as WPI inflation touched double digits due to unfavourable base effects while CPI-C inflation remained stable.\\n* The gap began to narrow until April 2022. The path to convergence, however, was short-lived as another inflationary pressure started building up in February 2022.\\n\\n### Inflationary Expectations\\n\\n* Inflationary expectations are decisive in charting the course of inflation.\\n* The RBI's anchoring of inflationary expectations through forward guidance and responsive monetary policy has helped guide the trajectory of inflation in the country.\\n\\n### Housing Prices\\n\\n* Housing prices provide helpful information on the state of the economy via booms and busts in asset markets, which give rise to economic imbalances.\\n* Monitoring housing prices is essential for achieving the objectives of price stability, financial stability, and growth.\\n\\n### Pharmaceutical Prices\\n\\n* The principles for the regulation of the prices of drugs are based on the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Policy, 2012, administered by the Department of Pharmaceuticals.\\n* The key principles of the policy are the essentiality of drugs, control of formulation prices, and market-based pricing.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\n* It is not wishful thinking that 2023 will show less macroeconomic volatility than its preceding financial year.\\n* Both CPI-C and WPI have fallen below 6% (which is the RBI tolerance limit for the former) and are on the descending slope of the surge that hit the economy in the first half of the current fiscal.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# Prices and Inflation: Successful Tight-Rope Walking\n\n## Prices and inflation: successful tight-roPe Walking\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nConsumer price inflation in India went through three phases in 2022. A rising phase up to April 2022 when it crested at 7.8 per cent, then a holding pattern at around 7.0 per cent up to August 2022 and then a decline to around 5.7 per cent by December 2022. The rising phase was largely due to the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war and a shortfall in crop harvests due to excessive heat in some parts of the country. Prompt and adequate measures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have reined in the rise in inflation and brought it within the Central Bank's tolerance limit. In contrast, major Western countries, which pumped stimulus during the pandemic periods, continue to grapple with high levels of inflation.\n\nThe  divergence  between  a  relatively  high  Wholesale  Price  Index  (WPI)  inflation  and lower Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation widened in May 2022 primarily owing to a difference in relative weights of the two indices and the lagged effect of imported input costs on retail prices. However, the gap between the two measures of inflation has reduced since  then,  demonstrating  a  tendency  towards  convergence.  An  important  measure of  demand-pull  inflation  -  core  inflation  -  remains  sticky.  There  have  been  significant variations in retail inflation rates among the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India.\n\nAccording to Housing Price Index (HPI) published by National Housing Bank (NHB), the overall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market price in Quarter Ending (QE) September 2022 over QE September 2021 indicates a revival in the housing finance sector.\n\nRBI's  Monetary  Policy  Committee  increased  the  policy  repo  rate  under  the  liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 225 basis points from 4.0 per cent to 6.25 per cent between May and December 2022. Central Government has undertaken fiscal measures like reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, prohibition of the export of wheat products, imposition of export duty on rice, reduction in import duties and cess on pulses, rationalisation of tariffs and imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds, maintenance of buffer stock for onion and pulses and rationalisation of import duties on raw materials used in the manufactured products.\n\nThe RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term, owing to supply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike, reflecting high feed costs. In general, climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to food prices. A lot depends on industrial input prices: they may ease, but\n\non the flip  side,  their  delayed  pass-through  to  consumer  prices  may  contribute  to  the stickiness of core inflation.\n\nIn general, the year 2022 was marked by a return of high inflation in the advanced world after three to four decades, depending on the country. In India, the government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices. India's retail inflation rate peaked at 7.8 per cent in April 2022. The overshoot of inflation above the upper end of the target range in India was one of the lowest in the world. We are confident that authorities would remain vigilant and be as proactive as they were in 2022 should inflation pressures re-emerge in India in 2023.",
