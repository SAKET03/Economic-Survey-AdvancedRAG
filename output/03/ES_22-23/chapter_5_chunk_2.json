The consumer price inflation in India went through three phases in 2022: a rising phase up to April 2022, a holding pattern at around 7.0% up to August 2022, and a decline to around 5.7% by December 2022.\\n\\n### Inflation Phases\\n\\n* The rising phase was largely due to the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war and a shortfall in crop harvests due to excessive heat in some parts of the country.\\n* Prompt and adequate measures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have reined in the rise in inflation and brought it within the Central Bank's tolerance limit.\\n\\n### Comparison with Western Countries\\n\\n* In contrast, major Western countries, which pumped stimulus during the pandemic periods, continue to grapple with high levels of inflation.\\n\\n### Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI)\\n\\n* The divergence between a relatively high WPI inflation and lower CPI inflation widened in May 2022, primarily owing to a difference in relative weights of the two indices and the lagged effect of imported input costs on retail prices.\\n* However, the gap between the two measures of inflation has reduced since then, demonstrating a tendency towards convergence.\\n\\n### Core Inflation\\n\\n* An important measure of demand-pull inflation - core inflation - remains sticky.\\n* There have been significant variations in retail inflation rates among the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India.\\n\\n### Housing Price Index (HPI)\\n\\n* According to Housing Price Index (HPI) published by National Housing Bank (NHB), the overall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market price in Quarter Ending (QE) September 2022 over QE September 2021 indicates a revival in the housing finance sector.\\n\\n### Monetary Policy\\n\\n* RBI's Monetary Policy Committee increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 225 basis points from 4.0% to 6.25% between May and December 2022.\\n* Central Government has undertaken fiscal measures like reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, prohibition of the export of wheat products, imposition of export duty on rice, reduction in import duties and cess on pulses, rationalisation of tariffs and imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds, maintenance of buffer stock for onion and pulses and rationalisation of import duties on raw materials used in the manufactured products.\\n\\n### Inflation Forecast\\n\\n* The RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term, owing to supply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike, reflecting high feed costs.\\n* In general, climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to food prices.\\n\\n### Key Policy Recommendations\\n\\n* The government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices.\\n* India's retail inflation rate peaked at 7.8% in April 2022. The overshoot of inflation above the upper end of the target range in India was one of the lowest in the world.\\n\\n### Findings\\n\\n* The year 2022 was marked by a return of high inflation in the advanced world after three to four decades, depending on the country.\\n* In India, the government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices.\\n\\n### Retail Inflation\\n\\n* Retail inflation was mainly driven by higher food inflation, while core inflation stayed at a moderate level.\\n* Food inflation ranged between 4.2% to 8.6% between April and December 2022, while the core inflation rate stayed at around 6% except in April 2022.\\n\\n### Food Inflation\\n\\n* Food inflation based on Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) climbed to 7.0% in FY23 from 3.8% in FY22.\\n* The major contributors to food inflation are vegetables, cereals, milk, and spices.\\n\\n### Rural-Urban Inflation Differential\\n\\n* Rural inflation has remained above its urban counterpart throughout the current fiscal year, reversing the trend seen during the pandemic years.\\n\\n### Wholesale Price Inflation\\n\\n* WPI-based inflation remained low during the Covid-19 period and started to gain momentum in the post-pandemic period as economic activities resumed.\\n* The wholesale inflation rate climbed to about 13.0% in FY22.\\n\\n### Convergence of WPI and CPI Inflation\\n\\n* The headline inflation based on WPI and the CPI-C started diverging in March 2021, as WPI inflation touched double digits due to unfavourable base effects while CPI-C inflation remained stable.\\n* The gap began to narrow until April 2022. The path to convergence, however, was short-lived as another inflationary pressure started building up in February 2022.\\n\\n### Inflationary Expectations\\n\\n* Inflationary expectations are decisive in charting the course of inflation.\\n* The RBI's anchoring of inflationary expectations through forward guidance and responsive monetary policy has helped guide the trajectory of inflation in the country.\\n\\n### Housing Prices\\n\\n* Housing prices provide helpful information on the state of the economy via booms and busts in asset markets, which give rise to economic imbalances.\\n* Monitoring housing prices is essential for achieving the objectives of price stability, financial stability, and growth.\\n\\n### Pharmaceutical Prices\\n\\n* The principles for the regulation of the prices of drugs are based on the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Policy, 2012, administered by the Department of Pharmaceuticals.\\n* The key principles of the policy are the essentiality of drugs, control of formulation prices, and market-based pricing.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\n* It is not wishful thinking that 2023 will show less macroeconomic volatility than its preceding financial year.\\n* Both CPI-C and WPI have fallen below 6% (which is the RBI tolerance limit for the former) and are on the descending slope of the surge that hit the economy in the first half of the current fiscal.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## introduction\n\n- 5.1 Rising prices are always a cause of concern for policymakers as they hurt the common man the most. The perils of inflation are felt more in developing economies, where necessities have a higher share in the consumption basket than in developed countries. In recent years, India's inflation rate has been well-behaved, lying tamely below the RBI target rate of 4 per cent from 2017 to 2019.\n- 5.2 In 2020, supply-side disruptions pushed inflation beyond the RBI's upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent. The pandemic delivered a larger shock on supply than it did on demand, through supply-chain disruptions in the case of essential goods, food, medicine and industrial goods. In turn, this aggravated cost-push inflation in the country.\n- 5.3 As the pandemic receded, the conflict in Russia-Ukraine broke out, bringing in its wake worldwide inflation, fuelled mostly by surging prices of crude oil and other commodities. Prices soared to a decadal high and ate into household budgets, in turn prodding Central Banks to tighten monetary policy. A convalescing world economy was left to confront unprecedented rates of inflation. The spectre of stagflation loomed large on the horizon. In response, developed economies were left with no option but to raise interest rates. As the US Federal Reserve raised rates, the US dollar appreciated, making dollar-denominated fuel imports even dearer.\n- 5.4 In advanced economies, the rate of inflation is projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to increase from 3.1 per cent in 2021 to 7.2 per cent in 2022, the highest since 1982. The Euro area saw the rate reach 10.0 per cent in September 2022 (WEO, October 2022 1 ). The US inflation reached its 40-year high at 9.1 per cent in June 2022 before moderating to 6.5 per cent in December 2022, while the UK saw an annual price rise of 9.2 per cent in December 2022. Germany witnessed inflation  of  8.6  per  cent  in  December  2022. Among  emerging  markets, Brazil saw a moderation in price trends, while Turkey's inflation was above 80 per cent from August to November 2022 before declining slightly to 64.3 per cent in December 2022. The war had compounded the effects of a strong recovery in demand for goods and services after the pandemic. The inflation rate in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is  anticipated  to  have  increased  from  5.9  per  cent  in  2021  to  9.9  per  cent  in  2022  (WEO, October 2022).\n\n1  World Economic Outlook (WEO), IMF, October 2022\n\nFigure V.1: Record Consumer Price Inflation in 2022 Calendar Year\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: World Economic Outlook, October 2022, IMF\n\nNote: *The figure are annual averages; figures for 2022 and 2023 are projections.\n\nAdvanced Economies include 40 economies and EMDEs include 156 economies as per IMF classification\n\nFigure V.2: High Consumer Price Inflation in Advanced Economies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: OECD\n\n- 5.5 The groundwork for the commendable inflation management in India was laid earlier as fiscal and monetary measures adopted to stave off the pandemic-induced economic woes were prudent and well-calibrated. India chose not to overstimulate, and hence price pressures due to\n\nthe Russia-Ukraine conflict could be contained. Excessive heat in summer and uneven rainfall thereafter in some parts of the country affected the farm sector, reducing supply and causing prices of some major products to rise. India's inflation rate peaked in April 2022 at 7.8 per cent before moderating to 5.7 per cent in December 2022 on the back of good monsoons as well as prompt government measures that ensured adequate food supply. Global economic slowdown and interest rate increases brought down commodity prices, contributing to a substantial decline in wholesale price inflation. Thus, input price pressures on Indian manufacturers abated.\n\n- 5.6 Even as inflation abated at the wholesale level, there has been a pass-through of previously high input costs onto retail prices. Core inflation remains sticky at nearly 6 per cent and reflects the second-round effects of the supply shocks witnessed earlier this year. Further, with the recovery of demand, there has been a pickup in service inflation. Against this backdrop, we discuss trends and drivers  of  retail  and  wholesale  price  inflation  in  FY22  and  FY23,  state-wise  and  ruralurban differential in consumer inflation, fuel price inflation, CPI and WPI convergence, housing prices, pharmaceutical pricing and fiscal as well as monetary policy measures undertaken to contain inflation as the chapter proceeds.",
