See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Union Budget for FY23 was presented in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, with the government adopting a fiscal policy response to the crisis comprising increased food and fertilizer subsidies and reduced taxes on fuel and imported products. Despite additional fiscal pressures, the Union Government is on track to achieve the budget estimate for the fiscal deficit in FY23. The Gross Tax Revenue registered a YoY growth of 15.5% from April to November 2022, driven by robust growth in direct taxes and Goods and Services Tax (GST). The growth in direct taxes during the first eight months of the year was much higher than their corresponding longer-term averages. The GST has stabilized as a vital revenue source for central and state governments, with gross GST collections increasing at 24.8% on a YoY basis during April-December 2022.\\n\\nOn the expenditure side, the Union Government's emphasis on capital expenditure (Capex) has continued, with Capex steadily increasing from a long-term average of 1.7% of GDP (FY09 to FY20) to 2.5% of GDP in FY22 PA. The Centre has also incentivized State Governments through interest-free loans and enhanced borrowing ceilings to prioritize their spending on Capex. The increase in Capex has large-scale positive implications for medium-term growth. The government's fiscal policy response necessitated additional spending on food and fertilizer subsidies, accompanied by specific duty cuts to control the pass-through of high imported prices to consumers/users.\\n\\nThe fiscal deficit of the Union Government, which reached 9.2% of GDP during the pandemic year FY21, has moderated to 6.7% of GDP in FY22 PA and is further budgeted to reach 6.4% of GDP in FY23. The resilience in the fiscal performance of the Union Government has been facilitated by the recovery in economic activity, buoyancy in revenues from direct taxes and GST, and realistic assumptions in the Budget. The Gross Tax Revenue (GTR) to the Centre was envisaged to grow at 9.6% in FY23 BE relative to FY22 RE, but given the higher 'Provisional Actual' figures recorded for the GTR relative to the Revised estimates in FY22, the growth in GTR of FY23 BE turns out to be a mere 1.8% over FY22 PA.\\n\\nThe annual estimate of GTR for FY23 is expected to overshoot the budget estimates, with GTR growing at a much higher rate (15.5%) from April to November 2022. Direct taxes, which broadly constitute half of the Gross Tax Revenue, have registered a YoY growth of 26% from April to November 2022, enabled by corporate and personal income tax growth. Customs and excise duties have acted as flexible policy tools during the fiscal response to the pandemic, with the government raising excise duty on petrol and diesel to augment the revenue pool and subsequently reducing it to control inflationary pressures.\\n\\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) has evolved and stabilized as a vital revenue source for central and state governments, with gross GST collections growing at 24.8% on a YoY basis during April-December 2022. The improvement in GST collections is due to the combined effect of rapid economic recovery post-pandemic, nationwide drive against GST evaders and fake bills, and various rate rationalization measures undertaken by the GST Council. The number of GST taxpayers has doubled, increasing from nearly 70 lakh in 2017 to more than 1.4 crore in 2022.\\n\\nThe Union government's non-debt receipts comprise revenue receipts (tax and non-tax) and non-debt capital receipts. The shortfall in non-debt receipts to meet expenditure requirements is met by borrowings of the government (fiscal deficit). The government has reaffirmed its commitment towards privatization and strategic disinvestment of Public Sector Enterprises by implementing the New Public Sector Enterprise Policy and Asset Monetization Strategy. The government has provided 50-year interest-free loans to state governments under the 'Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment' for the last three years, with an allocation of â‚¹1.05 lakh crore for FY23.\\n\\nThe Centre's capital expenditure has steadily increased from a long-term average of 1.7% of GDP (FY09 to FY20) to 2.5% of GDP in FY22 PA, and is further budgeted to increase to 2.9% of GDP in FY23. The government's thrust on capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure-intensive sectors like roads and highways, railways, and housing and urban affairs, has longer-term implications for growth. The capital expenditure by the Centre registered a YoY growth of over 60% from April to November 2022, much higher than the long-term average growth of 13.5% recorded in the corresponding period from FY16 to FY20.\\n\\nThe revenue expenditure of the Union government was brought down from 15.6% of GDP in the pandemic year FY21 to 13.5% of GDP in FY22 PA. However, due to the sudden outbreak of geopolitical conflict, there was a higher food and fertilizer subsidy requirement, and the revenue expenditure from April to November 2022 has grown by over 10% on a YoY basis. Interest payments as a proportion of receipts went up after the pandemic outbreak, but are expected to come down in the medium term as the government moves along the fiscal glide path.\\n\\nThe General Government finances give an overview of the fiscal position of the Government sector as a whole. The General Government liabilities as a proportion of GDP increased steeply during FY21 on account of additional borrowings made by Centre and States on account of the pandemic. However, the ratio has come off its peak in FY22 (RE). The General Government deficits as a percent of GDP have also consolidated after their peak in FY21. The General Government is expected to follow the path of fiscal consolidation in the medium term.\\n\\nA positive growth-interest rate differential keeps the Government Debt sustainable, with India's public debt profile relatively stable and characterized by low currency and interest rate risks. The weighted average maturity of the outstanding stock of dated securities of the government has increased from 9.7 years in end-March 2010 to 11.71 years in end-March 2022, reducing rollover risk in the medium-term. The growth-interest rate differential has historically been positive for India, keeping debt levels sustainable.\\n\\nA counterfactual experiment shows that sustained growth of 10% per annum would have resulted in much lower Union Government deficit and debt ratios for India in the post-pandemic years, despite keeping the expenditure levels the same. There is a need for continued vigilance and adherence to the path of fiscal prudence, but an undue alarm is unwarranted. The Centre should continue incentivizing States for reforms and higher capital spending to ensure a stronger General government, and the capex-led growth strategy will ensure sustainable debt levels in the medium term.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## introduction\n\n- 3.1 With the continuing global risks and uncertainties, the availability of fiscal space with governments has become paramount. It is especially true following the recent incidence of the pandemic when the fiscal policy became an effective macroeconomic stabilisation tool globally. In India, particularly when all economic activities had reached a standstill, fiscal policy was instrumental  in  providing  a  safety  net  to  the  vulnerable,  reviving  the  economy  by  boosting demand, and addressing certain domestic supply-side constraints through public investments and sustained structural reforms.\n- 3.2 The large, frontloaded packages across the countries led to over-stimulation of demand, leading to its much faster recovery. In combination with the still-existing supply disruptions and constraints, the overheating of the economy led to inflationary pressures. The conflict in Europe and the related geopolitical developments aggravated the crisis. The slowing global growth, rising interest rates, persistently high inflation rates and uncertain global environment have thus posed certain pertinent questions for fiscal-policy experts to motivate the overarching fiscal policy strategy. How to evaluate the trade-off between maintaining fiscal support to manage the continuing crisis versus withdrawing fiscal stimulus from the economy to control inflation and regain the lost fiscal space? When to do so and at what pace? While a sudden withdrawal may have costs for medium-term growth, a slow withdrawal may be inflationary and hence put upward pressure on yields, making the debt costly. Moreover, the financial markets may have less tolerance for fiscal unorthodoxy in an era of rising interest rates 1 .\n- 3.3 Against this backdrop, the Government of India adopted a calibrated fiscal response to the pandemic and planned to withdraw the fiscal stimulus gradually as it moves along the glide path outlined in the Budget FY22. This chapter discusses the government's fiscal strategy amidst uncertain geopolitical developments. The chapter starts with a discussion of the performance of the Union Government's finances, followed by an overview of the State finances. It concludes with a commentary on India's debt profile.",
