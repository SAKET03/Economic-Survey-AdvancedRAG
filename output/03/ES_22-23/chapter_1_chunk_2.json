The economy is expected to grow at 6.5-7.0% in FY23, driven by private consumption and capital formation. However, downside risks to the growth outlook remain, including a widening current account deficit and global economic uncertainty. Policy recommendations include continued support for private sector investment, implementation of structural reforms, and targeted social security measures.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# The Global Economy Battles Through a Unique Set of Challenges\n\n## the global economy battles through a unique set of challenges\n\n- 1.1 In the last century, several events can be recollected that have had an adverse impact on the global economy. The two world wars are still vivid in public memory, along with the Spanish flu and the great depression. Regional conflicts have been several, as also intermittent oil shocks. The previous millennium closed with the East Asian crisis, and the new millennium in its first decade opened with the technology bust, followed several years later by the global financial crisis. The second decade, apart from minor episodes of the taper tantrum and growing trade tensions between the super-powers, had gone relatively incident-free globally, although Europe had its moments of stress during the decade. Before the third decade of the new millennium commenced,  incidents  of  global  economic  turbulence  were  generally  spaced  out,  allowing economies breathing time to recover before preparing for the next challenge.\n- 1.2 The Covid-19 pandemic ('pandemic' hereinafter) notified by the WHO in January 2020 was the first challenge of the third decade that hit global growth. Two years later, as the global economy was recovering from the pandemic-induced output contraction, the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out in February 2022, triggering a swing in commodity prices and, thus, accelerating existing inflationary pressures. This posed the second challenge. Soon after, the third challenge emerged when nations undertook monetary tightening to rein in inflation causing growth to weaken. Monetary tightening also drove capital flows to safe-haven US markets, contributed to rising sovereign bond yields, and depreciation of most currencies against the US dollar. The consequent increase in borrowing costs also stressed high levels of public and private debt, threatening the financial system. Faced with the prospects of global stagflation, nations, feeling compelled to protect their respective economic space, slowed cross-border trade, which posed the fourth challenge to growth.  All along, the fifth challenge was festering as China experienced a considerable slowdown induced by its policies. The sixth medium-term challenge to growth was seen in the scarring from the pandemic brought in by the loss of education and incomeearning opportunities. A simultaneous occurrence of several challenges to growth is perhaps unprecedented.  Like the rest of the world, India, too, faced this extraordinary set of challenges but withstood them better than most economies.\n- 1.3 Global economic recovery was well on track until the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out in February 2022. The conflict has now continued for almost a year, disrupting the restoration of the supply chains disrupted earlier by lockdowns and limited trade traffic. In the last eleven months, the world economy has faced almost as many disruptions as caused by the pandemic\n\nin two years. The conflict caused the prices of critical commodities such as crude oil, natural gas, fertilisers, and wheat to soar. This strengthened the inflationary pressures that the global economic recovery had triggered, backed by massive fiscal stimuli and ultra-accommodative monetary policies undertaken to limit the output contraction in 2020. Inflation in Advanced Economies (AEs), which accounted for most of the global fiscal expansion and monetary easing, breached historical highs. Rising commodity prices also led to higher inflation in the Emerging Market Economies (EMEs), which otherwise were in the lower inflation zone by virtue of their governments undertaking a calibrated fiscal stimulus to address output contraction in 2020.\n\nfigure I.1: Sharp rise in commodity prices due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict; prices yet to reach pre-conflict levels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: IMF\n\nInflation stays high, driven by high food and energy prices\n\nfigure I.2a: advanced economies\n\nfigure I.2b: emerging market economies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.4 Central banks, which were slow to react to price pressures building up during the nascent recovery from the pandemic, regarded them as transient only to realise, belatedly, the necessity and the inevitability of a strong monetary policy response. Led by the US Federal Reserve, central banks have been hiking policy rates and rolling back liquidity to rein in inflation synchronously. The pace of this tightening cycle has been rapid - the Federal Reserve's pace of rate hikes is the quickest since the inflationary episode of the 1970s, with the central bank having raised interest rates by 425 basis points since March 2022.  As the impact of monetary policy actions is felt with a lag, inflation rates remained stubbornly high during the early phase of the rate hike cycle but have begun to decline lately. At the same time, synchronised rate hikes by the central banks have not tightened financial conditions sufficiently enough for central banks to end their tightening campaign.\n\nfinancial conditions tighten\n\nfigure I.3a: advanced economies\n\nfigure I.3b: emerging market economies\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg\n\nNote: All Y-axes are indices; Data is retrieved from Goldman Sachs financial condition index\n\n1.5 Inflation and monetary tightening led to a hardening of bond yields across economies and resulted in an outflow of equity capital from most of the economies around the world into the traditionally safe-haven market of the US. Unlike the past when the capital flight was more out of the EMEs given their relatively greater vulnerabilities, or the perception thereof, this time around, capital has also flown out from the advanced economies. The capital flight subsequently led to the strengthening of the US Dollar against other currencies - the US Dollar index strengthened by 16.1 per cent between January and September 2022. The consequent depreciation of other currencies has been widening the CAD and increasing inflationary pressures in the net importing economies.\n\nhardening of bond yields across economies\n\nfigure I.4a: 10-year Bond yield in aes\n\nfigure I.4b: 10-year Bond yield in emes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\nfigure I.5: the federal funds Rate was raised by a cumulative 425 basis points since Jan 2022 leading to capital flight from emes and aes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Federal Reserve\n\nSource: Bloomberg\n\n1.6 Rising inflation and monetary tightening led to a slowdown in global output beginning in the second half of 2022. The global PMI composite index has been in the contractionary zone since August 2022, while the yearly growth rates of global trade, retail sales, and industrial production have significantly declined in the second half of 2022. The consequent dampening of  the  global  economic  outlook,  also  compounded  by  expectations  of  a  further  increase  in borrowing costs, was reflected in the lowering of growth forecasts by the IMF in its October 2022 update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO).\n\ntable I.1: Global economic challenges led to a downward revision in growth forecast across countries\n\n|                           |   Growth projections (per cent) |   Growth projections (per cent) |   change from WeoUpdate (July 2022) (per cent) |   change from WeoUpdate (July 2022) (per cent) |\n|---------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n|                           |                          2022   |                          2023   |                                         2022   |                                         2023   |\n| World                     |                             3.2 |                             2.7 |                                            0   |                                           -0.2 |\n| advanced economies        |                             2.4 |                             1.1 |                                           -0.1 |                                           -0.3 |\n| United States             |                             1.6 |                             1   |                                           -0.7 |                                            0   |\n| euro area                 |                             3.1 |                             0.5 |                                            0.5 |                                           -0.7 |\n| UK                        |                             3.6 |                             0.3 |                                            0.4 |                                           -0.2 |\n| Japan                     |                             1.7 |                             1.6 |                                            0   |                                           -0.1 |\n| emerging market economies |                             3.7 |                             3.7 |                                            0.1 |                                           -0.2 |\n| china                     |                             3.2 |                             4.4 |                                           -0.1 |                                           -0.2 |\n| India*                    |                             6.8 |                             6.1 |                                           -0.6 |                                            0   |\n\nSource: IMF\n\nNote: *Projection for India is for its fiscal year (Apr-Mar), while for the other economies, it is from Jan-Dec.\n\n## figure I.6: Global composite pmI in the contractionary zone since august 2022\n\nfigure I.7: yoy growth in retail sales, industrial production and trade falling\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: IHS Markit\n\nSource: OECD, November 2022\n\n1.7 Compounding the  bleak  global  growth  outlook  have  been  the  slowdown  in  economic activity in China caused by the government's zero Covid policy, a contracting real estate sector, and a tepid fiscal expansion. However, China has ended or relaxed most of its restrictive policies relating to Covid. It is possible that economic activity picks up in China sooner than expected. But it is too soon to tell.\n\nfigure I.8a: china's Industrial production Growth (yoy) declining\n\nfigure I.8b: china's Retail Sales Growth (yoy) moderating\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Bloomberg, National Bureau of Statistics of China\n\n1.8 Further tightening of monetary policy may aggravate fragilities built up in the financial system over the years, such as private and government debt structures, the effects of which could trigger financial contagion. Non-financial sector debt of most economies has increased considerably as a percentage of GDP since Q1 of 2008 when the global financial crisis struck. India is, however, one of the few countries whose debt burden has declined over this period, mainly  because  of  the  country's  banking  sector  balance  sheet  clean-up  and  the  corporate sector's deleveraging exercise undertaken during the last decade. Yet, an increase in the general government  debt  burden  in  India  has  attracted  much  attention,  even  as  systemic  risks  of  a financial breakdown are concentrated in other parts of the world.\n\n| table I.2: core Debt of most major economies except India is higher as compared to 2008   | table I.2: core Debt of most major economies except India is higher as compared to 2008   |

non-financial sector')\n\n1.9 In the developed world, inflationary pressures are abating but they are still on the higher side historically and relative to the inflation targets that many countries have adopted. Major central banks have reduced the pace of interest rate hikes in their latest rounds of monetary policy reviews to assess the impact thus far. Still, they have reiterated that terminal policy rates will be significantly higher than market expectations. Strong employment data and sharply lower headline inflation for December have raised hopes of the US economy achieving a softer landing. Similarly, in Europe, warmer winter weather has neutralised the risk of a near-term energy crisis. Lately, however, banks have reported much weaker earnings growth, and technology companies have begun to announce layoffs in America. Therefore, on balance, downside risk to the global economic outlook dominates.",
