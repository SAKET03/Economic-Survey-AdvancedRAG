  "content": "Chapter 8 Summary:\nThe agriculture and allied sector has been performing well, with an average annual growth rate of 4.6% over the last six years. In 2021-22, the sector grew by 3.0% compared to 3.3% in 2020-21. India has emerged as a net exporter of agricultural products, with exports reaching an all-time high of $50.2 billion in 2021-22. The government has taken measures to promote farmer-producer organizations, encourage crop diversification, and improve productivity in agriculture through support for mechanization and the creation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme has provided income support to farmers, leading to diversification in sources of farmers' income and improving their resilience to weather shocks. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) has been implemented to provide food security, with 81.4 crore beneficiaries receiving free foodgrains for one year from January 1, 2023. The government has also taken initiatives to enhance credit availability, facilitate mechanization, and boost horticulture and organic farming. The animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries sectors have been recognized as emerging sectors, with the government providing support for their development. The chapter discusses various policy initiatives, including the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure returns over the cost of production, and the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) to provide short-term credit to farmers at subsidized interest rates. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) has been introduced to provide hassle-free credit availability to farmers, with 3.89 crore KCCs issued as of December 30, 2022. The government has also promoted organic farming, with 44.3 lakh organic farmers and 59.1 lakh hectares of area brought under organic farming by 2021-22. The chapter highlights the importance of the agriculture sector in India's growth and development, with a focus on sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## Introduction\n\n- 8.1 With its solid forward linkages, the agriculture and allied activities sector significantly contributed to the country's overall growth and development by ensuring food security. The Indian agriculture sector has been growing at an average annual growth rate of 4.6 per cent during the last six years.  It grew by 3.0 per cent in 2021-22 compared to 3.3 per cent in 202021. In recent years, India has also rapidly emerged as the net exporter of agricultural products. In  2020-21, exports of agriculture and allied products from India grew by 18 per cent over the previous year.  During 2021-22, agricultural exports reached an all-time high of US$ 50.2 billion.  This period of buoyant performance could be ascribed to the measures taken by the Government  to  promote  farmer-producer  organisations,  encourage  crop  diversification,  and improve productivity in agriculture through support provided for mechanisation and the creation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. Thus, enabling the country, in the spirit of Vasudhaiva\n\nKutumbakam, to provide necessary and essential support to other countries for the losses faced during Covid-19. Further, income support to farmers through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the promotion of allied activities has led to diversification in sources of farmers' income, improving their resilience to weather shocks.\n\nFigure VIII.1: despite covid-19 shock agriculture and allied sector shows resilient growth\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: MoSPI's Annual and Quarterly Estimates of GDP at constant prices, 2011-12 series.\n\n8.2 The interventions of the Government have been in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Doubling Farmers' Income, which had identified improvement in crop and livestock productivity,  diversification  towards  higher  value  crops,  better  resource  efficiency,  enhanced cropping intensity, improvement in real prices received by farmers and shift from farm to nonfarm occupations as being significant sources of growth. Several policy measures, such as the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to secure the price at one and half times the all-India weighted average cost of production, schemes and price measures to focus on high-value added crops such as  oilseed,  incentives  for  crop  diversification  through  price  policy  measures,  improvements  in agricultural marketing and by enhancing resource use efficiency etc. have been adopted. While Indian agriculture has performed well, the sector needs re-orientation in the backdrop of certain challenges like adverse impacts of climate change, fragmented landholdings, sub-optimal farm mechanisation, low productivity, disguised unemployment, rising input costs, etc.\n\nVarious policy initiatives introduced and implemented to deal with these issues are discussed later in this chapter.\n\nFigure VIII.2: crowding in of Private investment in agriculture\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Agricultural Statistics at a Glance 2021.\n\nFigure VIII.3: India's electricity consumption in Agriculture (Annual)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation",
