The  challenges posed by the aftermath of the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021 and the ensuing Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2022 have impacted the development trajectory of India and the world. In the wake of these developments, there was a global decline in human development. According to United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) report, 90 per cent of countries have registered a reduction in their Human Development Index (HDI) 6 value in 2020 or 2021, indicating that human development across the world has stalled for the first time in 32 years. India  ranked  132  out  of  191  countries  and  territories  in  the  2021/2022  HDI  report 7 .  India's HDI value of 0.633 in 2021 places the country in the medium human development category, lower than its value of 0.645 in 2019. However, India's HDI value continues to exceed South Asia's 8   average human development. It has been steadily increasing and moving towards the world average since 1990 due to priority placed on investment in social infrastructure, including ensuring universal health and education.\n\n- 6.9 On the parameter of gender inequality, India's Gender Inequality Index (GII) 9  value is 0.490 in 2021 and is ranked 122. This score is better than that of the South Asian region (value: 0.508)  and  close  to  the  world  average  of  0.465.  This  reflects  the  Government's  initiatives and  investments  towards  more  inclusive  growth,  social  protection,  and  gender-responsive development  policies.  The  country's  progress  in  dealing  with  multidimensional  poverty  is presented in Box VI.1.\n\ntable Vi.2: india's position and trends in the global Hdi 2021\n\n|                    | Hdi 2021   | Hdi 2021   | Hdi rank 2020   | life expectancy at birth   | expected years of schooling   | mean years of schooling   | gross national income per capita   |\n|--------------------|------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------|\n|                    | rank       | Value      |                 | (years)                    | (years)                       | (years)                   | (2017 ppp$)                        |\n| Switzerland        | 1          | 0.962      | 3               | 84.0                       | 16.5                          | 13.9                      | 66,933                             |\n| Norway             | 2          | 0.961      | 1               | 83.2                       | 18.2                          | 13.0                      | 64,660                             |\n| United Kingdom     | 18         | 0.929      | 17              | 80.7                       | 17.3                          | 13.4                      | 45,225                             |\n| Japan              | 19         | 0.925      | 19              | 84.8                       | 15.2                          | 13.4                      | 42,274                             |\n| United States      | 21         | 0.921      | 21              | 77.2                       | 16.3                          | 13.7                      | 64,765                             |\n| China              | 79         | 0.768      | 82              | 78.2                       | 14.2                          | 7.6                       | 17,504                             |\n| Brazil             | 87         | 0.754      | 86              | 72.8                       | 15.6                          | 8.1                       | 14,370                             |\n| South Africa       | 109        | 0.713      | 102             | 62.3                       | 13.6                          | 11.4                      | 12,948                             |\n| Indonesia          | 114        | 0.705      | 116             | 67.6                       | 13.7                          | 8.6                       | 11,466                             |\n| india              | 132        | 0.633      | 130             | 67.2                       | 11.9                          | 6.7                       | 6,590                              |\n| South asian region |            | 0.632      |                 | 67.9                       | 11.6                          | 6.7                       | 6,481                              |\n| World average      |            | 0.732      |                 | 71.4                       | 12.8                          | 8.6                       | 16,752                             |\n\nSource: 2021/2022 Human Development Report, UNDP\n\n6 The Human Development Report published by the UNDP estimates the HDI in terms of three basic parameters: to live a long and healthy life; to be educated and knowledgeable and to enjoy a decent economic standard of living. It is calculated using 4 indicators - life expectancy at birth, mean years of schooling, expected years of schooling, and the GNI per capita.\n\n- 7  Released on 8 September 2022 and provides ranking for the year 2021.\n- 8  South Asia includes Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Islamic Republic of Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka\n\n9  The index measures inequality in achievement between women and men in three dimensions, viz. reproductive health, empowerment, and the labour market. It shows the loss in potential human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in these dimensions. The value of GIII ranges from 0, where women and men fare equally, to 1, where one gender fares as poorly as possible in all measured dimensions.\n\n## box Vi.1: undp multidimensional poverty index 2022\n\nGenerally, poverty is primarily measured in terms of lack of monetary means for a decent living. However, by definition 'poverty' has wider implications and leads to multiple disadvantages at the same time - such as poor health or malnutrition, lack of sanitation, clean drinking water or electricity, poor quality of education etc. Focusing on one factor alone, such as income, is not enough to capture the reality of poverty.\n\nMultidimensional poverty measures are hence used to create a more comprehensive picture. It reveals who is poor and how they are poor and the range of different deprivations experienced by them.\n\nOne such measure is the United Nations Development Programme's (UNDP) global Multidimensional Poverty  Index  (MPI)  which  measures  acute  multidimensional  poverty  across  more  than  100 developing countries. The methodology involves measuring each person's overlapping deprivations across 10 indicators in three equally weighted dimensions: health, education, and standard of living. The health and education dimensions are based on two indicators each, while the standard of living is based on six indicators. All the indicators needed to construct the MPI for a country are taken from the same household survey. Each indicator is equally weighted within its dimension, so the health and education indicators are weighted 1/6 each, and the standard of living indicators are weighted 1/18 each. The MPI ranges from 0 to 1, and higher values imply higher multidimensional poverty. The MPI complements the international US$ 1.90-a-day poverty line by identifying who is multidimensionally poor and shows the composition of multidimensional poverty.\n\n## mpi for india\n\nThe 2022 report of the UNDP on MPI was released in October 2022 and covers 111 developing countries. As regards India, the survey data for 2019-21 has been used. Based on these estimates, 16.4 per cent of the population in India (228.9 million people in 2020) is multidimensionally poor while an  additional  18.7per  cent  is  classified  as  vulnerable  to  multidimensional  poverty  (260.9  million people in 2020). The intensity of deprivation in India, which is the average deprivation score among people living in multidimensional poverty, is 42 per cent. The MPI value, which is the share of the population that is multidimensionally poor adjusted by the intensity of the deprivations, is 0.069.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: UNDP Report on Multidimensional Poverty, 2022\n\nThe report also compares multidimensional poverty with monetary poverty measured by the percentage of the population living below the 2011 PPP of US$1.90 per day. It shows that monetary poverty does not present the complete picture. The headcount or incidence of multidimensional poverty is 6.1 percentage points lower than the incidence of monetary poverty. This implies that individuals living below the monetary poverty line may have access to non-income resources.\n\nThe findings of the report suggest that in India, 41.5 crore people exited poverty between 2005-06 and 2019-21, demonstrating that the SDG target 1.2 of reducing at least by half the proportion of men, women, and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions by 2030 is possible to achieve.\n\nThe poorest states and groups (children, lower castes and those living in rural areas) reduced poverty the fastest in absolute terms, although the data do not reflect post-Covid-19 pandemic changes.\n\nAmong the multidimensionally poor, deprivation prevalence declined across deprivation categories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCting an example of how things are changing at the ground level, Dr. Sundipto Mundle, Chairman, Centre for Development Studies, in a newspaper article 'Villages at the periphery and the changing face of backwardness', Live Mint, 24 November 2022, informs about his visit to four backward villages  in  Jharkhand,  and  reports  about  considerable  progress  in  physical  infrastructure  such  as roads, houses, digital connectivity, adequate irrigation facilities, Public Distribution System (PDS), education  facilities  etc.  With  the  intervention  of  the  State  and  the  general  market  development, extreme deprivation and hunger have been eliminated in these villages. 10",
