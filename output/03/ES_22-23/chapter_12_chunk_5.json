See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"India's infrastructure development has been on a consistent growth curve since Independence, with significant investments in transportation, housing, commercial development, telecom, and sanitation. The government has used 'social overhead capital' to push development in remote areas through dedicated budgetary allocation, cross-subsidizing revenue-generating infrastructure, and focused program delivery. This has helped expand physical transportation and connectivity, provide services at point-of-use, and deepen digital penetration.\\n\\nIn 2019, the Government of India adopted a forward-looking programmatic approach towards infrastructure, launching the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) with a projected investment of around ₹111 lakh crore for FY20-25. The NIP aims to develop a comprehensive view of infrastructure development, monitor progress, and enable a pipeline view for investors. The funding for infrastructure comes from various sources, including government, private sector, and multilateral organizations.\\n\\nThe government has also launched the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) with an estimated aggregate monetisation potential of ₹6.0 lakh crore through core assets of the Central Government over a four-year period. The NMP aims to tap private sector investment for new infrastructure creation and provide an opportunity for deleveraging balance sheets and providing fiscal space for investment in new infrastructure assets.\\n\\nThe programmatic approach to infrastructure is complemented by structural and financial reforms, such as infrastructure financing options, creation of Dedicated Financing Institution (NaBFID), recapitalisation of other sectoral DFIs, and push to PPP ecosystem through Model Concession Agreements. The government has also launched the PM GatiShakti National Master Plan, which entails creation of a common umbrella platform with all infrastructure projects incorporated within a comprehensive database for efficient planning and implementation.\\n\\nIndia has made significant progress in digital infrastructure, with the country witnessing a meteoric rise in digital adoption, including a increase in tele-density to 93%, digital payment transactions to 600 crore per month, and bank accounts to over 80%. The government has launched several initiatives, including the Digital India programme, to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy.\\n\\nThe Unified Payments Interface (UPI) has been a game-changer in real-time payments, with 782 crore transactions worth ₹12.8 lakh crore in December 2022. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) aims to create an open protocol for digital commerce, increasing freedom of choice for consumers and enabling small businesses to exercise more freedom in business decision-making.\\n\\nThe government has also emphasized the importance of radio as a medium of mass communication, with All India Radio broadcasting in 23 languages and 179 dialects from 479 stations across the country. The government has launched several initiatives to improve logistics, including the National Logistics Policy (NLP), which aims to reduce the cost of logistics in India to be comparable to global benchmarks by 2030.\\n\\nIndia's infrastructure journey has been global in outlook but domestic in innovation and implementation, with the country facing unique challenges. The government has set a vision to place India among the top three global economies and inch closer to the status of a developed nation by the 100th year of its Independence. The chapter covers the government's plans to achieve this vision, including increasing infrastructure investment, leveraging digital technologies, and improving coordination and efficiency in infrastructure projects.\\n\\nThe government has increased capital expenditure, with a sharp increase in 2022-23, and has set up a National Bank for Financing Infrastructure and Development (NaBFID) to support infrastructure development. The government has also launched several initiatives to promote public-private partnerships, including the Public Private Partnership Appraisal Committee (PPPAC) and the Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme.\\n\\nThe National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) and the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) are key initiatives to support infrastructure development, with a focus on transportation, energy, and social infrastructure. The government has also launched several initiatives to improve the logistics sector, including the National Logistics Policy (NLP) and the Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS) index.\\n\\nThe digital infrastructure sector has seen significant growth, with a focus on digital payments, e-governance, and digital commerce. The government has launched several initiatives to promote digital infrastructure, including the Digital India programme, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). The government has also emphasized the importance of data governance and cybersecurity, with a focus on protecting user data and promoting a safe and secure digital environment.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Developments in Digital Infrastructure\n\n## developments in digital infrastructure\n\n12.58 While the role of traditional infrastructure has been well recognised, in recent years, the role of digital infrastructure in socio-economic development of the country has assumed an  increased  importance.  This  was  especially  true  during  the  Covid-19  period  when  the curtailment of physical interactions necessitated the utilisation of digital infrastructure already available for service delivery and remote work. In the coming years, the availability and spread of  digital  infrastructure  will  contribute  significantly  to  economic  growth.  Recognising  this, the  government's  Digital  India  programme,  which  aims  to  transform  India  into  a  digitally empowered society and knowledge economy, envisions digital infrastructure as a core utility to every citizen. The focus areas include the availability of high-speed internet as a core utility for delivery of services to citizens, unique digital identity, enabling citizen participation in digital and financial space, shareable private space on a public cloud (citizens can digitally store their documents, certificates, etc. and share them with public agencies or others without the need to physically submit them), and a safe and secure cyber-space. Some developments in the digital infrastructure sphere are detailed below.\n\n## Telecommunications: Accelerating provision of affordable services\n\n12.59 As  a  result  of  the  persistent  efforts  made  by  the  government  towards  promoting technological development, telecommunications services have penetrated the remotest corners of the nation. The country has come a long way from the days when a telephone connection was seen  as  a  luxury  to  the  present  where  a  majority  of  people  have  a  mobile  connection. This was due to a cumulative effort of telecom players who widened their network bandwidth, government's enabling environment and consumers' outreach for smartphones. Today, the total telephone subscriber base in India stands at 117 crore (as of November 2022). While more than 97 per cent of the total subscribers are connected wirelessly (114.3 crore at the end of November 2022), 83.7 crore have internet connections as of June 2022. The overall tele-density in India stood  at  84.8  per  cent,  with  wide  differences  across  states.  It  ranged  from  55.4  per  cent  in Bihar to 270.6 per cent in Delhi. Eight license service areas, namely, Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata,\n\nHimachal Pradesh, Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka had a tele-density of above 100 per cent.\n\nfigure Xii.10: overall tele density, license service area wise\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Department of Telecommunications\n\n12.60 Apart from the interstate disparity in tele-density, in rural areas the tele-density continues to be at much lower levels compared to urban areas. However, the catch-up by the rural areas is heartening as the YoY change in internet subscribers is greater in rural (for the majority of the states) than in urban areas. This provided a cushion to the rural economy during the initial phase of the Covid-19 as many people went back to rural India for their livelihood. The digital infrastructure created over the years ensured not just the continuous transmission of information but also added economic value when businesses went digital.\n\n## Box Xii.4: lessening the rural-urban digital divide\n\nConverting the crisis into opportunity, India, through its resilient measures, has been able to contain the impact of the pandemic through structural reforms in several sectors, telecom being one of them. During the challenging times of Covid-19 pandemic, the telecommunication sector continued to provide seamless connectivity for the smooth functioning of critical activities and services such as 'work from home', 'study from home' etc. This was supported by the significant increase in affordable smartphones, which became more than a communication device. It emerged as the key enabler of Digital India initiative with various new services and applications like digital payments, e-governance, e-commerce, e-health, and e-education. Acting  as  the  backbone,  these  services  have  boosted  the  overall  economic  growth  of  the country.\n\nBefore 2014, access to digital services was perceived as a prerogative of urban households.\n\nThis was substantiated by the then-existing digital divide seen from tele density (number of subscribers per 100 inhabitants) in rural and urban areas being 44.01 and 145.46 respectively in  2014. However, with the vision of developing digital infrastructure as a core utility for every citizen, Digital India as an umbrella programme was launched in 2015. Service delivery through  digital  tools  has  travelled  a  long  way  since  then.  We  have  added  more  internet subscribers in rural areas in the last 3 years (2019-21) than in their urban counterparts (95.76 million vis-a-vis 92.81 million in rural and urban areas respectively). This has been a result of  dedicated  digital  drives  across  rural  areas  through  ambitious  government  schemes,  like the  flagship  BharatNet  Project  Scheme, Telecom Development Plan,  Aspirational District Scheme, initiatives in North-Eastern Region through Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan (CTDP) and initiatives towards areas affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE)etc.\n\nfigure: lsa wise difference in rural growth (per cent) over urban growth (per cent) in internet subscribers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThis concrete focus on bridging the gap between rural and urban internet penetration has borne positive results. The plot of the difference in the growth rates (per cent) of internet subscribers in rural over urban areas is somewhat volatile across states and years. The steep transition from a negative gap in 2018 for most LSAs to above 50 per cent in positive territory (for a majority of LSAs) in 2019 reflects the demand side growth in digital services, which was backed by the availability of budget smartphones and affordable data usage. The difference has been positive since then. 12\n\nThis significant growth in rural India was the major shock absorber during the COVID-19 pandemic when both businesses and consumer demand were impacted. When majority of the workforce reverse-migrated to rural areas in search of livelihoods, agriculture (3.4 per cent growth in FY20-21) as well as the world's largest employment scheme MNREGA supported the domestic economy. The digital infrastructure created over the years in rural areas ensured transparent and timely payments to the beneficiaries directly into their account thus limiting their exposure to the virus. With affordability and accessibility to private education restricted,\n\n12 per cent change in Rural subscriptions -  per cent change in Urban subscriptions.\n\nthe digital support system in government schools absorbed the then much-needed enrolment to counter the learning gap. As schooling went online for a considerable period even postpandemic, the increase in internet subscriptions in rural areas helped mitigate learning loss significantly. This even facilitated the successful rollout of mass vaccination in rural areas.\n\nThe 200 per cent increase in rural internet subscriptions between 2015 and 2021 vis-a-vis 158  per  cent  in  urban  areas,  reflects  the  increased  impetus  the  government  is  putting  to bring rural and urban digital connectivity to the same level. For further widening the net, to include unconnected areas and populations, dedicated long-term efforts by the government have been taken. Government Schemes like Production Linked Incentive (PLI) for telecom and networking products will promote domestic mobile manufacturing as well as network installation. Continuous proliferation of measures such as Bharat Net Project shall continue to improve accessibility, affordability, connectivity, and inclusivity pan-India. This in turn will help in realizing the vision of our Hon'ble Prime Minister to digitally empower every Indian, as we march towards India's 'Techade'.\n\n12.61 To  further  create  digital  linkages  at  the  grassroots  level  and  increase  the  consumer experience like the one in urban centres, a project for the saturation of 4G mobile services in uncovered villages across the country has been approved. The project will provide 4G mobile services in 24,680 uncovered villages in remote and difficult areas, and 6,279 villages having only 2G/3G connectivity shall be upgraded to 4G.\n\n12.62 With  a  special  focus  on  the  states  in  the  North-Eastern  Region,  the  government  is implementing a Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan (CTDP). Under CTDP for NER, mobile connectivity on 2G is to be provided by setting up 2004 towers in the uncovered villages and along National Highways of Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tripura, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh (National Highways only). As of 25 October 2021, 1,358 towers have been installed and they are operational. In addition, other projects on providing 4G mobile coverage to  uncovered  villages  in  Meghalaya, Arunachal  Pradesh  and  two  districts  of Assam  (Karbi Anglong &amp; Dima Hasao) are under way. Furthermore, to make available high-quality and highspeed internet access to the states of the North-Eastern Region of the country, Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) signed an Agreement with Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) on 18 August 2021 for the hiring of 10 Gigabits per second (Gbps) International Bandwidth for  Internet  Connectivity  to Agartala  from  Bangladesh  Submarine  Cable  Company  Limited (BSCCL), Bangladesh. The first 10 Gbps link was commissioned on 26 November 2021, and the second 10 Gbps link on 21 April 2022.\n\n12.63 When  telecom  is  spanning  coastlines,  forests,  and  even  deserts  why  should  islands be  left  behind? A  comprehensive  initiative  to  connect  our  islands  to  the  mainland  has  been realised through the government's initiative of the Comprehensive Telecom Development Plan for Islands. The Submarine OFC connectivity from Chennai to Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands (CANI) project was launched to connect Port Blair and seven other islands of Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands with Chennai through 2,313 km of underwater OFC. There has been an immense\n\nproliferation of bandwidth utilisation, almost 30 times, from 2.7Gbps to 75.7Gbps. The project has led to an FTTH speed of 100 Mbps, and up to 15 times more data volume is available now. The Submarine OFC connectivity from Kochi to Lakshadweep Islands (KLI) project was launched to connect Kochi with Kavaratti and ten other islands of Lakshadweep through 1869 kms of underwater OFC project, and the project is likely to be completed by May 2023. The project is currently under way and will ensure digital inclusion across the islands and is expected to trigger significant transformation across all sectors, including agriculture, tourism, health, and education.\n\n- 12.64 A landmark achievement in telecommunications in India was the launch of 5G services. 5G could impact consumers directly through higher data transfer speeds and lower latency. 5G use cases developed by Telecom Service Providers and start-ups in education, health, worker safety, smart agriculture etc., are now being deployed across the country. Telecom reforms and clear policy direction led to the spectrum auction of 2022 garnering the highest-ever bids.\n- 12.65 As a major reform measure, the Indian Telegraph Right of Way (Amendment) Rules, 2022, will facilitate faster and easier deployment of telegraph infrastructure to enable speedy 5G  rollout.  The  government  has  brought  in  procedural  reforms  in  Wireless  Licensing, including delicensing of various frequency bands to promote innovation, manufacturing and export.  The  National  Frequency Allocation  Plan  2022  (NFAP)  provides  a  broad  regulatory framework, identifying which frequency bands are available for cellular mobile services, Wi-fi, sound and television broadcasting, radio navigation for aircraft and ships, and other wireless communications. NFAP will give guidance to the users of the spectrum to plan their networks in accordance with the relevant frequency and parameters provided therein. Given that spectrum is a scarce resource, NFAP is useful in aligning spectrum usage with demands from emerging technologies in an efficient manner.\n- 12.66 To propel growth and to accelerate the provisioning of affordable services to the citizens in the fast-emerging area of satellite-based services, reforms have been undertaken to promote ease of doing business by limiting the multiplicity of charges at different stages of rolling out satellite-based communication services. To simplify the existing processes, vital changes have also been carried out to streamline satellite-related clearance processes.\n- 12.67 Universal and equitable access to broadband services across the country, especially in rural areas, is an important part of the government's vision for national digital connectivity. Toward realising that vision, the GatiShakti Sanchar portal was launched on 14 May 2022. This portal will streamline the process of Right of Way (RoW) applications and permissions across the country. The portal has been developed keeping in view the vision areas of the National Broadband Mission at the core, which are providing broadband infrastructure as a core utility to every citizen, governance and services on demand and in particular, digital empowerment of the citizens of our country.\n- 12.68 Now, having discussed telecom at length, the next digital story which rings in our ears is radio which has been one of the best media to reach all residents of the country.\n\n## Box Xii.5: radio - the waves that connected ..!!\n\nIn today's fast-moving social media age, it is noteworthy how one of the components of mass media, namely the radio has not only persisted as the bulwark for outreach during the times of pandemic and beyond but in this fast-evolving digital era has also embossed a separate identity of its own in the hearts of many. Radio continues to be the most affordable and popular medium of mass communication in India and has been a tool that has consistently helped in empowerment and social development of the people of our country. The accessibility, wide coverage, variety of programmes, mobility and vernacularity have continued to be reasons for its popularity. For instance, the popular 'Mann ki Baat' programme where the Prime Minister establishes a dialogue with the citizens on issues of day-to-day governance reached the milestone of completing its 96th episode on 25th December 2022, with more to follow this year.\n\nThe iconic line 'This is All India Radio. The news read by...' rings in our ears as we reminisce how Prasar Bharati, India's autonomous public service broadcaster, has not only been witness to the history and landmark events of the country, but has also been the proverbial story-teller for all citizens across the country, standing by its motto 'Bahujan Hitaya: Bahujan Sukhaya', meaning 'for the happiness of many, for the welfare of many'. It broadcasts in 23 languages, 179 dialects from 479 stations across the country, reaching nearly 92 per cent of the area and 99.2 per cent of the total population of the country. Prasar Bharati marked its silver jubilee on 23 November 2022, and it is notable how it has embraced technology, reflected in the fact that over 240 radio services of All India Radio are livestreamed on NewsOnAir App, Prasar Bharati's official App. These streams have a large number of listeners not just in India, but globally, in more than 85 countries across the world.\n\nAlong  with  the  public  broadcaster,  private  commercial  radio  stations  (FM  Radio)  and Community Radio Stations (CRS) each serve as platforms for a variety of programmes. FM Radio has flourished in the last few years, as observed in the quarterly growth in private FM Radio stations, with their number increasing from 243 in the quarter ending December 2015 to 388 in quarter ending June 2022 13 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe rising number of FM radio stations depicts how radio as mass media has satisfactorily delivered on their mandate of public service and stood strong with the people during the time of the pandemic. While FM increased its outreach to even far-flung rural areas, CRS targeted local and well-defined communities. The daunting task of spreading awareness on the pandemic, and that too in vernacular, with innumerable dialects, was made possible, as CRS channelized the community partnerships. In times when the reach of centralized media to every nook and corner of the country was a gargantuan task, these radio waves travelled without interruption for the larger public cause. They not only became a medium for information dissemination but also functioned as a channel for empowerment as virtual education also took the recourse of radio.\n\nWith this, we see the radio as being significantly important through good and tough times. As we operate in a new normal and as things settle down with time, these small boxes requiring manual tuning may again find their place in some household cupboards. However, their identity will remain intact. It will once again come to the fore to speak for itself with the iconic line 'This is All India Radio. The news read by...'.\n\n## growth story of digital Public infrastructure\n\n12.69 The  emergence  of  Digital  Public  Infrastructure  (DPI),  aimed  at  improving  financial literacy, innovation, entrepreneurship, employment generation, and empowering beneficiaries has played a critical role in uplifting the economy and bringing it to the stature where it stands today. The journey of DPI has been remarkably memorable, dating to 2009, when Aadhaar was  first  launched.  It  is  fourteen  years  now,  and  the  digital  journey  since  then  has  taken the  country  quite  far.  The  three  growth  drivers  that  acted  as  catalysts  for  DPI  growth  were favourable demographics, vast expansion of the middle-class, and digital behaviour patterns. By leveraging these growth drivers, India has built a competitive digital economy that empowers every individual and business to transact paperless and cashless.\n\n12.70 With Aadhaar establishing the authentication framework for verifying the identity of beneficiaries of welfare schemes, the next logical step was to make major government services available digitally. However, a lack of knowledge about the existing schemes was seen as a primary reason behind the beneficiaries' inability to access the schemes' benefits. 'MyScheme' is  an  e-Marketplace  for  schemes  where  users  can  look  for  suitable  schemes  based  on  their eligibility. It helps reduce users' time and effort by doing away with the requirement of searching multiple  websites  of  government  departments  and  studying  multiple  scheme  guidelines  to check their eligibility. The scheme also acts as the single national platform for launching any government scheme. As on 16 January, 2023, more than 181 Central and State/UT government schemes across 14 diverse categories have been hosted on the portal.\n\n13  Data sourced from quarterly Performance Indicator Reports by TRAI (Telecom Regulatory Authority of India)\n\nfigure Xii.11: Myscheme portal provides information on schemes in three easy steps\n\nSource: https://www.myscheme.gov.in/, accessed on 3rd January 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.71 To  reduce  the  search  cost  for  the  commoners,  the  government  launched  Unified Mobile Application  for  New-Age  Governance  (UMANG),  which  enables  citizens  to  access e-Government services offered by the Central and State Government in various sectors such as  agriculture,  education,  health,  housing,  employees,  pensioners,  and  students'  welfare,  the Public Distribution System, and others. Until 16 January 2023, UMANG catered to about 21,869 services (1,672 Central and State Govt. services and 20197 Bill Payment services) under 310+ departments of Central Government and departments of 34 States/UTs. Over 4.9 crore users are registered and benefiting from services on UMANG. Four hundred and eighty-nine DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) schemes were made live on UMANG until September 2022. During the trying times of Covid-19, UMANG was instrumental in making available the services of EPFO for claims related to Covid-19. Around 4.9 lakh advance claims in EPFO have been raised via the UMANG Platform until September 2022.\n\n12.72 While the initiatives mentioned above focused on bringing the government to the doorsteps of the citizens, a unique initiative that deserves special mention is the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC). ONDC aims to go beyond the current platform-centric digital commerce model where the buyer and seller can use the same platform or application for transactions. ONDC is a network-based open protocol that would connect all the buyers and sellers on the network thus bringing better visibility across the Business-to-Consumer (B2C) &amp; Business-to-Business (B2B) landscape.  In  the  ONDC  framework,  consumers  can  potentially  discover  any  seller,  product, or service by using any compatible application or platform. This will increase the freedom of choice for the consumers and will enable them to match demand with the nearest available supply, allowing them to choose their preferred local businesses. ONDC's beta test in the city of Bengaluru is a major first step in operationalising a network approach to e-commerce as an alternative to a platform-centric approach. The open network system will make the e-Commerce landscape more inclusive, accessible, and experience-driven for all consumers and sellers, especially for small businesses that will exercise more freedom in business decision-making.\n\n- 12.73 The government is also cognizant of the need to improve the productivity of human capital.  In  order  to  promote  open  collaborative  software  development  of  e-governance applications, a platform called OpenForge has been developed. Through OpenForge, the use of open-source software and sharing and reuse of e-governance-related source code is promoted. As on 16 January 2023, there are 10,328 users on the platform, with 2,205 projects 14 .\n- 12.74 Another important domain that the government has emphasised is the availability of open resources on Artificial Intelligence (AI). The national AI portal has been developed with a view to strengthening the AI ecosystem in the country by pooling together and highlighting the latest developments happening in Central and State Governments, industry, academia, NGOs, and civil societies. As on 16 January 2023, it has published 1724 articles, 829 news items, 276 videos, 127 research reports, and 120 government initiatives, all related to AI.\n- 12.75 In a country such as India, with its unmatched linguistic and cultural diversity, AI has great potential as a tool for overcoming the language barrier. 'Bhashini', the National Language Translation Mission, aiming at nurturing Indian language technologies and solutions as a public good, was launched in July 2022. The Digital India Bhashini portal 15 is a public digital platform on which 260 open-source API-based AI models are available for speech-to-text conversion, machine  translation,  and  text-to-speech  conversion  in  11  Indian  languages  and  English  for various purposes. Bhashini has great potential to bring access to the internet and other digital resources to millions of Indians in their own languages.\n- 12.76 The digital landscape is a fast-changing one with overarching technologies arriving at the  doorstep  of  consumers  and  businesses.  The  third  generation  in  web  technologies,  'Web 3.0' is one such example where in the entire experience of the internet is changing in the way how it will be used, how websites are managed, and how internet services are provided. The horizons of internet use have broadened, and so has their deployment of better standards. The Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) is one such set of standards that is being hailed as a major shift in how lending and borrowing will be conducted in the future. This is another good initiative towards democratising lending operations and thus ensuring that small borrowers are able to avail themselves of the best terms under which credit is available.\n- 12.77 Today, we have a powerful story on digital public infrastructure that is finding global resonance. The increasing digital adoption during covid-19 in areas like healthcare, agriculture, FinTech, education, and skilling indicates that the digital delivery of services in India has a massive potential across economic sectors. It is usually suggested that developing countries must follow global best practices. However, how India has created and harnessed its DPI is capturing the attention of many nations globally. Low-cost accessibility (Aadhaar), the success of citizen-centric services like Unified Payments Interface (UPI), large-scale adoption and reach (DigiLocker, MyGov), and the vaccine journey through Co-Win are important and successful milestones in India's public digital infrastructure journey.\n\n14 As per https://openforge.gov.in/ , last accessed 4 January 2023.\n\n15 https://bhashini.gov.in\n\n## Box Xii.6: unified Payments interface - the game changer in real-time payments!\n\n'I  like  how  you've  brought  out  the  rising  popularity  of  UPI.  I  laud  my  fellow  Indians  for embracing digital payments! They've shown remarkable adaptability to tech and innovation'\n\n## shri narendra Modi, hon'ble PM\n\nUnified Payments Interface (UPI) is a system that empowers and knits multiple bank accounts into a single mobile application (of any participating bank), merging several banking features, seamless fund routing and merchant payments into one hood. It also caters to the 'Peer to Peer' collection request, which can be scheduled and paid as per requirement and convenience.\n\nIntroduced  in  2016  to  revolutionize  the  payment  landscape  through  universal  operability, single payment address, and low-cost mobile-first payment system, UPI has acted as a positive disruption towards enabling greater digital payments adoption in the country.  UPI is a single mobile  application  for  accessing  different  bank  accounts.  It  can  be  accessed  on  all  major platforms, such as Android and iOS. As the application is user-friendly and fast, consumers and merchants have displayed a great affinity to digital technology, leading to rapid growth in this digital payment infrastructure. The journey of UPI has been fascinating. The number of banks that became part of the real-time payment system increased from 35 in December 2017 to more than 380 in December 2022. Though pre-existing payment modes such as debit cards, credit  cards,  National  Electronic  Funds Transfer  (NEFT)  and  Real-Time  Gross  Settlement (RTGS) have grown over time, UPI has shown a quantum jump comparatively to become one of the preferred modes of payment. In this sense, the progress of UPI has been remarkable.\n\nIn FY19, UPI accounted for 17 per cent of the country's total 3,100 crore digital transactions. The next fiscal year saw UPI's share rise to more than 27 per cent as it processed 1,250 crore transactions out of 4,600 crore digital transactions. In FY22, UPI accounted for 52 per cent of the total 8,840 crore financial digital transactions.\n\nOn average, between FY19-22 (calendar year), growth in UPI-based transactions in value and volume terms have been 121 per cent and 115 per cent, respectively. Recently, in Dec 2022, UPI touched its highest-ever mark with 782 crore transactions worth ₹12.8 lakh crore.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: NPCI\n\nUPI also allows for multiple methods for integrating payments-QR based payments being the most popular. In just 5 years, over 23 crore UPI QRs have been deployed in the market for accepting merchant payments, from only 25 lakhs devices that were accepting merchant payments before this.\n\nThe benefits of UPI became evident during the Covid-19 pandemic when UPI served as a critical lifeline, especially for small and micro merchants. Further, UPI has processed 2,922 crore contactless merchants' transactions with a total value over ₹21.7 lakh crore in FY23 (till December 2022).\n\nThe success of UPI has not been restricted to India alone; NPCI, through its international arm NPCIL is pushing for acceptance of RuPay/UPI powered apps, cross-border remittance and  UPI-Like  deployment  in  international  markets  such  as  Singapore,  UAE,  France,  the Netherlands among others.\n\nInitiative towards the discussion on cross-border remittances will help reduce the cost incurred and  procedures  involved  towards  money  transfer  at  present  by  the  migrant  workers.  The smooth transfer of money will increase the total value of remittances, increasing their impact on  economic  development.  NPCI  has  also  succeeded  in  developing  an  exemplary  robust payments system that is cost-effective, secure, convenient and instantaneous. Several nations have displayed an inclination towards establishing a 'real-time payment system' or 'domestic card scheme' inspired by the exemplary innovations by NPCI in the country.\n\nTech companies are increasingly leveraging the power of UPI to expand the digital ecosystem, which has led to a significant acceleration in the pace of financial inclusion. UPI has opened up many opportunities for start-ups and e-Commerce players to develop innovative solutions that elevate the customer experience. The open systems have enabled global players like Google, WhatsApp, Walmart, True Caller, Amazon, Uber etc., to provide UPI services.\n\nIt is envisioned that the journey of UPI will help accelerate the process of financial inclusion and digital adoption in India by creating a more prosperous and inclusive ecosystem that can accommodate larger sections of the population in times to come.\n\n- 12.78 The introduction of GST, with its end-to-end digitisation of all processes, digitalisation of tax administration, and the faceless e-assessment scheme for Income Tax, have improved governance and formalisation of the economy. The seamless generations of e-way bills and electronic  toll  collections  have  further  augmented  better  tax  collections  for  the  government. It has not just helped in curbing tax evasion but generated trust for small businesses through monitoring compliance.\n- 12.79 The government has also taken initiatives towards empowering individuals with control over their data to access essential services related to finance, health, education, and skills digitally. The Account Aggregator (AA) is a global techno-legal framework that enables individuals to share their financial data quickly and securely, with their consent, with any regulated third-party financial institution of their choice. The AA framework is currently live across over 110 crore of bank accounts.\n\n12.80 Adding to the journey, FY15 can be considered a turning point for the Indian start-up environment. The reforms led by our government, in addition to existing inherent advantages like  demography,  technological  developments,  entrepreneurial  spirit,  and  market  size,  have changed the landscape of the start-up ecosystem in India. The year 2021 marked the completion of five years of the 'Stand-up India' scheme (launched in January 2016), and the numbers - with more than 84,000 recognized start-ups - tell the entire story.  Start-ups have moved past the traditional territory of consumer products and services to much larger value-added services such as satellites.\n\n12.81 India  is  also  geared  to  strengthen  the  up-and-coming  drone  industry.  Under  Mission 'Drone Shakti', the drone start-ups and Drone-as-a-Service (DrAAS) are being promoted. Almost 90 per cent of the airspace has now been opened up as a green zone for flying drones up to 400 feet. A  Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for drones and drone import policy have been notified. Also, the private equity investments in agri-tech space have skyrocketed over the past four years - witnessing an increase of more than 50 per cent per annum to aggregate approximately ₹6600 crore.\n\n12.82 As our digital space widens to bring in newer services, the need for appropriate regulations also becomes paramount. Therefore, techno-smart regulations are the future for digital societies. In  this  regard,  the  governments  worldwide  have  adopted  or  are  introducing  legislation  to provide a foundation for robust data governance. Their policy goals can be complemented and advanced with the help of standard, open, and interoperable protocols that increase the choice of digital services available to a user and enhance user privacy, such as the Data Empowerment &amp; Protection Architecture.",
