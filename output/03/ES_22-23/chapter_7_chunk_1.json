India has contributed only about 4% to cumulative global emissions and maintains its per capita emission at far less than the world average. Despite being less responsible for emissions, India is committed to a low-emission growth pathway with a net-zero emissions goal by 2070.\\n\\nIndia has integrated development goals with ambitious climate action goals, including increasing solar power capacity, energy saving targets, and improving green cover. The country has achieved its target of 40% installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuels ahead of 2030 and has advanced the target to 50%. The National Hydrogen Mission and Green Hydrogen Policy have been introduced to enable India to be energy independent by 2047.\\n\\nThe country has updated its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in line with the Prime Minister's vision, focusing on sustainable lifestyles and climate justice. India aims to reduce its emissions intensity by 45% by 2030 and achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources.\\n\\nIndia's climate actions have been largely financed from domestic sources, but the country needs tens of trillions of US dollars to achieve its climate goals. The government has scaled up efforts to mobilize private capital, including through sovereign green bonds. A framework for green bonds has been issued, complying with International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles.\\n\\nThe country's climate vision is linked to its development goals, including poverty eradication and basic well-being for all citizens. India launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008, establishing eight National Missions. The country has made significant progress on these missions, including increasing solar power capacity and improving energy efficiency.\\n\\nIndia's updated NDC includes eight goals, three of which are quantitative targets to be achieved by 2030. The targets include cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources reaching 40%, reduction in emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35%, and creation of additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\\n\\nThe country aims to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. India's forest and tree cover have shown a steady increase, with a carbon stock of 7,204 million tonnes in 2019. The country has 75 Ramsar sites covering 13.3 lakh ha and has increased its mangrove cover by 364 sq. km.\\n\\nIndia has implemented various measures to conserve and protect the environment, including the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The country has also launched initiatives such as Project Cheetah, the world's first intercontinental large wild carnivore translocation project.\\n\\nIndia has committed to mitigating pollution caused by littered single-use plastics and has banned the manufacture, import, and use of identified single-use plastic items. The country has also notified guidelines on Extended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging and has implemented the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021.\\n\\nThe government has published the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, and the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, to ensure environmentally sound management of waste batteries and e-waste. India aims to promote a circular economy, reduce plastic footprint, and develop new alternatives to plastic packaging.\\n\\nThe country has made significant progress on its climate goals, including enhancing its non-fossil fuel-based installed capacity target to 50%. India has also evolved its sustainable finance framework, extending the requirement to 1,000 top listed companies on a mandatory basis. The country needs to dedicate resources to climate change, in addition to its development goals. Obligations on climate should be matched with on-time availability of climate finance, technology, and inputs like critical minerals.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# Climate Change and Environment: Preparing to Face the Future\n\n## Climate Change and environment: PreParing to FaCe the Future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nClimate change is primarily attributed to disproportionately high cumulative emissions, both historical  and  high  per  capita  annual  emissions  of  greenhouse  gases  (GHGs)  of the developed countries. The global nature of the problem makes India one of the most vulnerable regions despite having contributed only about 4 per cent in the cumulative global  emissions  (for  the  period  1850-2019)  and  maintaining  its  per  capita  emission at  far  less  than  the  world  average.  While  India  is  less  responsible  for  the  high  stock of  emissions, however, it has consistently engaged in demonstrating global leadership towards adopting various measures and ensuring a low-emission growth pathway with a commitment to the net-zero emissions goal by 2070.\n\nIndia has integrated the development goals with ambitious climate action goals, be it in the form of augmented solar power capacity (installed), higher energy saving targeting notified in P AT cycle-VII, improved green cover facilitated by Green India Mission, among other targeted Government actions. As part of dedicated efforts to preserve ecosystems, India  now  has  75  Ramsar  sites  for  wetlands,  in  addition  to  various  regulatory  and promotional measures to protect and conserve mangroves. Continued river conservation and  rejuvenation  efforts  are  underway  through  Namami  Gange  and  National  River Conservation Plan (NRCP).\n\nIn August 2022, the country updated the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in  line  with  the  Hon'ble  PM' s  vision  expressed  in  the  26th  meeting  of  the  Conference of  Parties of UNFCCC. In terms of transition to renewable energy sources, India has already achieved its target of 40 per cent installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuels ahead of 2030. It has advanced the target to 50 per cent, which shall also translate to a significant reduction in the average emission rate. The National Hydrogen Mission and Green Hydrogen Policy have been introduced to enable India to be energy independent by 2047. Its pivotal role is also reflected in India' s Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS).\n\nThe availability of adequate and affordable finance remains a constraint in India's climate actions. The country has so far largely met its requirements from domestic sources only. Finance is a critical input for its climate actions. Therefore, the country has scaled up its efforts towards mobilising private capital, including through sovereign green bonds, to meet climate action goals. A framework for the latter has been issued in compliance with International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (2021).\n\nIndia's  initiatives  on  the  international  stage  have  been  noteworthy.  The  country  has actively engaged in global actions by championing the formation and strengthening of various intergovernmental organisations.",
