  "content": "Chapter 2 Summary:\nThe Indian economy has undergone significant structural and governance reforms from 2014 to 2022, enhancing its overall efficiency. Despite balance sheet stress caused by a credit boom in previous years and global shocks, the economy is well-positioned to grow faster in the coming decade. The reforms focused on creating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, co-partnering with the private sector, and improving agricultural productivity. India's growth outlook seems better than in the pre-pandemic years, with a potential growth rate of 6.5% in the medium term, which could rise to 7-8% if further reforms are pursued. The economy has started benefiting from efficiency gains due to formalization, financial inclusion, and digital technology-based economic reforms. A fresh credit cycle has begun, evident from double-digit growth in bank credit. The government has introduced policies to support domestic industrialization, including the Production Linked Incentives (PLI) scheme, and has liberalized foreign investment policies. The digital economy has grown at 2.4 times the overall economic growth between 2014 and 2019. Financial inclusion has increased, with 78% of the population covered with bank accounts in 2019-21. Digital public goods, such as Aadhar, have supported financial inclusion and formalization. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has enhanced the ease of doing business, and the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) has transformed the real estate sector. The government has also introduced trust-based governance reforms, such as decriminalization of minor economic offenses and simplification of regulatory frameworks. Taxation ecosystem reforms have reduced the tax burden on individuals and businesses, and GST has helped businesses by reducing compliances and ensuring a free flow of goods across states. The Indian economy is expected to benefit from the diversification of global supply chains, with multinational firms exploring strategies to diversify their production bases and supply chains. India's growth potential can be further enhanced by pursuing reforms to address structural challenges, such as power sector issues, education, and skilling.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# India's Medium-term Growth Outlook: With Optimism and Hope\n\n## IndIa's MedIuM-TerM GrowTh ouTlook: wITh opTIMIsM and hope\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2014-2022 is an important period in the economic history of India. The economy underwent a  gamut  of  wide-ranging  structural  and  governance  reforms  that  strengthened  the economy's fundamentals by enhancing its overall efficiency. With an underlying emphasis on improving the ease of living and doing business, the reforms were based on the broad principles of creating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, co-partnering with the private sector for development, and improving agricultural productivity. Under normal circumstances, reforms of such scale and relevance would have accelerated economic growth. However, largely due to the balance sheet stress caused by the credit boom in the previous years and secondarily due to the one-off global shocks that followed, key macroeconomic variables such as credit growth, capital formation, and hence economic growth were adversely impacted during this period. Further, some reforms deliver results with lagged effects as their diffusion in the economy takes time.\n\nThis situation is analogous to the period 1998-2002 when transformative reforms undertaken by the government had lagged growth returns due to temporary shocks in the economy. Once these shocks faded, the structural reforms paid growth dividends from 2003. Similarly, in the present decade, the presence of strong medium-term growth magnets gives us optimism and hope that once these global shocks of the pandemic and the spike in commodity prices in 2022 fade away, the Indian economy is well placed to grow faster in the coming decade. With improved and healthier balance sheets of the banking, non-banking and corporate sectors,  a  fresh  credit  cycle  has  already  begun,  evident  from  the  double-digit  growth  in bank credit over the past months. Additionally, the economy has started benefiting from the efficiency gains resulting from greater formalisation, higher financial inclusion, and economic opportunities created by digital technology-based economic reforms. Thus, India' s growth outlook seems better than in the pre-pandemic years, and the Indian economy is prepared to grow at its potential in the medium term.",
