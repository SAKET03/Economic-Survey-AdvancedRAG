  "content": "Chapter 8 Summary:\nThe agriculture and allied sector has been performing well, with an average annual growth rate of 4.6% over the last six years. In 2021-22, the sector grew by 3.0% compared to 3.3% in 2020-21. India has emerged as a net exporter of agricultural products, with exports reaching an all-time high of $50.2 billion in 2021-22. The government has taken measures to promote farmer-producer organizations, encourage crop diversification, and improve productivity in agriculture through support for mechanization and the creation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme has provided income support to farmers, leading to diversification in sources of farmers' income and improving their resilience to weather shocks. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) has been implemented to provide food security, with 81.4 crore beneficiaries receiving free foodgrains for one year from January 1, 2023. The government has also taken initiatives to enhance credit availability, facilitate mechanization, and boost horticulture and organic farming. The animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries sectors have been recognized as emerging sectors, with the government providing support for their development. The chapter discusses various policy initiatives, including the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure returns over the cost of production, and the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) to provide short-term credit to farmers at subsidized interest rates. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) has been introduced to provide hassle-free credit availability to farmers, with 3.89 crore KCCs issued as of December 30, 2022. The government has also promoted organic farming, with 44.3 lakh organic farmers and 59.1 lakh hectares of area brought under organic farming by 2021-22. The chapter highlights the importance of the agriculture sector in India's growth and development, with a focus on sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nSubchapter 9 Content:\n# Food Processing Sector-The Sunrise Sector\n\n## Food Processing sector-the sunrise sector\n\n8.25  The food processing sector is of enormous significance for India's development because of the strong connections and interactions it promotes between industry and agriculture. During the last five years ending FY21, the food processing industries sector has been growing at an average annual growth rate of around 8.3 per cent. As per the latest Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) 2019-20, 12.2 per cent of persons in the registered manufacturing sector were employed in the food processing sector. The value of agri-food exports, including processed food exports, was about 10.9 per cent of India's total exports during 2021-22.\n\n8.26  With  the  growing  importance  of  processed  food  items  in  the  consumer  basket,  new horizons are now open for both the agriculture and the industry sector pushing diversification and commercialisation in farming, improvement in the efficiency of resource use, enhancement in  the  income  of  farmers,  expansion  in  the  avenues  to  export  agro  foods  and  generation  of employment opportunities. Optimum development of the food processing sector will contribute significantly to tackling several developmental concerns such as disguised rural unemployment in  agriculture,  rural  poverty,  food  security,  food  inflation,  improved  nutrition,  prevention  of wastage of food etc.\n\n8.27  To facilitate the unfettered growth of the food processing sector, there is a continuous need for extensive investment in cold chain infrastructure and address logistical challenges. The  NITI Aayog  Strategy  for  New  India  identifies  the  lack  of  adequate  and  efficient  cold chain  infrastructure  as  a  critical  supply-side  bottleneck  that  leads  to  massive  post-harvest losses (mostly of perishables) estimated at ₹92,561 crore annually 4 .  The uneven geographic distribution of cold storage infrastructure also contributes to regional-level disparities. Given that countries worldwide have stringent guidelines for importing food and agricultural products, the probability of exports from India getting rejected increases with the lack of adequate cold chain infrastructure. Further, logistical barriers relating to connectivity also pose supply-side challenges. For instance, Indian national highways, while accounting for 2 per cent of the total road network, carry 40 per cent of all cargo - exemplifying the burden on the existing road networks and potential for congestion, which is detrimental to food (and particularly perishables) transport.\n\n8.28  Recognising the abundant potential of the sector, the Government has been at the forefront with various interventions aimed at the development of food processing in the country. The Ministry of Food Processing Industries, through the component schemes of Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY), provide financial assistance for the overall growth and development of the food processing sector. Under PMKSY, 677 projects have been completed till 31 December 2022. The Ministry also launched in 2020 the Prime Minister's Formalisation of  Micro  Food  Processing  Enterprises  (PMFME)  Scheme  as  part  of  the  ANB  Abhiyan  to enhance the competitiveness of individual micro-enterprises in the unorganised segment and promote the formalisation of this sector by providing financial, technical and business support for upgradation/setting up of 2 lakh micro units in the country. As of 31 December 2022, 15,095 loans  of  ₹1402.6  crore  were  sanctioned.  The  scheme  adopts  the  One  District  One  Product\n\n(ODOP) approach to reap the benefit of scale in procuring inputs, using shared services and marketing products. So far, 713 Districts with 137 unique products were approved under the ODOP in 35 States/ UTs.\n\n8.29  The  Production  Linked  Incentive  Scheme  for  Food  Processing  Industry  (PLISFPI), launched in March 2022, has the specific mandate to incentivise investments to create global food champions. Sectors with high growth potential, like marine products, processed fruits &amp; vegetables, and 'Ready to Eat/ Ready to Cook' products, are covered for support. In phase -I, 149  applications  have  been  selected  for  assistance  under  the  PLISFPI.  Subsequently,  a  PLI Scheme for millet-based products was also introduced with an outlay of ₹800 crore. In phase-II, 33 applications (both organic and millet products) have been selected.\n\n8.30  To focus on transporting perishable food products, including horticulture, fishery, livestock and processed products, from the Hilly Areas, North-Eastern States and Tribal Areas, Krishi UDAN 2.0 version was launched in October 2021 as a six-month pilot project. The Airports Authority of India (AAI) provides a full waiver of Landing, Parking, Terminal Navigational Landing Charges (TNLC) and Route Navigation Facility Charges (RNFC) for Indian freighters and P2C (Passenger-to-Cargo) aircraft. The scheme covers around 25 airports focusing on North Eastern, Hilly and Tribal regions and 28 airports in other regions/areas. Thus, the scheme assists farmers in transporting agricultural products and improves value realisation.\n\n## Food security- social &amp; legal commitment to the People of the nation\n\n8.31  Food security is not only a question of the ability to produce food but also of the ability to access food. The Government is currently running the most extensive legislation-based food security programme in the world, covering about 80 crore of India's population under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013. The food management programme in India comprises procurement of food grains from farmers at remunerative prices, distribution of food grains to consumers, particularly the vulnerable sections of society, at affordable prices and maintenance of food buffer stock for food security and price stability. Till December 2022, the NFSA provided, for coverage of up to 75 per cent of the rural and up to 50 per cent of the urban population highly subsidised food grains at ₹1/2/3 per kg for coarse grains/ wheat/rice, respectively, at the rate of 35 kg per family per month to households covered under Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and at the rate of 5 kg per person per month to priority households. In a recent decision, the government has decided to provide free foodgrains to about  81.35  crore  beneficiaries  under  the  NFSA  for  one  year  from  January  1,  2023.  To remove the financial burden of the poor, the government will spend more than ₹2 lakh crore in this period on food subsidies under NFSA and other welfare schemes. Under this, the Government will provide 5 kg of foodgrains per person to Priority Households (PHH) beneficiaries  and  35  kg  per  household  to  Antyodaya  Anna  Yojana  (AAY)  beneficiaries (poorest of the poor) free of cost for the next year.\n\n8.32  Procurement from farmers for this programme is at MSP. During Kharif Marketing Season (KMS) 2021-22, 581.7 lakh metric tons (LMT) of Rice was procured against an estimated target of 532.7 LMT. In the current year, KMS 2022-23, a total of 355 LMT of rice has been procured up to 31 December 2022. Also, during Rabi Marketing Season (RMS) 2022-23, 187.9 LMT\n\nwheat was procured against 433.4 LMT procured during RMS 2021-22. The procurement was lower as the market price of wheat was higher than its MSP during its procurement season. During 2022-23, the Government of India allocated 970.1 lakh tons of foodgrains to States/UTs under NFSA and Other Welfare Schemes, etc.\n\nFigure VIII.9: Allocation of Foodgrains under nFsA and other Welfare schemes in 2022-23 and as of 1 January 2023 (lMt)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Department of Food and Public Distribution.\n\n8.33  To ease the hardships faced by the poor due to economic disruption caused by Covid-19, the Government initially launched Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) for the period from April to June 2020. However, keeping in view the need for continuous support to the poor and the needy, the scheme has been extended and implemented in various phases (Phase VII is the latest covering October-December,2022). Under the scheme, 5 kg of additional food grains per person per month has been/is being provided free of cost to NFSA beneficiaries in  all  the  phases.  Under  the  PM-GKAY scheme ( covering all phases), the Government has allocated about 1,118 LMT foodgrains to the States/UTs.\n\n8.34  To further ease the process of access to food, the Government launched a citizen-centric and  technology-driven  scheme  in  2019  called  the  One  Nation  One  Ration  Card  (ONORC) scheme. The ONORC system enables intra-State and inter-State portability of ration cards. It helps the migrant beneficiaries access their food security entitlements from any fair price shop (FPS) of their choice by using the same ration card after biometric/Aadhaar authentication on electronic Point of Sale (e-PoS) devices at the FPS. Presently, the national/inter-State portability is enabled in all 36 States/UT, covering 100 per cent of the total NFSA population.\n\n8.35  The food subsidy bill was higher during 2020-21 and 2021-22 in comparison to other years as a result of the free food distribution programme of the government under the PMGKAY. This dedicated support was provided to ensure that the farmers and vulnerable households remained protected from the Covid-19 led shocks.\n\nFigure VIII.10: total Food subsidy released by the government of India since 2014-15.
