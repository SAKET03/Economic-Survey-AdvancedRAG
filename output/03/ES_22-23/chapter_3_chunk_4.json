See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Union Budget for FY23 was presented in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, with the government adopting a fiscal policy response to the crisis comprising increased food and fertilizer subsidies and reduced taxes on fuel and imported products. Despite additional fiscal pressures, the Union Government is on track to achieve the budget estimate for the fiscal deficit in FY23. The Gross Tax Revenue registered a YoY growth of 15.5% from April to November 2022, driven by robust growth in direct taxes and Goods and Services Tax (GST). The growth in direct taxes during the first eight months of the year was much higher than their corresponding longer-term averages. The GST has stabilized as a vital revenue source for central and state governments, with gross GST collections increasing at 24.8% on a YoY basis during April-December 2022.\\n\\nOn the expenditure side, the Union Government's emphasis on capital expenditure (Capex) has continued, with Capex steadily increasing from a long-term average of 1.7% of GDP (FY09 to FY20) to 2.5% of GDP in FY22 PA. The Centre has also incentivized State Governments through interest-free loans and enhanced borrowing ceilings to prioritize their spending on Capex. The increase in Capex has large-scale positive implications for medium-term growth. The government's fiscal policy response necessitated additional spending on food and fertilizer subsidies, accompanied by specific duty cuts to control the pass-through of high imported prices to consumers/users.\\n\\nThe fiscal deficit of the Union Government, which reached 9.2% of GDP during the pandemic year FY21, has moderated to 6.7% of GDP in FY22 PA and is further budgeted to reach 6.4% of GDP in FY23. The resilience in the fiscal performance of the Union Government has been facilitated by the recovery in economic activity, buoyancy in revenues from direct taxes and GST, and realistic assumptions in the Budget. The Gross Tax Revenue (GTR) to the Centre was envisaged to grow at 9.6% in FY23 BE relative to FY22 RE, but given the higher 'Provisional Actual' figures recorded for the GTR relative to the Revised estimates in FY22, the growth in GTR of FY23 BE turns out to be a mere 1.8% over FY22 PA.\\n\\nThe annual estimate of GTR for FY23 is expected to overshoot the budget estimates, with GTR growing at a much higher rate (15.5%) from April to November 2022. Direct taxes, which broadly constitute half of the Gross Tax Revenue, have registered a YoY growth of 26% from April to November 2022, enabled by corporate and personal income tax growth. Customs and excise duties have acted as flexible policy tools during the fiscal response to the pandemic, with the government raising excise duty on petrol and diesel to augment the revenue pool and subsequently reducing it to control inflationary pressures.\\n\\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) has evolved and stabilized as a vital revenue source for central and state governments, with gross GST collections growing at 24.8% on a YoY basis during April-December 2022. The improvement in GST collections is due to the combined effect of rapid economic recovery post-pandemic, nationwide drive against GST evaders and fake bills, and various rate rationalization measures undertaken by the GST Council. The number of GST taxpayers has doubled, increasing from nearly 70 lakh in 2017 to more than 1.4 crore in 2022.\\n\\nThe Union government's non-debt receipts comprise revenue receipts (tax and non-tax) and non-debt capital receipts. The shortfall in non-debt receipts to meet expenditure requirements is met by borrowings of the government (fiscal deficit). The government has reaffirmed its commitment towards privatization and strategic disinvestment of Public Sector Enterprises by implementing the New Public Sector Enterprise Policy and Asset Monetization Strategy. The government has provided 50-year interest-free loans to state governments under the 'Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment' for the last three years, with an allocation of ₹1.05 lakh crore for FY23.\\n\\nThe Centre's capital expenditure has steadily increased from a long-term average of 1.7% of GDP (FY09 to FY20) to 2.5% of GDP in FY22 PA, and is further budgeted to increase to 2.9% of GDP in FY23. The government's thrust on capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure-intensive sectors like roads and highways, railways, and housing and urban affairs, has longer-term implications for growth. The capital expenditure by the Centre registered a YoY growth of over 60% from April to November 2022, much higher than the long-term average growth of 13.5% recorded in the corresponding period from FY16 to FY20.\\n\\nThe revenue expenditure of the Union government was brought down from 15.6% of GDP in the pandemic year FY21 to 13.5% of GDP in FY22 PA. However, due to the sudden outbreak of geopolitical conflict, there was a higher food and fertilizer subsidy requirement, and the revenue expenditure from April to November 2022 has grown by over 10% on a YoY basis. Interest payments as a proportion of receipts went up after the pandemic outbreak, but are expected to come down in the medium term as the government moves along the fiscal glide path.\\n\\nThe General Government finances give an overview of the fiscal position of the Government sector as a whole. The General Government liabilities as a proportion of GDP increased steeply during FY21 on account of additional borrowings made by Centre and States on account of the pandemic. However, the ratio has come off its peak in FY22 (RE). The General Government deficits as a percent of GDP have also consolidated after their peak in FY21. The General Government is expected to follow the path of fiscal consolidation in the medium term.\\n\\nA positive growth-interest rate differential keeps the Government Debt sustainable, with India's public debt profile relatively stable and characterized by low currency and interest rate risks. The weighted average maturity of the outstanding stock of dated securities of the government has increased from 9.7 years in end-March 2010 to 11.71 years in end-March 2022, reducing rollover risk in the medium-term. The growth-interest rate differential has historically been positive for India, keeping debt levels sustainable.\\n\\nA counterfactual experiment shows that sustained growth of 10% per annum would have resulted in much lower Union Government deficit and debt ratios for India in the post-pandemic years, despite keeping the expenditure levels the same. There is a need for continued vigilance and adherence to the path of fiscal prudence, but an undue alarm is unwarranted. The Centre should continue incentivizing States for reforms and higher capital spending to ensure a stronger General government, and the capex-led growth strategy will ensure sustainable debt levels in the medium term.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Overview of State Government Finances\n\n## Overview of State Government Finances\n\n## performance of state finances\n\n3.25  State Governments improved their finances in FY22 after being adversely impacted by the pandemic in FY21. The combined Gross Fiscal Deficit (GFD) of the States, which increased to  4.1  per  cent  of  GDP  in  the  pandemic-affected year, was brought down to 2.8 per cent in FY22 PA. Given the geopolitical uncertainties, the consolidated GFD-GDP ratio for States has been budgeted 3.4 per cent in FY23 (Figure III.11). However, the States' monthly fiscal Accounts data released by O/o CAG shows that from April- November 2022, the combined borrowings of the 27 major states have just reached 33.5 per cent of their total budgeted borrowings for the year. (Figure III.12)\n\n5 https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=136996\n\n6 https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=153672\n\nFigure III.11: Consolidation of States' Deficits as per cent of GDp\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure III.12: Lower States' Combined Fiscal deficit during April-November\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI Study of State Budgets Jan 2023, O/o CAG\n\nNote: Figure 12 includes data for 27 states\n\n3.26  It is pertinent to note that states had unutilised borrowing limits during the last three years. Given the resource constraints of state governments, the Centre enhanced the net borrowing ceilings (NBC) for States to 5 per cent of GSDP in FY21, 4 per cent of GSDP in FY22, and 3.5 per cent of GSDP in FY23.\n\n3.27  As per FY23 Budget Estimates of the State Governments, the States' combined own Tax revenue and own Non-Tax revenue were anticipated to grow at 17.5 per cent and 25.6 per cent, respectively, over FY22 RE. This growth is a continuation of the buoyancy momentum observed in the FY22 RE. On the expenditure side, revenue and capital expenditures in FY22 BE were envisaged  to  grow  at  10.4  per  cent  and  16  per  cent,  respectively,  over  FY22  RE.  The  RBI Study on State Finances highlights that the Capital outlay, a part of the capital expenditure, has recorded a higher growth in Provisional Actuals than that estimated in the Revised estimates. The capital outlay of States grew by 31.7 per cent in FY22 PA. This increase is attributable to strong revenue buoyancy and the support provided by the Centre in terms of advance releases of payments to the states, GST compensation payments, and interest-free loans. The Centre's initiatives to support State finances are discussed in the forthcoming sections.\n\n## Cooperative fiscal federalism drives a well-targeted fiscal policy\n\n## Transfer from Centre to States\n\n3.28  Transfer of funds to the States comprises the share of States in Union taxes devolved to the States, Finance Commission Grants, Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), and other transfers. Total transfers to States have risen between FY19 and FY23 BE (refer to Table III.6).\n\nTable III.6: Details of transfers from Centre to States (other than devolution to States)\n\n|                              | FY19   | FY20   | FY21   | FY22 RE           | FY23 BE           |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                              |        |        |        | (in ₹ lakh crore) | (in ₹ lakh crore) |\n| Centrally Sponsored Schemes  | 3.0    | 3.1    | 3.8    | 4.2               | 4.4               |\n| Finance Commission Grants    | 0.9    | 1.2    | 1.8    | 2.1               | 1.9               |\n| Other Grants/Loans/Transfers | 0.9    | 2.0    | 1.9    | 2.3               | 3.0               |\n\nSource: Union budget documents\n\n3.29  The Finance Commission had recommended allocation of an amounting to ₹1.92 lakh crore for FY23 in respect of post-devolution revenue deficit grants, grants to local bodies, health sector grants, and disaster management grants under Article 275 of the Constitution.

To meet the shortfall in GST compensation for States, the Government, in addition to the release of regular GST compensation from the Fund, borrowed ₹ 2.69 lakh crore during FY21 and FY22 and passed it on to States on a back-to-back basis. Moreover, the cess payments and tax devolution instalments to the States were frontloaded to give them early access to funds. During FY23, the Government of India released ₹1.16 lakh crore towards the total GST compensation payable to States up to 30 June 2022 (as of 25 November 2022). Even though the total Cess collection until November 2022 was insufficient to make this entire payment to the States, the Centre released the balance from its resources. Box III.3 discusses the impact of GST on the flow of resources to the states.\n\n## Box III.3: GST and the flow of resources to states\n\nThe last five years of experience with GST have seen several rounds of policy debates around rate rationalisation, simplification of return filing, compensation cess levies on products, compensation payments to states etc. One pertinent question that has not been carefully studied is the impact of GST on the flow of resources to the states. While comparing the total fiscal resources accruing to States\n\nin the pre and post-GST regimes, it is essential to measure the relative performance of taxes vis-à-vis the performance of the economy. In the pre-GST regime, when the economy grew at 11.5 per cent nominally, the total fiscal resources accruing to States from the Central and state taxes subsumed in GST (including devolution) grew at 11.1 per cent. It implied a buoyancy of 0.97 (See table 3A).\n\nTable 3A- Pre-GST period - Total fiscal resources to States from taxes subsumed in GST (including devolution)\n\n|                                                                           | FY13         | FY14         | FY15         | FY16         | FY17         | CAGR (FY17 over FY13)   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|\n|                                                                           | ₹ lakh crore | ₹ lakh crore | ₹ lakh crore | ₹ lakh crore | ₹ lakh crore | ₹ lakh crore            |\n| State taxes subsumed in GST                                               |              |              |              |              |              |                         |\n| States taxes subsumed in GST                                              | 3.22         | 3.48         | 3.73         | 4.41         | 4.41         |                         |\n| Central taxes subsumed in GST                                             | 1.66         | 1.90         | 2.02         | 2.48         | 3.14         |                         |\n| Devolution factor                                                         | 0.32         | 0.32         | 0.32         | 0.42         | 0.42         |                         |\n| Total fiscal resources to States from taxes subsumed in GST               | 3.75         | 4.08         | 4.38         | 5.46         | 5.73         | 11.1%                   |\n| Nominal GDP                                                               | 99.44        | 112.34       | 124.68       | 137.72       | 153.92       | 11.5%                   |\n| Pre-GST buoyancy of revenue from taxes subsumed in GST accruing to states |              |              |              |              |              | 0.97                    |\n\nIn the post-GST period, total fiscal resources accruing to the states from the GST (including devolution from the Centre's GST) exhibited a buoyancy greater than that in the pre-GST period (Table 3B). This performance is especially noteworthy, considering the reduction of the effective weighted average GST rate from 14.4 per cent at the time of inception to 11.6 per cent in 2019 (RBI).\n\nTable 3B- Post-GST period - Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system (including devolution)\n\n|                                    | FY19         | FY20         | FY21         | FY22         | FY23*        | CAGR (FY23 over FY19)   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|\n|                                    | ₹ lakh crore | ₹ lakh crore | ₹ lakh crore | ₹ lakh crore | ₹ lakh crore | ₹ lakh crore            |\n| CGST collections                   | 2.02         | 2.27         | 2.10         | 2.69         | 3.14         |                         |\n| SGST collections                   | 2.79         | 3.09         | 2.73         | 3.44         | 3.98         |                         |\n| IGST collections                   | 5.99         | 5.87         | 5.66         | 7.62         | 9.40         |                         |\n| GST compensation paid for the year | 0.85         | 1.66         | 1.68         | 0.69         | 0.35         |                         |\n| Back-to-back loans                 |              |              | 1.10         | 1.59         |              |                         |\n\n|                                                                                      | FY19                                                  | FY20                                                  | FY21                                                  | FY22                                                  | FY23*                                                 | CAGR(FY23 over FY19)                                  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system*                                | Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system* | Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system* | Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system* | Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system* | Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system* | Total fiscal resources to states from the GST system* |\n| (1) SGST + IGST for states + Devolution from Centre's GST                            | 7.89                                                  | 8.21                                                  | 7.61                                                  | 9.96                                                  | 11.95                                                 | 10.9%                                                 |\n| (2) SGST + IGST for states + Devolution from Centre's GST + Compensation             | 8.74                                                  | 9.87                                                  | 9.29                                                  | 10.65                                                 | 12.30                                                 | 8.9%                                                  |\n| (3) SGST + IGST for states + Devolution from Centre's GST + Compensation + loans     | 8.74                                                  | 9.87                                                  | 10.39                                                 | 12.24                                                 | 12.30                                                 | 8.9%                                                  |\n| India Nominal GDP                                                                    | 189.00                                                | 200.75                                                | 198.01                                                | 236.65                                                | 273.09                                                | 9.6%                                                  |\n| Post-GST buoyancy of GST revenues accruing to states (excluding compensation/ loans) |                                                       |                                                       |                                                       |                                                       |                                                       | 1.13                                                  |\n\nNote: (a) The devolution factor is taken as 0.32 from FY13 to FY15; 0.42 from FY16 to FY20; and 0.41 from FY21 onwards, as per the recommendation of the respective Finance Commission.\n\n(b) IGST for States is taken as 50% of total IGST collection. State's share in Centre's GST is arrived by multiplying the devolution factor with CGST and Centre's IGST share.\n\n(c) The collection for FY23 have been extrapolated based on the average collections from May to Dec 2022.\n\n(d) The GST collections used are gross collections, including domestic supplies and import. However, with only the GST collections through domestic supplies, the post GST buoyancy is still greater than 1 (=1.05).\n\nIn addition to the regular stream of revenues from GST, a compensation was also provided to the states  in  the  post-GST  period.  Since  GST  was  a  new  tax  regime,  the  compensation  scheme  was designed to safeguard the states for any difference in the new versus the old tax regime by ensuring steady revenue growth of 14 per cent per annum for five years. The compensation arrangement was also meant to help states ride out the differences in the inter-state distribution of GST. It is pertinent to note here that the compensation system was not envisaged as a buffer to the state's revenues in the eventuality of a fall in tax revenues resulting from a collapse in economic growth.\n\nNevertheless, the incidence of the pandemic has highlighted the relevance of GST Compensation as a buffer to the States' revenues. During FY21, revenues for Centre and states were adversely affected due to the economic contraction. The compensation requirement by the states increased substantially amidst a decline in the CGST and the compensation cess collections. Despite having limited fiscal resources in the middle of a crisis, the Centre borrowed funds and passed them on to States on a backto-back loan basis, in addition to the release of regular GST compensation. These loans will be repaid from future inflows into the GST Compensation Cess Fund and hence are not a burden on the states.\n\nTable 3C: Compensation scheme supported the SGST revenues from FY19 to FY23\n\n|                                                         | FY19   | FY20   | FY21                           | FY22                           | FY23*                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n|                                                         |        |        | ₹ lakh crore, unless specified | ₹ lakh crore, unless specified | ₹ lakh crore, unless specified |\n| (1) SGST+ States' share in IGST                         | 5.78   | 6.03   | 5.56                           | 7.25                           | 8.69                           |\n| YoY growth                                              |        | 4.2%   | -7.8%                          | 30.5%                          | 19.8%                          |\n| (2) SGST + States' share in IGST + Compensation         | 6.63   | 7.68   | 7.24                           | 7.94                           | 9.04                           |\n| YoY growth                                              |        | 15.9%  | -5.7%                          | 9.7%                           | 13.5%                          |\n| (3) SGST + States' share in IGST + Compensation + Loans | 6.63   | 7.68   | 8.34                           | 9.53                           | 9.04                           |\n| YoY growth                                              |        | 15.9%  | 8.6%                           | 14.3%                          | -5.2%                          |\n\nNote: (a) * The collection for FY23 have been extrapolated based on the average collections from May to Dec 2022; (b) The YoY growth in all-inclusive SGST, compensation, and loans (Item 3 in Table above) is negative for FY23 since the compensation payments were applicable only till June 2022. Thus, comparing the growth in aggregate SGST (item 1 in the table) is a better measure to gauge the performance of SGST revenues of the States.\n\n(c) The above analysis includes SGST and IGST collections from both domestic supplies and imports. However, if we take the collections on domestic supplies, growth in item 1 of the table is 26.5 per cent in FY22 and 17.3 per cent in FY23.\n\nWe see from the above analysis that the GST regime and its implementation mechanism have not only safeguarded the States' revenues from the initial teething troubles of a new tax system but also protected the States' finances amidst unprecedented external shocks during the last five years. In the absence of GST, Indian states would have had no recourse to compensation, nor could they have contemplated augmenting their revenues through fresh and/or higher levies during a pandemic.\n\nSources: Department of Revenue, RBI, Union budgets, MoSPI, PIB releases\n\n## Enhanced limit of borrowing for the States and incentives for reforms\n\n3.31  Since the pandemic outbreak, the Centre has kept the Net borrowing Ceiling of the State Governments above the Fiscal Responsibility Legislation (FRL) threshold. It was fixed at 5 per cent of GSDP in FY21, 4 per cent of GSDP in FY22 and 3.5 per cent of GSDP in FY23. A part of this additional borrowing was linked to reforms encouraging the States to undertake them. For instance, in FY21, a part of the additional borrowing ceiling was conditional on implementing the 'One Nation One Ration Card' System, ease of doing business reform, urban Local body/ utility reforms, and power sector reforms. As a result, 17 States implemented the One Nation One Ration Card System, 20 States completed the stipulated  reforms  in  the  Ease  of  Doing Business, 11 States had done local body reforms and 17 States carried out fully/partly Power Sector Reforms. Similarly, a part of the additional borrowing was earmarked for incremental capital expenditure to be incurred by States during FY22. Sixteen states accessed the additional borrowings upon meeting the Capex target.\n\n3.32  In addition to the net borrowing ceilings fixed for the States, Fifteenth Finance Commission had recommended performance-based additional borrowing space of 0.50 per cent of Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) to the States in the power sector. This special dispensation has been recommended for each year for four years, from FY22 to 2024-25. For the financial year FY22, additional borrowing permission of ₹39,175 crore was allowed to 12 States for meeting the stipulated reform criteria.\n\n## Centre's support towards States' capital expenditure\n\n3.33  The  Union  government  has  provided  50-year  interest-free  loans  to  state  governments under the 'Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment' for the last three years. Amounts of ₹11,830 crore and ₹14,186 crore were provided to states in FY21 and FY22. A part  of  the  allocation  for  FY22  was  earmarked  for  providing  incentives  to  the  States  for privatisation/disinvestment of the State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) and monetisation/ recycling of assets. During the year FY23, the allocation under the Scheme has been raised to  ₹1.05  lakh  crore  to  give  further  impetus  to  State  Capex  plans.  This  amount  includes  an unconditional component and smaller components linked to specific reforms/initiatives (Table III.8). Notably, if state governments were allowed this ₹1 lakh crore as an additional borrowing limit,  they  would  bear  an  interest  rate  higher  than  the  rate  at  which  the  Union  government borrows. Further, they may use it for revenue expenditure. This interest-free loan in the present arrangement is dedicated only to capital expenditure.\n\nTable III.8: Details of Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment' for FY23\n\n| component   | Basis                                                           | allocated   | approved   | Released (₹ crore)   |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------|----------------------|\n| 1           | Allocation proportional to the share of tax devolution for FY23 | 80000       | 68,592     | 31,571               |\n| II          | PM Gati Shakti-related expenditure                              | 5,000       | 1,458      | 1,458                |\n| III         | PMGSY                                                           | 4,000       | 1,616      | 1,616                |\n| IV          | Incentive for digitisation                                      | 2,000       |            |                      |\n| V           | Optical fiber cable                                             |             | 2,215      | 2,011                |\n| VI          | Urban reforms                                                   | 6,000       |            |                      |\n| VII         | Disinvestment and monetisation                                  | 5,000       |            |                      |\n\nSource: Department of Expenditure\n\n## Box III.4: Initiatives by the State Governments to improve their own resources\n\nThe pandemic has stretched state finances by expanding the expenditure needs and adversely hitting the  revenues.  While  the  Union  Government  has  supported  state  governments  through  the  above initiatives, state governments have also taken steps to enhance their resource pool.\n\nIn its recent report on municipal finances, RBI pointed out that India's property tax collection was much lower than the OECD countries. There is a wide disparity in taxes across the States, thus creating scope for a large-scale reform of property taxation practices in India. States like Tamil Nadu,\n\nTelangana and Kerala have revised the property taxes in their States during the year to support their revenues. 7,8\n\nSome states like Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Kerala, Assam, and UT of Puducherry have considered revising their power tariffs during FY23. On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh has announced a new liquor policy whereby it increased the license fee, renewal fees, processing fee, and registration fee across various categories of liquor/ distilleries. In addition, many States have also made efforts towards privatising SPSEs and Monetising assets in FY21 &amp; FY22 to receive additional incentives from the Union Government. These reforms will lead to unlocking the money trapped in unproductive assets and freeing it up for productive use.\n\nSome other revenue generating measures adopted by the States include Assam's liquidation scheme for payment of arrears, Haryana's one-time scheme for settlement of old VAT dues, and Assam and Kerala's Green tax to discourage old vehicles.\n\nSources: Newspaper reports, RBI",
