  "content": "Chapter 2 Summary:\nThe Indian economy has undergone significant structural and governance reforms from 2014 to 2022, enhancing its overall efficiency. Despite balance sheet stress caused by a credit boom in previous years and global shocks, the economy is well-positioned to grow faster in the coming decade. The reforms focused on creating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, co-partnering with the private sector, and improving agricultural productivity. India's growth outlook seems better than in the pre-pandemic years, with a potential growth rate of 6.5% in the medium term, which could rise to 7-8% if further reforms are pursued. The economy has started benefiting from efficiency gains due to formalization, financial inclusion, and digital technology-based economic reforms. A fresh credit cycle has begun, evident from double-digit growth in bank credit. The government has introduced policies to support domestic industrialization, including the Production Linked Incentives (PLI) scheme, and has liberalized foreign investment policies. The digital economy has grown at 2.4 times the overall economic growth between 2014 and 2019. Financial inclusion has increased, with 78% of the population covered with bank accounts in 2019-21. Digital public goods, such as Aadhar, have supported financial inclusion and formalization. The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has enhanced the ease of doing business, and the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) has transformed the real estate sector. The government has also introduced trust-based governance reforms, such as decriminalization of minor economic offenses and simplification of regulatory frameworks. Taxation ecosystem reforms have reduced the tax burden on individuals and businesses, and GST has helped businesses by reducing compliances and ensuring a free flow of goods across states. The Indian economy is expected to benefit from the diversification of global supply chains, with multinational firms exploring strategies to diversify their production bases and supply chains. India's growth potential can be further enhanced by pursuing reforms to address structural challenges, such as power sector issues, education, and skilling.\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Growth Magnets in this Decade (2023-2030)\n\n## Growth Magnets in this decade (2023-2030)\n\n## India is prepared to grow at its potential once the one-off shocks recede\n\n2.35  After a long period of balance sheet repair in the financial and corporate sector, the financial cycle is poised to turn upward. As the health and economic shocks of the pandemic and the spike in commodity prices in 2022 wear off, the Indian economy is thus well placed to grow at its potential in the coming decade, similar to the growth experience of the economy after 2003. This is the primary reason for expecting India's growth outlook to be better than it was in the pre-pandemic years . The sound and healthy financial system developed over the last few years will ensure efficient credit provisioning, contributing to higher growth in the coming years through higher investments and consumption. Thanks to India's digital revolution and formalisation, banks have far more information about their customer's credit risks than before, thus being able to make credit and pricing decisions better than before. That should make for a healthier and longer credit cycle than before. Bank credit growth has been well into doubledigits for quite some time now. A recent IMF Working paper 27 analyses the trends in the Creditto-GDP ratio gap 28 , bank balance sheets and the GDP growth in India since 2012; and shows that better-capitalised banks result in higher credit growth, which further translates into higher GDP growth.\n\n2.36  The  digitalisation  reforms  and  the  resulting  efficiency  gains  in  terms  of  greater formalisation, higher financial inclusion, and more economic opportunities will be the second most important driver of India's economic growth in the medium term. In its recent Article IV report for India, IMF highlighted that India's successful implementation of the wide-ranging reforms and more than expected dividends from digitalisation could increase India's mediumterm growth potential.  29   These productivity-enhancing reforms along with the Government's Skilling initiatives, will also help unleash the benefits of the demographic dividend in the coming years. In sum, various initiatives undertaken in the last eight years have bolstered India's growth potential, and it will be reflected in actual GDP growth as the effects of one-off the shocks recede.\n\n2.37  The evolving geo-political situation also presents an opportunity for India to benefit from the diversification of global supply chains. The last few years have exposed multinational firms to unprecedented risks due to global trade tensions, pandemic-induced supply chain disruptions, and the conflict in Europe. Firms were exposed to the risk of concentrating their production in  a  single  country.  Therefore,  given  the  global  policy  uncertainty,  multinational  firms  are gradually exploring strategies to diversify their production bases and supply chains. UNCTAD, in one of its reports, shows that 'reshoring, diversification, and regionalisation will drive the restructuring of global value chains in the coming years'. 30  With enabling policy frameworks, India presents itself as a credible destination for capital diversifying out of other countries. 31 32\n\n27 IMF Working paper (WP/22/137)- Financial Sector and Economic Growth in India by Margaux MacDonald;TengTeng Xu (July 2022) (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/07/08/Financial-Sector-and-Economic-Growth-in-India-520580)\n\n28 Difference between actual ratio and its trend value\n\n29 https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/CR/Issues/2022/12/21/India-2022-Article-IV-Consultation-Press-Release-Staff-Report-and-State -ment-by-the-527283\n\n30 UNCTAD  World  Investment  report 2020 (https://unctad.org/news/covid-19-will-likely-transform-global-production-says-un-report; https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/wir2020\\_en.pdf)\n\n31 'Helped by PLI scheme, Apple's India exports set to hit Rs 20,000 crore', Business Standard, December 2022 (https://www.businessstandard.com/article/companies/helped-by-pli-scheme-apple-s-iphone-exports-from-india-hit-record-122121200940\\_1.html)\n\n32 '  India to get more Apple suppliers as iPhone production picks up: Experts', Business Standard, December 2022 (https://www.businessstandard.com/article/technology/india-to-get-more-apple-suppliers-as-iphone-production-picks-up-experts-122121900505\\_1.html)\n\nThe recently published Chief Economists Outlook 2023 (World Economic Forum) highlights India's opportunity to gain from these global trends of supply chain diversification. 33\n\n2.38  While the new age reforms undertaken over the last eight years form the foundation of a resilient, partnership-based governance ecosystem and restore the ability of the economy to grow healthily, further reforms are needed to ensure that economic growth can both accelerate and  be  sustained  at  higher  levels,  to  deliver  a  better  quality  of  life.  The  deregulation  and simplification  of  compliances  should  continue  to  dismantle  the  licensing,  inspection  and compliance regime entirely. State governments have to address power sector issues, and the financial viability concerns of the Discoms have to be addressed. Impetus must be given to education and skilling to match the requirements of modern industry and technologies, deal with twenty-first-century challenges such as climate change and energy transition, and make the most of India's demographic dividend. Initiatives to sensitise the population towards a healthy lifestyle should be continued. Strategies to arrest and reverse the rising obesity levels should be adopted. 34 Long-range plans need to be formulated to secure the necessary metals and minerals required for energy transition and diversification. Determined efforts should be taken to make the public sector asset monetisation scheme successful in realising wide-ranging efficiency gains from the programme. If asset monetisation revenues are used to reduce public sector debt, the sovereign credit rating will improve, leading to a lower cost of capital. That will be the biggest fiscal stimulus to the economy. Reforms to reduce the compliance burden on MSMEs, enhance their access to finance and working capital and equip them with skills, knowledge and attitude to grow their businesses responsibly must continue. State governments should make conclusive progress on the various factor market reforms in different stages of completion.\n\n2.39  In this chapter, we have shown that the Indian economy had not lost its vigour, nor have government reform measures their effectiveness. The Indian economy could have grown faster in the absence of the financial and corporate sector balance sheet stress. Even as we were looking forward to the economy being able to reap the benefits of improved and healthier balance sheets in the new decade, it was buffeted by the global pandemic followed by a sharp rise in the prices of food, fuel and fertiliser. Negative shocks will and do fade, as they did in the early years of the new millennium. Now, financial and corporate sector balance sheets are in good shape, and there is a willingness to borrow and lend. Hence, it is inevitable that the effects of these reforms will now shine through. A restored credit cycle will rejuvenate the Indian private sector capex cycle. That alone is adequate to enable India to grow at least 6 per cent per annum in real terms. On top of that, the higher economic efficiency resulting from the public digital infrastructure created over the last 6-7 years will also add 30- 50 basis points to the potential GDP growth. The growth effects of the maturation of India's public digital infrastructure are insufficiently understood. Formalisation and financial inclusion that it has enabled are too evident to be ignored. It is a matter of time before its growth effects become persistent in the data. That is why we are optimistic that India will achieve an average of 6.5 per cent real GDP growth in the medium term. In addition, if the other reforms explained in the previous paragraph are pursued in the coming years, India's potential GDP growth can rise to 7-8 per cent per annum in the medium term.\n\n33 Chief Economists Outlook 2023 (World economic Forum)- https://www.weforum.org/reports/chief-economists-outlook-jan-2023\n\n34 As per National Family Health Survey 5, Obesity is rising for both men and women across all states .",
