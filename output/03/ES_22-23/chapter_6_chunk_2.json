Realising  the  immense  potential  harboured  by  the  young  and aspirational  citizens  spanning  numerous  cities  and  villages  requires  ambitious  vision  and meticulous implementation, customising for the diversity of circumstances and special needs of different sections. The foundational services and structures that support society in availing various amenities important for a better quality of life, i.e the social infrastructure, indirectly contributes to economic development by laying the foundation for enhancement in income and employment  opportunities,  productivity  growth,  and  technological  advancement.  That  said, quality employment opportunities and working conditions are the essential instruments to chisel this potential into long-term sustainable growth. In its Amrit Kaal for the next 25 years, India envisions rewarding itself with the dividends that can come from demographics.\n- 6.2 With the overall development of the economy, the concept of quality of life has enlarged to  include  many  more  elements  than  the  traditional  metrics  of  income  (which  determine the availability of basic requirements such as food and shelter) and education levels. It now encompasses access  to  clean  drinking  water,  sanitation,  employment  prospects,  health  care, social  security,  connectivity,  etc.  All  these  together  determine  the  quality  of  life.  Research studies have concluded that quality of life depends upon the fulfilment of basic needs and being able to live in an affable environment. 1 Cognisant of this fact, the Government places a high priority on the development of the social infrastructure of the country.\n- 6.3 This is all the more pertinent in the contemporary scenario as India has adopted the UN SDGs 2030, which are a set of comprehensive, far-reaching, and people-centric universal and transformative goals and targets. Many of these seventeen goals concern the social well-being of individuals, resolving as follows:\n- 'We resolve,  between  now  and  2030,  to  end  poverty  and  hunger  everywhere;  to  combat  inequalities within and among countries; to build peaceful, just, and inclusive societies; to protect human rights and promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls; and to ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources. We resolve also to create conditions for sustainable, inclusive and sustained economic growth, shared prosperity and decent work for all, taking into account different levels of national development and capacities.' 2\n- 6.4 The country continues to make good progress in increasing incomes and improving the standard of living over the past decades. As detailed in the chapter, many social indicators have continued to improve. The years 2020 and 2021 were the peak years of the pandemic, which tested the strength of the country's social and health infrastructure, hampering education, loss of job opportunities, etc. Several measures were taken to meet the growing needs of the health pandemic during this time, extending into 2022. FY23 has been a year of rejuvenation for the sector, having withered the storm of the pandemic and come out stronger. Various dimensions of the sector are recouping lost grounds and are on the path of reenergising to meet the vision of ' sabka sath, sabka vikas and sabka vishwas'.\n\n1 For example: Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen, ed. (1993). The Quality of Life, Oxford: Clarendon Press. and Barcaccia, Barbara (4 September 2013). 'Quality of Life: Everyone Wants It, But What Is It?'. Forbes/ Education.\n\n2  Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 25 September 2015\n\n6.5 India  is  entering  the  Amrit  Kal  with  better-equipped  schools,  affordable  healthcare, increasing  formal  employment,  empowered  women's  collectives,  and  far-reaching  access  to basic amenities such as sanitation, drinking water and electricity. This Chapter presents emerging evidence of the achievements on these fronts. It reviews the progress on the social infrastructure front and the enhancement of employment opportunities in the country. It covers various aspects of  the  social  sector,  including  trends  in  the  Government's  expenditure  on  the  social  sector; the progress on the human development front; multiple measures being taken to ensure basic necessities to all citizens; the trends in employment and education and measures to enhance the quality of life and governance in rural areas. It dwells on various Government initiatives towards attaining different SDGs and the outcomes thereof.",
