The new laws are in tune with the changing labour market trends and, at the same time, accommodate the minimum wage requirement and welfare  needs  of  the  unorganised  sector  workers,  including  the  self-employed  and  migrant workers, within the legislation framework. The Labour Codes have been aligned with the present economic  scenario  and  technological  advancements  along  with  reduction  in  multiplicity  of definitions and authorities. The Codes also ease compliance mechanism aiming to promote ease of doing business/setting up of enterprises and catalyse creation of employment opportunities while ensuring safety, health and social security of every worker. Use of technology, such as, web-based Inspection has been introduced in order to ensure transparency and accountability in enforcement. Decriminalisation of minor offences has also been provided in the Labour Codes.\n\n- 6.18 Rules  made  under  the  Codes  have  been  entrusted  to  Central  Government,  State Government and at appropriate level. There is a requirement for pre-publication of Rules in their official Gazettes for public consultation. As of 13 December 2022, 31 States also have prepublished the draft rules under the Code on Wages, 28 States under Industrial Relations Code, 28 States under Code on Social Security, and 26 States under Occupational Safety Health and Working Conditions Code.\n\ntable Vi.3: Status of rules by States/uts under the four labour codes\n\n| name of code                                                     | name of States which have pre-published the draft rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| The Code on Wages, 2019                                          | Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Sikkim, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, UTs of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, NCT of Delhi and Puducherry (31) |\n| The Industrial Relations Code, 2020                              | Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, UTs of Chandigarh, Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh and Puducherry ( 28)                                                    |\n| The Code on Social Security, 2020                                | Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, UTs of Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Chandigarh, Jammu &Kashmir, Ladakh and Puducherry (28 )                                      |\n| The Occupational Safety Health and working Conditions Code, 2020 | Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Manipur, Odisha, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Tripura, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, UTs of Chandigarh, Jammu &Kashmir, Ladakh and Puducherry (26)                                                                       |\n\nSource: Ministry of Labour &amp; Employment; status as of 13 December 2022\n\n## e-Shram portal\n\n6.19 The Government has been working on improving life and dignity of labour force of country by protecting and safeguarding the interest of workers, promoting their welfare and providing social security both in organised and unorganised sectors.

It is the first-ever national database of unorganised workers, including migrant workers,  construction  workers,  gig  and  platform  workers,  etc.Currently,  e-Shram  portal  has been linked to NCS portal and ASEEM portal for seamless facilitation of services.\n\n6.20 As on 31 December 2022, total over 28.5 crore unorganised workers have been registered on eShram portal. Female registrations stood at 52.8 per cent of the total and 61.7 per cent of\n\ntotal registrations belonged to the age group 18-40 years.
