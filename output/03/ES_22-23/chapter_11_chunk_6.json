See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"India's external sector has faced challenges due to global commodity prices, tightening international financial conditions, and a looming global growth slowdown. However, it has been able to navigate these headwinds due to strong macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers. During FY23, India's exports have shown resilience, with petroleum products, gems & jewelry, organic & inorganic chemicals, drugs & pharmaceuticals being the leading export items. The slowdown in Indian exports is inevitable in a slowing global economy characterized by slowing global trade.\\n\\nTo nurture the inherent comparative advantage that Indian exports embody, various export promotion measures are being considered/implemented. These measures would include the National Logistics Policy, which would ease domestic frictions to encourage Indian exports by reducing the cost of internal logistics. The latest Free Trade Agreements, such as with UAE and Australia, would address external frictions by creating opportunities for exports at concessional tariffs and non-tariff barriers.\\n\\nIndia's balance of payments (BoP) encountered pressures during the year under review, with the Current Account Deficit (CAD) widening due to a sharp rise in oil prices. However, the expected easing of crude oil prices, resilience of net services exports, and buoyant inward remittances would result in a lower CAD during the remainder of FY23. India's external sector has fortified shock absorbers, including forex reserves of $562.72 billion, which can cover 9.3 months of imports, and a sustainable external debt-to-GDP ratio of 19.2%.\\n\\nThe global economy has experienced two major shocks: the 2007-08 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had a contrasting impact on the global economy, with economic growth declining to -3.8% in 2020. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has further amplified the situation, leading to a rise in inflation rates.\\n\\nIndia's trade performance has been resilient, with merchandise exports reaching an all-time high of $422 billion in FY22. However, the growth momentum has moderated in 2022 due to global headwinds. Non-petroleum and non-gems & jewelry exports have sustained their growth momentum, with notable growth in drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronic goods, engineering goods, and organic and inorganic chemicals.\\n\\nIndia's merchandise trade deficit for April-December 2022 was estimated at $218.9 billion. The services sector has been a bright spot, with exports standing at $254.5 billion in FY22, registering a growth of 23.5% over FY21. Software and business services constitute more than 60% of India's total services exports.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports/imports in Indian Rupees (INR) to promote the growth of global trade with emphasis on exports from India. The framework involves invoicing of exports and imports in INR, market-determined exchange rates, and settlement through special Rupee Vostro accounts.\\n\\nIndia's current account balance (CAB) recorded a deficit of $36.4 billion (4.4% of GDP) in Q2FY23. The widening of the CAB was mainly due to a higher merchandise trade deficit and an increase in net investment income outgo. Net services receipts increased from $51.4 billion in H1FY22 to $65.5 billion in H1FY23, primarily due to robust computer and business services receipts.\\n\\nRemittances are the second-largest major source of external financing after service exports, contributing to narrowing the CAD. India has the largest emigrant population and is the top remittance recipient country, with remittances anticipated to reach a milestone of $100 billion in 2022.\\n\\nForeign investment, consisting of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), is the largest component of the capital account. Net FDI inflows at $20.0 billion in H1FY23 were comparable with $20.3 billion in H1FY22. However, FPI flows turned negative in Q1FY23, leading to a net outflow of $14.6 billion.\\n\\nIndia's external debt, at $610.5 billion as of end-September 2022, grew by 1.3% over $602.9 billion as of end-September 2021. However, external debt as a ratio to GDP fell to 19.2% as of end-September 2022 from 20.3% a year ago. India's external debt vulnerability indicators continued to be benign, with external debt as a ratio to GDP at 19.2% and the debt service ratio at 5.0%.\\n\\nThe exchange rate of the Indian Rupee is market-determined, with the RBI intervening mainly to contain excessive volatility. On a financial year basis, the INR depreciated against the US$ by 8.3% from April to December 2022. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) of the US dollar appreciated by 7.8% in the calendar year 2022, while the NEER of India depreciated by 4.8%.\\n\\nThe international investment position (IIP) shows that Indian residents' overseas financial assets at $847.5 billion were lower by $73.0 billion or 7.9% compared to the level as of end-March 2022. India's net IIP position was valued at $389.6 billion as of end-September 2022, increasing by $31.4 billion over the level as of end-March 2022.\\n\\nOverall, India's external sector faces challenges, but it has inbuilt shock absorbers to weather them. The sector is performing relatively better compared to many of its peers, with comfortable import cover and moderate CAD. India's external debt vulnerability indicators are benign by international standards.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# International Investment Position: A Reflection of India's Financial Soundness\n\n## International Investment position: a reflection of India's financial Soundness\n\n11.48  The international investment position (IIP) is a statistical statement that shows at a point in time the value and composition of (a) financial assets of residents of an economy that are claims on non-residents and gold bullion held as reserve assets, and (b) liabilities of residents of an economy to non-residents. The difference between an economy's external financial assets and liabilities is the economy's net IIP, which may be positive or negative. 23 The Net IIP position determines whether a country is a net creditor or debtor nation by measuring the difference in its external assets and liabilities. These statistics serve as an indicator of a country's financial condition and soundness. The Net IIP, along with the BoP transactions, reflects the domestic economy's set of international accounts.\n\n11.49  For India, as of end-September 2022, Indian residents' overseas financial assets at US$ 847.5 billion were lower by US$ 73.0 billion or 7.9 per cent compared to the level as of endMarch 2022, mainly due to the reduction in reserve assets even as trade credit and overseas direct  investment  recorded  an  increase.  Reserve  assets  at  US$  532.7  billion,  accounting  for around 62.9 per cent of India's international financial assets fell by 12.3 per cent over the same period.\n\n11.50  International liabilities at US$ 1,237.1 billion as of end-September 2022 were lower by US$ 41.6 billion (3.2 per cent) as compared to the level as of end-March 2022. This fall was attributed primarily to direct investment (net) outflows, while variations in the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis other currencies also had an impact on the change in liabilities when valued in US$ terms. The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities was 50 per cent as of endSeptember 2022.\n\n11.51  Thus, the net claims of non-residents on India, valued at US$ 389.6 billion as of endSeptember 2022, increased by US$ 31.4 billion over the level as of end-March 2022. India's international financial assets covered 68.5 per cent of international financial liabilities as of endSeptember 2022.\n\nxI.18: India's net International Investment position in end-September 2022\n\na. net IIp and as percentage to Gdp\n\nb. asset liabilities ratio (in per cent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI; P: Provisional\n\n23 IMF, Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition (BPM6),",
