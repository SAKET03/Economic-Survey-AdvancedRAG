However, it has been able to navigate these headwinds due to strong macroeconomic fundamentals and buffers. During FY23, India's exports have shown resilience, with petroleum products, gems & jewelry, organic & inorganic chemicals, drugs & pharmaceuticals being the leading export items. The slowdown in Indian exports is inevitable in a slowing global economy characterized by slowing global trade.\\n\\nTo nurture the inherent comparative advantage that Indian exports embody, various export promotion measures are being considered/implemented. These measures would include the National Logistics Policy, which would ease domestic frictions to encourage Indian exports by reducing the cost of internal logistics. The latest Free Trade Agreements, such as with UAE and Australia, would address external frictions by creating opportunities for exports at concessional tariffs and non-tariff barriers.\\n\\nIndia's balance of payments (BoP) encountered pressures during the year under review, with the Current Account Deficit (CAD) widening due to a sharp rise in oil prices. However, the expected easing of crude oil prices, resilience of net services exports, and buoyant inward remittances would result in a lower CAD during the remainder of FY23. India's external sector has fortified shock absorbers, including forex reserves of $562.72 billion, which can cover 9.3 months of imports, and a sustainable external debt-to-GDP ratio of 19.2%.\\n\\nThe global economy has experienced two major shocks: the 2007-08 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has had a contrasting impact on the global economy, with economic growth declining to -3.8% in 2020. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict has further amplified the situation, leading to a rise in inflation rates.\\n\\nIndia's trade performance has been resilient, with merchandise exports reaching an all-time high of $422 billion in FY22. However, the growth momentum has moderated in 2022 due to global headwinds. Non-petroleum and non-gems & jewelry exports have sustained their growth momentum, with notable growth in drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronic goods, engineering goods, and organic and inorganic chemicals.\\n\\nIndia's merchandise trade deficit for April-December 2022 was estimated at $218.9 billion. The services sector has been a bright spot, with exports standing at $254.5 billion in FY22, registering a growth of 23.5% over FY21. Software and business services constitute more than 60% of India's total services exports.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has permitted invoicing, payment, and settlement of exports/imports in Indian Rupees (INR) to promote the growth of global trade with emphasis on exports from India. The framework involves invoicing of exports and imports in INR, market-determined exchange rates, and settlement through special Rupee Vostro accounts.\\n\\nIndia's current account balance (CAB) recorded a deficit of $36.4 billion (4.4% of GDP) in Q2FY23. The widening of the CAB was mainly due to a higher merchandise trade deficit and an increase in net investment income outgo. Net services receipts increased from $51.4 billion in H1FY22 to $65.5 billion in H1FY23, primarily due to robust computer and business services receipts.\\n\\nRemittances are the second-largest major source of external financing after service exports, contributing to narrowing the CAD. India has the largest emigrant population and is the top remittance recipient country, with remittances anticipated to reach a milestone of $100 billion in 2022.\\n\\nForeign investment, consisting of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI), is the largest component of the capital account. Net FDI inflows at $20.0 billion in H1FY23 were comparable with $20.3 billion in H1FY22. However, FPI flows turned negative in Q1FY23, leading to a net outflow of $14.6 billion.\\n\\nIndia's external debt, at $610.5 billion as of end-September 2022, grew by 1.3% over $602.9 billion as of end-September 2021. However, external debt as a ratio to GDP fell to 19.2% as of end-September 2022 from 20.3% a year ago. India's external debt vulnerability indicators continued to be benign, with external debt as a ratio to GDP at 19.2% and the debt service ratio at 5.0%.\\n\\nThe exchange rate of the Indian Rupee is market-determined, with the RBI intervening mainly to contain excessive volatility. On a financial year basis, the INR depreciated against the US$ by 8.3% from April to December 2022. The Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) of the US dollar appreciated by 7.8% in the calendar year 2022, while the NEER of India depreciated by 4.8%.\\n\\nThe international investment position (IIP) shows that Indian residents' overseas financial assets at $847.5 billion were lower by $73.0 billion or 7.9% compared to the level as of end-March 2022. India's net IIP position was valued at $389.6 billion as of end-September 2022, increasing by $31.4 billion over the level as of end-March 2022.\\n\\nOverall, India's external sector faces challenges, but it has inbuilt shock absorbers to weather them. The sector is performing relatively better compared to many of its peers, with comfortable import cover and moderate CAD. India's external debt vulnerability indicators are benign by international standards.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## Introduction\n\n11.1  Two global shocks in the new millennium - one an economic shock and the other, a health shock - have had very contrasting repercussions on the global economy. Following the global financial crisis in 2007-08 as the inflationary pressures were muted, interest rates were extremely low for long years. The easing financial conditions supported global economic growth, which reached 4.5 per cent in 2010. Now, the Covid-19 pandemic is another shock to global growth performance, with economic growth down to a negative of 3.8 per cent in 2020. The following two years saw inflation rates rise to multi-decade highs, fuelled by global commodity and food price spikes. The situation has been further amplified by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. To stem the situation, monetary authorities in advanced economies, especially the US Federal Reserve (US Fed), are accelerating the pace of monetary policy normalisation. The 10-year Treasury yield in the US increased almost six-fold between mid-2020 and mid-2022. Risk assets were sold off sharply triggering capital flight from many emerging and frontier market economies, bringing to a halt the rebound of net capital flows to developing countries observed since the last quarter of 2020.\n\n11.2  Interest  rates  and  prices  of  risk  assets  have  been  extremely  volatile  since April  2022, reflecting heightened uncertainty about the economic and policy outlook, exacerbated by low liquidity. The US dollar appreciated sharply against currencies of Emerging Market Economies (EMEs) and major advanced economies facing high borrowing costs. Thus, global financial conditions have considerably tightened especially since April 2022, and the balance of risks is significantly skewed to the downside, thereby weakening the global economic outlook. Global growth is forecast to slow from 6.0 per cent in 2021 to 3.2 per cent in 2022 and 2.7 per cent in 2023 according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 1 This is the weakest growth profile since 2001 except for the global financial crisis and the acute phase of the pandemic. Further, external public debt vulnerability concerns are being exacerbated as such debt in developing economies is at record levels presently and most of it is owed to private creditors, with much of it involving variable interest rates that could spike suddenly. 2 Thus, emerging markets face a host of risks emanating from elevated external borrowing costs, sticky high inflation, volatile commodity markets, uncertain global economic growth outlook, and spill overs from policy tightening in advanced economies.\n\n1 World Economic Outlook Report, IMF, October 2022.\n\n2 'South Asia's Current Macroeconomic Challenges and Policy Priorities', Keynote Address by Shri Shaktikanta Das, Governor, Reserve Bank of India -6 January  2023 - at the high-level Conference co-organised by IMF Asia and Pacific Department and IMF South Asia Regional Training and Technical Assistance Centre, New Delhi\n\n11.3  Against this fast-evolving global backdrop, this chapter chronicles the developments in the external sector of the Indian economy focusing on exports, imports, international investment, foreign exchange reserves, movement of the currency against the US dollar, external debt, and the BoP situation. Where available, a comparison of some of these indicators with some peer countries is also made to present India's external sector situation in a proper perspective.",
