See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Indian industry sector contributes about 30% of the country's total gross value added (GVA) and has shown resilience in the face of global headwinds. In FY23, the industry faced challenges due to the Russian-Ukraine conflict, which led to a sharp rise in commodity prices. Despite this, the sector showed a modest growth of 4.1% in FY23, compared to 10.3% in FY22. The growth in industrial income has kept pace with overall GVA growth, with manufacturing GVA growing at a higher rate.\\n\\nThe industry sector provides employment to over 12.1 crore people and has direct and indirect linkages with other sectors, contributing to economic growth and employment. Industrial growth has multiplier effects, leading to employment growth, and some industries like textiles and construction have high employment elasticities.\\n\\nThe survey reviews the performance of the Indian industry in FY23, exploring demand stimulants to industrial growth, supply response, trends in credit to the industry, and foreign investment. The chapter also addresses developments in key sub-industries and their challenges.\\n\\nThe industry sector's growth is driven by robust domestic conditions, strong export performance, and increased investment demand. Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23 was the highest since FY15. Exports of goods and services as a share of GDP have been the highest since FY16.\\n\\nThe increase in investment demand has emerged as a powerful stimulus to industrial growth, triggered by the augmented capex of the central government. The growth of eight core industries, including coal, fertilizers, cement, electricity, steel, and refinery products, has held steady, reflecting a broad momentum in industrial activity.\\n\\nThe electronics industry continues to ascend in importance, with India becoming the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer globally. The Indian pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticals industry, ranking 3rd worldwide in production by volume and 14th by value.\\n\\nThe government's Make-in-India initiative has facilitated investment, fostered innovation, and built world-class infrastructure. The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes across 14 categories have further complemented it, with an estimated Capex of around ₹3 lakh crore over the next five years and the potential to generate over 60 lakh jobs.\\n\\nThe industry sector's growth has been supported by an upswing in bank credit, with credit to industry growing in double digits since July 2022. Credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase, assisted by the introduction of the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS).\\n\\nThe survey highlights the importance of the industry sector in the Indian economy and its potential to become a global manufacturing hub. The sector's growth is expected to be driven by strong domestic demand, investment revival, and export growth. However, the sector also faces challenges, including input cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and global economic uncertainty.\\n\\nThe government has implemented several measures to support the industry sector, including the PLI schemes, the Make-in-India initiative, and the ECLGS. The sector is expected to play a critical role in India's economic growth and its ambitions to become a key player in global value chains.\\n\\nThe Indian economy has made significant strides in internet penetration, which is a key requisite of Industry 4.0. The government is cognizant of the importance of Industry 4.0 in achieving the goals of Aatmanirbharta and its ambitions of becoming a key player in global value chains.\\n\\nThe Global Innovation Index (GII) ranks countries based on innovation performance, and India entered the top 40 innovating countries for the first time in 2022. India became the most innovative nation in the lower-middle-income group, overtaking Vietnam and leading the Central and Southern Asia region.\\n\\nThe 'Make in India' initiative has been striving to ensure that the business ecosystem in the nation is conducive for investors doing business in India. The reform measures include amendments to laws and liberalization of guidelines and regulations to reduce compliance burdens.\\n\\nThe DPIIT's Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) 2020 shows that 7,496 reforms were implemented across States and UTs, enhancing the Ease of Doing Business. Ministries and States/UTs have reduced more than 39,000 compliances, and over 3,500 provisions related to minor technical or procedural defaults have been decriminalized.\\n\\nThe National Single Window System (NSWS) was soft-launched in September 2021 to improve the ease of doing business by providing a single digital platform to investors for approvals and clearances. The portal has integrated multiple existing clearance systems of various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments.\\n\\nThe government's efforts towards fostering innovation include incubation, handholding, funding, industry-academia partnership, and mentorship. The government has strengthened its IPR regime by modernizing the IP office, reducing legal compliances, and facilitating IP filing for start-ups, women entrepreneurs, small industries, and others.\\n\\nThe start-up ecosystem in India has grown significantly, with over 48% of start-ups from Tier II & III cities. The government has given a major boost to start-ups through various initiatives, including the Start-up India Initiative, eligible companies getting recognized as Start-ups by DPIIT to access tax benefits, easier compliance, and IPR fast-tracking.\\n\\nThe 'Flipping' phenomenon, where Indian start-ups get headquartered overseas, has been observed, but the government has taken measures to encourage 'Reverse Flipping'. The measures include simplifying the process for grant of 'Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB) certification' for Start-ups, further simplification of taxation of Employee Stock Options (ESOPs), and simplifying multiple layers of tax and uncertainty due to tax litigation.\\n\\nOverall, the Indian industry sector has shown resilience and growth, driven by strong domestic demand, investment revival, and export growth. The sector is expected to play a critical role in India's economic growth and its ambitions to become a key player in global value chains.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 8 Content:\n# India's Prospects as a Key Player in the Global Value Chain\n\n## India's Prospects as a Key Player in the Global value chain\n\n9.42 The risk of supply chain shocks has never been more palpable than today, following compounding crises from the US-China trade war, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the war in Ukraine. In this fast-evolving context, as global companies adapt their manufacturing and supply chain strategies to build resilience, India has a unique opportunity to become a global manufacturing hub  this  decade.  The  three  primary  assets  to  capitalise  on  this  unique  opportunity  are  the potential for significant domestic demand, the Government's drive to encourage manufacturing, and a distinct demographic edge, including a considerable proportion of the young workforce. The manufacturing sector in India is gradually shifting to more automated and process-driven manufacturing, which is expected to increase efficiency and boost the production of the industry. The 'Make-in-India' Initiative was launched in 2014 to make India a hub for manufacturing, design, and innovation. Since then, it has facilitated investment, fostered innovation and built world-class  infrastructure.  The  progress  made  in  infrastructure  development  is  discussed  in chapter 12 \" Physical and Digital Infrasturcture: lifting potential growth \".\n\n## Make in India 2.0 and the PLI schemes\n\n9.43 To further enhance India's integration in the global value chain, 'Make in India 2.0' is now\n\nfocusing on 27 sectors, which include 15 manufacturing sectors and 12 service sectors. Amongst these, 24 sub-sectors have been chosen while keeping in mind the Indian industries' strengths and competitive edge, the need for import substitution, the  potential  for  export  and  increased  employability. Efforts are on to boost the growth of the sub-sectors in a holistic and coordinated manner.\n\nFigure IX.27: 24 Sub-Sectors under Make in India 2.0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: DPIIT\n\n9.44 In pursuit of the objectives of the Make-in-India programme and with a vision to achieve Aatmanirbharta, the government launched the PLI scheme. The scheme is expected to attract a capex of approximately ₹3 lakh crore over the next five years. It has the potential to generate employment for over 60 lakh in India and increase the share of the manufacturing sector in total capital formation, which currently stands at around 17-20 per cent between FY12 and FY20. It is further believed that there will be a significant reduction in the trade deficit with domestic production substituting for imports. Sectors under which the PLI scheme has been announced currently constitute around 40 per cent of the total imports. The scheme, spread across 14 sectors, can enhance India's annual manufacturing capex by 15 to 20 per cent from FY23.\n\n9.45 PLI Scheme across these key specific sectors is poised to make Indian manufacturers globally  competitive,  attract  investment  in  the  areas  of  core  competency  and  cutting-edge technology; ensure efficiencies; create economies of scale; and make India an integral part of the global value chain. The scheme will benefit the MSME ecosystem in the country. The anchor units built in every sector will require a new supplier base in the entire value chain. Most of these ancillary units will be built in the MSME sector.\n\n9.46 As  of  31 st December  2022,  717  applications  have  been  approved  under  14  Schemes. More than 100 MSMEs are among the PLI beneficiaries in sectors such as Bulk Drugs, Medical Devices, Telecom, White Goods and Food Processing. As per recent reporting from implementing Ministries/  Departments,  around  ₹47,500  crore  (US$  6  billion)  of  actual  investment  has  been made; production/ sales of ₹3.85 lakh crore (US$ 47 billion) of eligible products and employment\n\ngeneration of around 3 lakh has been reported and 106 per cent achievement of actual investment reported  versus  the  corresponding  projections  of  FY22 7 .  Key  sectors  such  as  Large-Scale Electronics Manufacturing, Pharmaceuticals, Telecom &amp; Networking Products, Food Processing and White Goods have contributed considerably to investment, production, sales and employment.\n\n9.47 Some of the latest developments under the PLI programme include the launch of a designled PLI in June 2022 to promote the entire value chain in telecom manufacturing and to build a strong ecosystem for 5G as part of the PLI Scheme for Telecom &amp; Networking products. Approvals under this Scheme have already been granted to eligible companies. In September 2022, the Cabinet recently approved PLI Scheme (Tranche II) on 'National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar PV Modules', with an outlay of ₹19,500 crore to build an ecosystem for manufacturing of high-efficiency solar PV modules in India, thus reducing import dependence in the area of renewable energy.\n\n## Box IX.4: Shipbuilding Sector: achieving Self-Reliance and promoting Make in India\n\nThe Shipbuilding industry is a strategically important industry due to its role in energy security, national defence and the development of the heavy engineering industry. It has the potential to increase the contribution of the industry and the services sector to the national GDP. With its immense direct and indirect linkages with most other leading industries, such as steel, aluminum, electrical machinery and equipment etc., and its huge dependence on infrastructure and services sectors of the economy, the shipbuilding  industry  has  the  potential  to  strengthen  the  mission  of  an  'Aatmanirbhar'  Bharat. The Indian Navy (IN) shipbuilding projects currently in progress at various Indian shipyards are poised to provide the requisite impetus to the industry. With the objective to achieve strategic independence in shipbuilding and development of niche technology, as of date, more than 130 IN warships have been constructed at Indian shipyards, and presently, 41 of 43 ships and submarines are being constructed at various public and private sector Indian shipyards. These initiatives, through various channels, are contributing to economic growth and employment in the country.\n\n## Boost to ancillary Industry\n\nShipbuilding  with  its  links  to  other  ancillary  industries,  including  steel,  engineering  equipment, port infrastructure, trade and shipping services has the potential to create a collaborative production eco-system. With the development of these ancillary industries, the sector generates opportunities for  smaller  businesses  and  strengthens  supply  chain  networks.  It  is  noteworthy  that  a  significant proportion of value addition, approximately 65 per cent, in the construction of a ship is derived from manufacturers of shipboard materials, equipment, and systems.\n\n## Significant Investment and employment Generation Multiplier effects\n\nBased on International shipbuilding statistics, if one takes a conservative Marginal Consumption to GDP Ratio (MCGR) of 0.45 for the shipbuilding sector, the investment multiplier would be approx. around 1.82. For example, an injection of approx. ₹1.5 lakh crore in naval shipbuilding projects would accrue a circulation of ₹2.73 lakh crore in the shipbuilding sector due to the multiplier effect.\n\nAmong  manufacturing  activities,  shipbuilding  has  one  of  the  highest  employment  multipliers of  6.4 8 .  It  is  capable  of  generating  mass  employment  in  remote,  coastal  and  rural  areas,  thereby\n\n7 https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetailm.aspx?PRID=1884181\n\n8 https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1593424\n\nabsorbing the labour migrating from agricultural pursuits to manufacturing facilities  established  by shipyards  and  their  ancillary  industries.  The  Indigenisation  initiatives  implemented  by  the  IN  have resulted in a significant infusion of economic activity by creating employment opportunities for MSMEs and other industries. For instance, the recently commissioned INS Vikrant alone engaged approximately 500 MSMEs, 12,000 employees from ancillary industries, and 2,000 shipyard employees.\n\nFurther, a study undertaken by the IN for the construction of seven P17A ships reveals that around three-fourths of the total project cost of warships is invested back into the Indian economy. This investment  is  ploughed  back  into  the  economy  through  indigenous  sourcing  of  raw  materials, development of equipment and systems installed onboard ships and other manpower services.\n\nBesides  benefiting  the  ancillary  industries  and  creating  massive  employment  opportunities,  an indigenous shipping and shipbuilding industry can also reduce freight bills and forex outgo, thereby reducing the current account deficit.\n\nThus,  we  see  that  the  strong  forward  and  backward  linkages  of  the  shipbuilding  sector  play  an important part in the creation of a self-relient India.\n\n## Fostering Innovation\n\n9.48 The government's efforts towards fostering innovation include incubation, handholding, funding, industry-academia partnership and mentorship. The government has also strengthened its  IPR  regime  by  modernising  the  IP  office,  reducing  legal  compliances  and  facilitating  IP filing for start-ups, women entrepreneurs, small industries and others. This has resulted in a 46 per cent growth in the domestic filing of patents over 2016-2021, signalling India's transition towards a knowledge-based economy.\n\n9.49 These measures have begun to pay dividends. The Global Innovation Index (GII) ranks the  countries  based  on  innovation  performance,  comprising  around  80  indicators,  including measures on the political environment, education, infrastructure and knowledge creation of each economy. As per the GII 2022 report, India entered the top 40 innovating countries for the first time in 2022 since the inception of the GII in 2007 by improving its rank from 81 in 2015 to 40 in 2022. Further, India became the most innovative nation in the lower middle-income group overtaking Vietnam (48 th ) and leading the Central and Southern Asia region.\n\n## Box XI.5: 'Flipping and Reverse Flipping: the recent developments in Start-ups'\n\nIndia ranks amongst the largest startup ecosystems in the world. An impressive 9 lakh+ direct jobs have been created by the DPIIT recognised startups (self-reported), with a notable 64 per cent increase in 2022 over the average number of new jobs created in the last three years. About 48 per cent of our startups are from Tier II &amp; III cities, a testimony of our grassroots' tremendous potential.\n\nVarious targeted initiatives of the Government have given a major boost to start-ups. For instance, under the Start-up India Initiative , eligible companies get recognised as Start-ups by DPIIT to access a host of tax benefits, easier compliance, and IPR (Intellectual Property Rights) fast-tracking. As part of the umbrella schemes of the National Initiative for Developing and Harnessing Innovations (NIDHI) and atal Innovation Mission (aIM) , entrepreneurship and innovation are fostered across the start-up ecosystem in the country. The Fund of Funds for Start-ups (FFS) and Credit Guarantee\n\nScheme  for  Start-ups  (CGSS)  support  seed  funding  and  successive  credit  needs.  The  R&amp;D platform  for  technology  sectors  is  offered  by  schemes  such  as  MeitY  Start-up  Hub  (MSH)  and Technology  Incubation  and  Development  of  entrepreneurs  (TIDe  2.0) , among  others. Engaging  Indian  start-ups  with  global  peers  is  another  essential  pillar  of  Start-up  India  and  is facilitated through Government-to-Government partnerships, participation in international forums, and hosting of global events. Further, the Support for International Patent Protection in e&amp;IT (SIP-eIT) Scheme  encourages  international  patent  filing  by  Indian  MSMEs  and  start-ups 9 .\n\nFigure a: Jobs created by Start-ups\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: Data as on 17 th  January 2023\n\nWhile  external  support  from  the  government  has  made  it  relatively  easier  than  before  for entrepreneurship to thrive, there are several inherent challenges faced by start-ups. Be it ever-elusive funding, revenue generation struggles, lack of easy access to supportive infrastructure, or wading through the regulatory environment and tax structures. It has also been observed that many Indian companies have been getting headquartered overseas, especially in destinations with favourable legal environments and taxation policies. The technical jargon for this may be identified as ' Flipping' , which is the process of transferring the entire ownership of an Indian company to an overseas entity, accompanied by a transfer of all IP and all data hitherto owned by the Indian company. It effectively transforms an Indian company into a 100 per cent subsidiary of a foreign entity, with the founders and investors retaining the same ownership via the foreign entity, having swapped all shares.\n\nTypically, 'Flipping' happens at the early stage of the Start-ups, driven by commercial, taxation and personal preferences of founders and investors. Some companies decide to 'Flip' because the major market of their product is offshore. Sometimes, investor preferences like access to incubators drive the companies to 'Flip' as they insist on a particular domicile. Some companies prefer to domicile in countries where they would like to access Capital Market later for better valuations and ticket size. Better protection and enforcement of IP and tax treatment of Licensing revenue from IP, residential status of Founders, and agile corporate structures have been the reasons for 'Flipping' in the Past.\n\nIn popular holding company jurisdictions like Singapore ,  dividends received from a Singaporean company/subsidiary  are  not  taxed  at  the  holding  level.  There  are  no  withholding  taxes  when\n\n9 Source: PIB https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1884256, https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx -\n\n?PRID=1884069#:~:text=PLI%20Scheme%20extends%20an%20incentive,2020\n\ndistributing dividends to residents or non-resident shareholders. This is a critical component since the dividend is one of the most popular repatriation tools. There are no withholding taxes in the United Arab Emirates ( Uae) under current legislation. These jurisdictions have tailor-made their policies and tax and incentive structures to incentivise companies to store IPs and create Holding companies as Regional Headquarters. European jurisdictions, such as the Netherlands , provide for participation exemptions on dividends and capital gains (based on certain shareholding thresholds, i.e., 5 per cent and other tests). These exemptions are currently unavailable in India, and any migration of existing structures to India triggers capital gains tax. However, of late, with relatively easy access to Capital through  a  vibrant  Private  Equity/Venture  Capital  Ecosystem,  changes  in  rules  regarding  roundtripping, and the growing maturity of India's capital markets have not only slowed down the Flipping, but companies are also exploring 'Reverse Flipping'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure B: effect of Flipping on the structure of the company Pre-Flipping Post-Flipping\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo accelerate 'Reverse Flipping', certain measures are possible, some of which are listed below:\n\n- i. Simplifying the process for grant of 'Inter-Ministerial Board (IMB) certification' for Start-ups\n- ii. Further simplification of taxation of Employee Stock Options (ESOPs)\n- iii. Simplifying multiple layers of tax and uncertainty due to tax litigation\n- iv. Simplifying procedures for capital flows: Many countries, such as US and Singapore, have easier corporate laws, with lesser restrictions on the inflow and outflow of capital and treatment of Hybrid Securities\n- v. Facilitating improved collaboration and partnerships with established private entities to develop best practices and state-of-the-art start-up mentorship platforms\n- vi. Exploring  the  incubation  and  funding  landscape  for  start-ups  in  emerging  fields  like  social innovation and impact investment.\n\nThe flipping phenomenon mentioned above reflects start-ups venturing out for short-term gains in the dynamic, uncertain geopolitical world. However, the flip can be reversed with the collective action by the Government related regulatory bodies and other stakeholders. With solution-oriented strategies, start-ups will continue to be the messengers of India's entrepreneurial dynamism.\n\n## Structural reforms have enhanced the Ease of Doing Business\n\n- 9.50 The 'Make in India' initiative has been striving to ensure that the business ecosystem in the nation is conducive for investors doing business in India and contributing to the growth and development of the Nation. This has been done through various reforms that have led to increased investment inflows and economic growth. The reform measures include amendments to laws and liberalisation of guidelines and regulations to reduce compliance burdens, bring down costs and enhance the ease of doing business in India. Burdensome compliances with rules and regulations  have  been  reduced  through  simplification,  rationalisation,  decriminalisation, and digitisation. Steps to promote manufacturing and investments include reduction in corporate taxes, public procurement and Phased Manufacturing Programme.\n- 9.51 The  DPIIT's  Business  Reform  Action  Plan  (BRAP)  2020  (fifth  edition),  based  on the implementation of reforms by States/UTs, was released on 30 th  June 2022. It shows that 7,496 reforms were implemented across States and UTs as part of the BRAP 2020 assessment, thereby significantly enhancing the Ease of Doing Business across the country. Reducing the Compliance Burden (RCB) on businesses and citizens is a continuous exercise to leapfrog to the next level of governance excellence and improve Ease of Living. Ministries and States/UTs have reduced more than 39,000 compliances (as on 17 th January 2023). Specifically, more than 3,500 provisions related to minor technical or procedural defaults have been decriminalised by Ministries and States/UTs based on details uploaded on DPIIT's Regulatory Compliance Portal as on 17 th  January 2023. Further, the NSWS was soft-launched in September 2021 to improve the  ease  of  doing  business  by  providing  a  single  digital  platform  to  investors  for  approvals and clearances. The portal  is  rapidly  gaining  traction  amongst  the  investor  community  and, as of 10 th January 2023, has about 4.3 lakh plus unique visitors. 81,000+ approvals have been facilitated through NSWS, and 43,000+ approvals are currently under process. The portal will progressively onboard more approvals and licenses based on user /industry feedback. This portal has integrated multiple existing clearance systems of the various Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and State Governments to enhance investor experience.\n\n## India and Industry 4.0\n\n- 9.52 The advent of the fourth industrial revolution or industry 4.0 as it's commonly referred to,  has  begun.  The  transformation  integrates  new  technologies  such  as  cloud  computing, IoT,  machine  learning,  and  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  into  manufacturing  processes,  leading to efficiencies across the value chain. While the adoption of these technologies in the Indian manufacturing sector is underway, large-scale adoption is yet to happen. However, an enabling environment is rapidly developing. In recent years, India has made significant strides in internet penetration which is one of the key requisites of industry 4.0. The push towards self-reliance in semiconductor technology and production will help India erect another pillar of this revolution - hyper-efficient processing technology.\n- 9.53 The government is cognisant of the importance of industry 4.0 in achieving the goals of Aatmanirbharta and its ambitions of becoming a key player in global value chains. A few initiatives  by  the  government  include  the  SAMARTH  (Smart Advanced  Manufacturing  and Rapid Transformation Hubs) Udyog Bharat 4.0 under the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises, which aims to encourage technological solutions to Indian manufacturing\n\nunits through awareness programmes and demonstrations. Another initiative is the establishment of the Centre for Fourth Industrial Revolution in India in 2018, which looks to develop policy frameworks for emerging technologies.",
