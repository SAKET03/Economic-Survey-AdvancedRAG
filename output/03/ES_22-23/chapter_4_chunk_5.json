  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nThe year 2022 marked the return of high inflation, especially in advanced economies, after nearly four decades. Inflation did not spare emerging economies either. Major central banks implemented sharp increases in policy rates, with the Federal Reserve's rate hikes being the steepest since the 1970s. The RBI initiated its monetary tightening cycle in April 2022 and has since implemented a policy repo rate hike of 225 basis points. Consequently, domestic financial conditions began to tighten, reflected in the lower growth of monetary aggregates. The change in RBI's policy stance in FY23 led to a moderation of surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed during the pandemic years. Monetary policy transmission is well underway as lending and deposit rates increased following the hike in policy rates. In the government securities (G-sec) market, bond yields were on an upward trajectory until June 2022 and moderated in November and December 2022. The global tightening cycle contributed to a dampened global outlook, but the domestic appetite for credit has been on an upswing. Non-food credit offtake by scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) has been growing in double digits since April 2022. Credit disbursed by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) has also been on the rise. The balance sheet clean-up exercise has been vital in enhancing the lending ability of financial institutions. The Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.0%, while the Capital-to-Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) remains healthy at 16.0%. The health of NBFCs has continued to improve as well. Political and economic developments in 2022 led to increased volatility in capital markets around the world. However, domestic capital markets displayed some encouraging trends. The primary equity markets witnessed participation from all segments, especially with increased Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contributions. The secondary capital market indices performed better than their peers between April and December 2022. Net FPI flows turned positive in the quarter ending December 2022. The indices have displayed a decreasing trend in volatility as measured by the India Volatility Index (VIX) over this period. Insurance penetration in India has been steadily increasing, with life insurance penetration being above the emerging markets and global averages. India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. The pension sector has also been taking rapid strides since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The sector has witnessed a robust increase in the number of subscribers and assets under management (AuM). As global central banks reaffirm their hawkish stances and telegraph 'higher-for-longer' policy rates, monetary conditions are expected to remain tight worldwide. Domestically, RBI's support to growth will ensure adequate liquidity in financial markets. The growth in credit offtake is expected to sustain, and combined with a pick-up in private Capex, will usher in a virtuous investment cycle.\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Banking Sector\n\n## Banking Sector\n\n## Resilient and well-capitalised Banking System\n\n4.14  Since the middle of the previous decade, RBI and the government have made dedicated efforts in terms of calibrated policy measures like strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework, implementation of 4R's approach of Recognition, Resolution, Recapitalisation and Reforms to clean and strengthen the balance sheet of the banking system. These continuous efforts over the years have culminated in the enhancement of risk absorption capacity and a healthier  banking  system  balance  sheet  both  in  terms  of  asset  quantity  and  quality  over  the years.\n\nBanking System: Improvement in Asset quality and strengthening of balance sheet\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI\n\nNote: SCBs stand for Scheduled Commercial Banks, PSBs stand for Public Sector Banks, PVBs stand for Private Sector Banks, FBs stands for Foreign Banks\n\n4.15  Consequently, the asset quality of SCBs has been improving steadily over the years across all major sectors. The GNPA ratio has decreased from 8.2 per cent in March 2020 to a sevenyear low of 5.0 per cent in September 2022, while Net Non-Performing Assets (NNPA) have dropped to a ten-year low of 1.3 per cent of total assets. Lower slippages and the reduction in outstanding GNPAs through recoveries, upgrades and write-offs led to this decrease. Lower GNPAs, combined with high provisions accumulated in recent years, contributed to a decline in NNPA.  There was a broad-based improvement in the GNPA ratio in the industrial sector, though it remained elevated for gems and jewellery and construction sub-sectors. Going ahead, as per the baseline scenario of the RBI's stress testing framework, the declining tendency in the GNPA ratio is likely to continue and is projected to drop further to 4.9 per cent in March 2023.\n\nfigure iV.7: Broad-based improvement in the gnPa ratio\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI\n\nNote: Numbers in brackets with the legend represents share of the respective sector's GNPA in total GNPA of SCBs as of Sept 2022.\n\n4.16  Moreover,  with  shrinking  GNPAs,  the  Provisioning  Coverage  Ratio  (PCR)  has  been increasing steadily since March 2021 and reached 71.6 per cent in September 2022. The CRAR of  SCBs  has  been  rising  sequentially  in  the  post-asset  quality  review  period.  With  a  pickup in lending activity during H1:FY23, CRAR moderated in September 2022 because of an increase in risk-weighted assets (RWAs). However, it remains well above the minimum capital requirement, including Capital Conservation Buffer (CCB) requirements of 11.5 per cent.\n\nfigure iV.8: capital adequacy ratio well above the requirement norms\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI\n\n4.17  During  the  first  half  of  FY23,  the  profitability  of  SCBs,  measured  in  terms  of  Return on Equity (ROE) and Return on Assets (ROA), improved to levels last observed in FY15. At the system level, Profit After Tax (PAT) witnessed a double-digit growth of 40.7 per cent in the quarter ending September 2022, led by strong growth in Net Interest Income (NII) and a significant lowering of provisions. Macro-stress tests conducted by RBI for credit risk reveal that SCBs are well-capitalised and that all banks would be able to comply with the minimum capital requirements even under adverse stress scenarios.\n\nconsistent improvement in Performance indicators\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI",
