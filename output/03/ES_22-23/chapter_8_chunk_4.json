In 2021-22, the sector grew by 3.0% compared to 3.3% in 2020-21. India has emerged as a net exporter of agricultural products, with exports reaching an all-time high of $50.2 billion in 2021-22. The government has taken measures to promote farmer-producer organizations, encourage crop diversification, and improve productivity in agriculture through support for mechanization and the creation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme has provided income support to farmers, leading to diversification in sources of farmers' income and improving their resilience to weather shocks. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) has been implemented to provide food security, with 81.4 crore beneficiaries receiving free foodgrains for one year from January 1, 2023. The government has also taken initiatives to enhance credit availability, facilitate mechanization, and boost horticulture and organic farming. The animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries sectors have been recognized as emerging sectors, with the government providing support for their development. The chapter discusses various policy initiatives, including the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure returns over the cost of production, and the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) to provide short-term credit to farmers at subsidized interest rates. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) has been introduced to provide hassle-free credit availability to farmers, with 3.89 crore KCCs issued as of December 30, 2022. The government has also promoted organic farming, with 44.3 lakh organic farmers and 59.1 lakh hectares of area brought under organic farming by 2021-22. The chapter highlights the importance of the agriculture sector in India's growth and development, with a focus on sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Enhanced Access to Agricultural Credit\n\n## enhanced Access to Agricultural credit\n\n8.5 Ensuring hassle-free credit availability at a cheaper rate to farmers has been the top priority of the Government of India. Accordingly, the Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) was introduced in 1998 for farmers to empower them to purchase agricultural products and services on credit at any time. As of 30 December, 2022, banks issued Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) to 3.89 crore eligible farmers with a KCC limit of ₹4,51,672 crore. With the Government of India extending the KCC facility to fisheries and animal husbandry farmers in 2018-19, the number of such cards in the fisheries and animal husbandry sector has also grown. As of 17 October 2022, 1.0 lakh KCCs have been sanctioned for the fisheries sector and 9.5 lakh (as of 4 November 2022) for the animal husbandry sector.\n\n8.6 To ensure that the farmers pay a minimal interest rate to the banks, the Government of India  has  introduced  the  Interest  Subvention  Scheme  (ISS),  now  renamed Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS), to provide short-term credit to farmers at subsidised interest rates. Under this scheme, short-term agriculture loan up to ₹3 lakh is available at 7 per cent per annum to  farmers  engaged  in Agriculture  and  other Allied  activities,  including Animal  Husbandry,\n\nDairying,  Poultry,  Fisheries  etc.  An  additional  3  per  cent  subvention  (Prompt  Repayment Incentive) is also given to the farmers for prompt and timely repayment of loans. Therefore, if a farmer repays his loan on time, he gets credit at 4 per cent per annum.\n\n8.7 As a result of the initiatives taken and the measures to strengthen existing policies, there has been a consistent increase in the agriculture credit flow over the years, exceeding the target every year for the past several years. In 2021-22 also, it was about 13 per cent more than the target of ₹16.5 lakh crore. The target for the flow of credit to agriculture for 2022-23 has been fixed at ₹18.5 lakh crore.\n\nFigure VIII.6: Continued Increase in Institutional Credit to Agriculture Sector (₹ lakh crore)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Based on data from DAFW and Agricultural Statistics at a Glance 2021.",
