  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nThe year 2022 marked the return of high inflation, especially in advanced economies, after nearly four decades. Inflation did not spare emerging economies either. Major central banks implemented sharp increases in policy rates, with the Federal Reserve's rate hikes being the steepest since the 1970s. The RBI initiated its monetary tightening cycle in April 2022 and has since implemented a policy repo rate hike of 225 basis points. Consequently, domestic financial conditions began to tighten, reflected in the lower growth of monetary aggregates. The change in RBI's policy stance in FY23 led to a moderation of surplus liquidity conditions that prevailed during the pandemic years. Monetary policy transmission is well underway as lending and deposit rates increased following the hike in policy rates. In the government securities (G-sec) market, bond yields were on an upward trajectory until June 2022 and moderated in November and December 2022. The global tightening cycle contributed to a dampened global outlook, but the domestic appetite for credit has been on an upswing. Non-food credit offtake by scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) has been growing in double digits since April 2022. Credit disbursed by Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) has also been on the rise. The balance sheet clean-up exercise has been vital in enhancing the lending ability of financial institutions. The Gross Non-Performing Assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs has fallen to a seven-year low of 5.0%, while the Capital-to-Risk Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) remains healthy at 16.0%. The health of NBFCs has continued to improve as well. Political and economic developments in 2022 led to increased volatility in capital markets around the world. However, domestic capital markets displayed some encouraging trends. The primary equity markets witnessed participation from all segments, especially with increased Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) contributions. The secondary capital market indices performed better than their peers between April and December 2022. Net FPI flows turned positive in the quarter ending December 2022. The indices have displayed a decreasing trend in volatility as measured by the India Volatility Index (VIX) over this period. Insurance penetration in India has been steadily increasing, with life insurance penetration being above the emerging markets and global averages. India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets in the coming decade. The pension sector has also been taking rapid strides since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The sector has witnessed a robust increase in the number of subscribers and assets under management (AuM). As global central banks reaffirm their hawkish stances and telegraph 'higher-for-longer' policy rates, monetary conditions are expected to remain tight worldwide. Domestically, RBI's support to growth will ensure adequate liquidity in financial markets. The growth in credit offtake is expected to sustain, and combined with a pick-up in private Capex, will usher in a virtuous investment cycle.\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Developments in the G-sec Market\n\n## Developments in the G-sec Market\n\n4.11  After remaining steady through 2020 and 2021, the yield on the 10-year government bond rose in 2022. The weighted average yield spike reflects the domestic bond market volatility stemming from uncertainty in crude prices, a hawkish stance of major central banks, a hardening of global bond yield and the pressure on the rupee. The monthly average yield on the 10-year government bond stood at 7.3 per cent in December 2022 after having peaked at 7.5 per cent in June 2022. Yields moderated in November and December 2022 following smaller rate hikes by major central banks and declining inflation. With the softening of yields, volatility also declined in the second half of 2022.\n\nfigure iV.5: g-sec yields easing since July, with decline in oil prices and global bonds yields\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: FBIL\n\n4.12  The trading volume in G-Secs (including T-Bills and SDLs) reached a two-year high of â‚¹27.7 lakh crore during Q2 FY23, registering a YoY growth of 6.3 per cent. The higher trading volume  reflects  the  growing  interest  of  market  players/  traders  in  the  government  security market.\n\n4.13  Private Sector Banks emerged as the dominant trading segment in the secondary market during the quarter under review, with a share of 25.0 per cent in 'Buy' deals and 24.8 per cent in 'Sell' deals in the total outright trading activity, followed by foreign banks, public sector banks, primary dealers and mutual fund. On a net basis, foreign banks and primary dealers were net sellers. In contrast, public sector banks, cooperative banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, mutual funds, private sector banks and 'others' were net buyers in the secondary market.\n\ntable iV.3: category-wise Share (Per cent) of total outright trading activity in g-Secs*\n\n| category               | July - Sept 2021   | July - Sept 2021   | apr-Jun 2022   | apr-Jun 2022   | July-Sept 2022   | July-Sept 2022   |\n|------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|------------------|\n| category               | Buy                | Sell               | Buy            | Sell           | Buy              | Sell             |\n| Private Sector Banks   | 25.6               | 28.4               | 24.3           | 23.8           | 25               | 24.9             |\n| Foreign Banks          | 18.6               | 19.3               | 20.5           | 22.7           | 21.7             | 22.1             |\n| Public Sector Banks    | 16.6               | 15.6               | 17.3           | 16.4           | 15.7             | 14               |\n| Primary Dealers        | 12.3               | 17.7               | 13.9           | 20.3           | 13.9             | 19.5             |\n| Mutual Funds           | 14.8               | 10.1               | 12.7           | 8.5            | 11.2             | 8.9              |\n| Others                 | 5.1                | 3.6                | 4.1            | 3.3            | 5.3              | 5                |\n| Co-operative Banks     | 2.9                | 2.9                | 3.1            | 2.8            | 3.5              | 3.3              |\n| Insurance Companies    | 3.2                | 2.1                | 3.4            | 2.2            | 3.1              | 2.4              |\n| Financial Institutions | 1                  | 0.4                | 0.6            | 0              | 0.5              | 0                |\n| Total                  | 100                | 100                | 100            | 100            | 100              | 100              |\n\nSource: Dept. of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance\n\nNote: *: Includes T-Bills and SDLs.",
