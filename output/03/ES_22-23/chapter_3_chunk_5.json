See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Union Budget for FY23 was presented in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, with the government adopting a fiscal policy response to the crisis comprising increased food and fertilizer subsidies and reduced taxes on fuel and imported products. Despite additional fiscal pressures, the Union Government is on track to achieve the budget estimate for the fiscal deficit in FY23. The Gross Tax Revenue registered a YoY growth of 15.5% from April to November 2022, driven by robust growth in direct taxes and Goods and Services Tax (GST). The growth in direct taxes during the first eight months of the year was much higher than their corresponding longer-term averages. The GST has stabilized as a vital revenue source for central and state governments, with gross GST collections increasing at 24.8% on a YoY basis during April-December 2022.\\n\\nOn the expenditure side, the Union Government's emphasis on capital expenditure (Capex) has continued, with Capex steadily increasing from a long-term average of 1.7% of GDP (FY09 to FY20) to 2.5% of GDP in FY22 PA. The Centre has also incentivized State Governments through interest-free loans and enhanced borrowing ceilings to prioritize their spending on Capex. The increase in Capex has large-scale positive implications for medium-term growth. The government's fiscal policy response necessitated additional spending on food and fertilizer subsidies, accompanied by specific duty cuts to control the pass-through of high imported prices to consumers/users.\\n\\nThe fiscal deficit of the Union Government, which reached 9.2% of GDP during the pandemic year FY21, has moderated to 6.7% of GDP in FY22 PA and is further budgeted to reach 6.4% of GDP in FY23. The resilience in the fiscal performance of the Union Government has been facilitated by the recovery in economic activity, buoyancy in revenues from direct taxes and GST, and realistic assumptions in the Budget. The Gross Tax Revenue (GTR) to the Centre was envisaged to grow at 9.6% in FY23 BE relative to FY22 RE, but given the higher 'Provisional Actual' figures recorded for the GTR relative to the Revised estimates in FY22, the growth in GTR of FY23 BE turns out to be a mere 1.8% over FY22 PA.\\n\\nThe annual estimate of GTR for FY23 is expected to overshoot the budget estimates, with GTR growing at a much higher rate (15.5%) from April to November 2022. Direct taxes, which broadly constitute half of the Gross Tax Revenue, have registered a YoY growth of 26% from April to November 2022, enabled by corporate and personal income tax growth. Customs and excise duties have acted as flexible policy tools during the fiscal response to the pandemic, with the government raising excise duty on petrol and diesel to augment the revenue pool and subsequently reducing it to control inflationary pressures.\\n\\nThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) has evolved and stabilized as a vital revenue source for central and state governments, with gross GST collections growing at 24.8% on a YoY basis during April-December 2022. The improvement in GST collections is due to the combined effect of rapid economic recovery post-pandemic, nationwide drive against GST evaders and fake bills, and various rate rationalization measures undertaken by the GST Council. The number of GST taxpayers has doubled, increasing from nearly 70 lakh in 2017 to more than 1.4 crore in 2022.\\n\\nThe Union government's non-debt receipts comprise revenue receipts (tax and non-tax) and non-debt capital receipts. The shortfall in non-debt receipts to meet expenditure requirements is met by borrowings of the government (fiscal deficit). The government has reaffirmed its commitment towards privatization and strategic disinvestment of Public Sector Enterprises by implementing the New Public Sector Enterprise Policy and Asset Monetization Strategy. The government has provided 50-year interest-free loans to state governments under the 'Scheme for Special Assistance to States for Capital Investment' for the last three years, with an allocation of â‚¹1.05 lakh crore for FY23.\\n\\nThe Centre's capital expenditure has steadily increased from a long-term average of 1.7% of GDP (FY09 to FY20) to 2.5% of GDP in FY22 PA, and is further budgeted to increase to 2.9% of GDP in FY23. The government's thrust on capital expenditure, particularly in infrastructure-intensive sectors like roads and highways, railways, and housing and urban affairs, has longer-term implications for growth. The capital expenditure by the Centre registered a YoY growth of over 60% from April to November 2022, much higher than the long-term average growth of 13.5% recorded in the corresponding period from FY16 to FY20.\\n\\nThe revenue expenditure of the Union government was brought down from 15.6% of GDP in the pandemic year FY21 to 13.5% of GDP in FY22 PA. However, due to the sudden outbreak of geopolitical conflict, there was a higher food and fertilizer subsidy requirement, and the revenue expenditure from April to November 2022 has grown by over 10% on a YoY basis. Interest payments as a proportion of receipts went up after the pandemic outbreak, but are expected to come down in the medium term as the government moves along the fiscal glide path.\\n\\nThe General Government finances give an overview of the fiscal position of the Government sector as a whole. The General Government liabilities as a proportion of GDP increased steeply during FY21 on account of additional borrowings made by Centre and States on account of the pandemic. However, the ratio has come off its peak in FY22 (RE). The General Government deficits as a percent of GDP have also consolidated after their peak in FY21. The General Government is expected to follow the path of fiscal consolidation in the medium term.\\n\\nA positive growth-interest rate differential keeps the Government Debt sustainable, with India's public debt profile relatively stable and characterized by low currency and interest rate risks. The weighted average maturity of the outstanding stock of dated securities of the government has increased from 9.7 years in end-March 2010 to 11.71 years in end-March 2022, reducing rollover risk in the medium-term. The growth-interest rate differential has historically been positive for India, keeping debt levels sustainable.\\n\\nA counterfactual experiment shows that sustained growth of 10% per annum would have resulted in much lower Union Government deficit and debt ratios for India in the post-pandemic years, despite keeping the expenditure levels the same. There is a need for continued vigilance and adherence to the path of fiscal prudence, but an undue alarm is unwarranted. The Centre should continue incentivizing States for reforms and higher capital spending to ensure a stronger General government, and the capex-led growth strategy will ensure sustainable debt levels in the medium term.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Debt Profile of the Government\n\n## Debt Profile of the Government\n\n3.34  Given the unprecedented fiscal expansion in 2020, rising government liabilities have emerged as a significant concern across the globe. IMF projects 9 the global government debt at 91 per cent of GDP in 2022, about 7.5 percentage points above the pre-pandemic levels. While countries worldwide had started winding up the fiscal support provided during the pandemic, challenging global financial conditions amidst global uncertainties tightened budget constraints. 10  Some European economies are expanding their budgets to provide relief to households and small businesses from mounting energy bills (Figure III.13). All these factors, together with rising interest rates and the fear of slower growth, make the sustainability of sovereign debts a concern worldwide.\n\nFigure III.13: Increase in primary balance as a per cent of GDP by some countries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: IMF, Reserve bank of Australia\n\nNote: Primary Balance as a per cent of GDP has been taken from IMF; The lighter bars denote the additional fiscal spending announced by the countries in recent months (excluding the revenue generated from windfall profit taxes). Moderating Union Government Debt after the spike during the pandemic year\n\n7 https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/Publications/PDFs/RMF101120223A34C4F7023A4A9E99CB7F7FEF6881D0.PDF\n\n8 https://www.panchayat.gov.in/documents/448457/0/Assess+the+Availability+of+Resources+for+Creating+the+Assets+and+Initiatives+tak- en+for+Generating+Various+OSR+%281%29.pdf/b4a01029-d4f5-ab38-becb-b650b269f338?t=1669965866134\n\n9 IMF fiscal Monitor (Oct 2022)\n\n10 Global Financial Stability Report (Oct 2022)\n\n3.35  It is crucial to analyse India's government debt profile against this global backdrop. For India, the total liabilities of the Union Government, which were relatively stable as a percentage of GDP over the past decade, witnessed a sharp spike in the pandemic year FY21. This spike in  debt  resulted  from  the  pandemic-induced  higher  Government  borrowings  to  finance  the additional expenditure needs, given the strained revenues and sharp contraction in the GDP. Total liabilities of the Union Government moderated from 59.2 per cent of GDP in FY21 to 56.7 per cent in FY22 (P) (Figure III.14). A brief description of the major components of the total liabilities of the Union Government is given in Table III.9.\n\nFigure III.14: Moderating Union Government's Debt-GDP ratio after the pandemic induced-spike\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Various Issues of Status Paper on Government Debt\n\nNote: The Figures for FY22 are Provisional\n\nTable III.9: Debt Position of Union Government (in â‚¹ lakh crore)\n\n| components                   |   FY16 |   FY17 |   FY18 |   FY19 |   FY20 |   FY21 |   FY22 PA |\n|------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|\n|                              |   1    |   2    |   3    |   4    |   5    |   6    |      7    |\n| a. public Debt (A1+A2)       |  57.11 |  61.5  |  68.45 |  75.49 |  85.65 | 105.23 |    121.21 |\n| a1. internal Debt (a+b)      |  53.05 |  57.42 |  64.01 |  70.75 |  80.2  |  99.08 |    114.62 |\n| a. marketable securities     |  47.28 |  50.49 |  55.1  |  59.69 |  65.6  |  78.59 |     88.17 |\n| b.

FY FY20)\n\nStable debt profile with relatively low currency and interest rate risk\n\n3.36  India's public debt profile is relatively stable and is characterised by low currency and interest rate risks. During his speech at the South Centre in Geneva (April 2018), former RBI Governor Dr YV Reddy said, 'since most of India's public debt is held by the residents and denominated in domestic currency. I would, therefore, be less dogmatic on the fiscal deficit and public debt numbers and more emphatic about the context.' Of the Union Government's total net liabilities in end-March 2021, 95.1 per cent were denominated in domestic currency, while  sovereign  external  debt  constituted  4.9  per  cent,  implying  low  currency  risk  (Figure III.15). Further, sovereign external debt is entirely from official sources, which insulates it from volatility in the international capital markets.\n\nFigure III.15: Proportion of external liability in public debt (FY22)\n\nFigure III.16: Elongation of the maturity profile of outstanding Dated union Government securities\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: PDMC, DEA\n\nSource: Various Issues of Status Paper on Government Debt Note: The Figures for FY22 are Provisional\n\n3.37.      Public debt in India is primarily contracted at fixed interest rates, with floating internal debt constituting only 1.7 per cent of GDP in end-March 2021. The debt portfolio is, therefore, insulated from interest rate volatility, which also provides stability to interest payments. The weighted average maturity of the outstanding stock of dated securities of the government has increased from 9.7 years in end-March 2010 to 11.71 years in end-March 2022, thus reducing\n\nthe rollover risk in the medium-term (Figure III.16). Over the last few years, the proportion of dated securities maturing in less than five years has declined, whereas long-term securities have shown an increasing trend.\n\n## consolidating General government finances\n\n3.38. The General Government finances give an overview of fiscal position of the Government sector  as  a  whole.  Figure  III.17  shows  the  trends  in  General  Government  debt  and  deficits over the past few years. The General Government liabilities as a proportion of GDP increased steeply during FY21 on account of the additional borrowings made by Centre and States on account of the pandemic. However, the ratio has come off its peak in FY22 (RE). The General Government deficits as a per cent of GDP have also consolidated after their peak in F21. The General Government is expected to follow the path of fiscal consolidation in the medium term.\n\nFigure III.17: General Government liabilities to GDP ratio come off their peak attained in FY21\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI\n\n## A positive growth-interest rate differential keeps the Government Debt sustainable\n\n3.39. The emphasis on capex in recent years is expected to boost GDP growth directly, and indirectly through multiplier effects on private consumption expenditure and private investment. Higher GDP growth would thereby facilitate buoyant revenue collection in the medium term, and thereby enable a sustainable fiscal path. The General Government Debt to GDP ratio increased from 75.7 per cent of end-March 2020 to 89.6 per cent at the end of the pandemic year FY21. It is estimated to decline to 84.5 per cent of GDP by end-March 2022. The emphasis on capexled growth will enable India to keep the growth-interest rate differential positive. As shown in Figure III.18 below, this differential has historically been positive for India. A positive growthinterest rate differential keeps the debt levels sustainable. Box III.5 shows that steady economic growth will accelerate fiscal consolidation in the economy.\n\nFigure III.18: Growth-interest rate differential for India\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI, IMF\n\n3.40. A comparison of the change in General Government debt to GDP ratio from 2005 to 2021 across the countries highlights a substantial increase for most countries. For India, this increase is  modest, from 81 per cent of GDP in 2005 to around 84 per cent of GDP in 2021 (Figure III.19). It has been possible on the back of resilient economic growth during the last 15 years leading to a positive growth-interest rate differential, which, in turn, has resulted in sustainable Government debt to GDP levels.\n\nFigure III.19: Comparing General Government debt to GDP ratio in 2005 with 2021 across the countries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: World Economic Outlook, October 2022.\n\n## Box III.5: Sustained growth as the path to fiscal consolidation\n\nThe high fiscal deficit to GDP ratio witnessed in the aftermath of the pandemic is a concern for countries worldwide. A solution to the increased fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios lies in persistently high growth for a few years. A simple counterfactual experiment shows that sustained growth of 10 per cent per annum would have resulted in much lower Union Government deficit and debt ratios for India in the post-pandemic years, despite keeping the expenditure levels the same.\n\nUnder Scenario 1, the impact of a higher nominal GDP growth is evaluated on fiscal deficit and debt ratios, keeping the revenues and expenditures the same as actual. A counterfactual nominal GDP is estimated, assuming a growth rate of 10 per cent each year from FY20 to FY22. The actual Central Government fiscal deficit as a per cent of the counterfactual GDP is estimated as 4.5 per cent in FY20, 8 per cent in FY21, and 6.3 per cent in FY22, lower than the actual ratios observed (see rows (A) and (E) of Table 5A). Similarly, the ratio of Central Government debt to the estimated GDP is also lower than the actual debt-GDP ratio (see rows (B) and (F) of Table 5A).\n\nTable 5A: Counterfactual Experiment to show sustained growth results in lower deficit and debt ratios\n\n|                                             | FY19   | FY20   | FY21   | FY22   | Row   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|\n| Actual GDP(â‚¹ lakh crore)                    | 189.0  | 200.7  | 198.0  | 236.6  |       |\n| Growth in actual GDP(%)                     |        | 6.2    | -1.4   | 19.5   |       |\n| Assumed growth in GDP(%)                    |        | 10.0   | 10.0   | 10.0   |       |\n| Estimated GDP(â‚¹ lakh crore)                 |        | 207.9  | 228.7  | 251.6  |       |\n| scenario 1                                  |        |        |        |        |       |\n| Actual Fiscal Deficit/Estimated GDP(%)      |        | 4.5    | 8.0    | 6.3    | (A)   |\n| Actual Central Govt Debt/Estimated GDP(%)   |        | 50.9   | 54.8   | 55.5   | (B)   |\n| scenario 2                                  |        |        |        |        |       |\n| Assumed revenue buoyancy                    |        | 0.8    | 1.6    | 1.6    |       |\n| Estimated revenue collection (â‚¹ lakh crore) |        | 18.1   | 21.0   | 24.3   |       |\n| Estimated fiscal deficit (â‚¹ lakh crore)     |        | 8.8    | 14.1   | 13.7   |       |\n| Estimated fiscal deficit/ Estimated GDP     |        | 4.2    | 6.2    | 5.4    | (C)   |\n| scenario 3                                  |        |        |        |        |       |\n| Assumed revenue buoyancy                    |        | 0.8    | 0.9    | 1.6    |       |\n| Estimated revenue collection (â‚¹ lakh crore) |        | 18.1   | 19.6   | 22.7   |       |\n| Estimated fiscal deficit (â‚¹ lakh crore)     |        | 8.8    | 15.5   | 15.2   |       |\n| Estimated fiscal deficit/ Estimated GDP     |        | 4.2    | 6.8    | 6.1    | (D)   |\n\n| memo items                             |      |      |      |      |     |\n|----------------------------------------|------|------|------|------|-----|\n| Actual Expenditure (â‚¹ lakh crore)      | 23.2 | 26.9 | 35.1 | 37.9 |     |\n| Actual Revenues (â‚¹ lakh crore)         | 16.7 | 17.5 | 16.9 | 22.1 |     |\n| Actual Fiscal deficit (â‚¹ lakh crore)   | 6.5  |  9.3 | 18.2 | 15.9 |     |\n| Actual Fiscal Deficit/Actual GDP(%)    |      |  4.7 |  9.2 |  6.7 | (E) |\n| Actual Central Govt Debt/Actual GDP(%) |      | 52.7 | 63.3 | 59   | (F) |\n\nSources: Newspaper reports, RBI\n\nHowever, higher GDP growth rate also impacts the fiscal deficit through higher revenues. Scenario 2 of the analysis incorporates the impact of higher GDP growth on the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio through the revenue channel. The expenditure levels were retained as actuals in the analysis. The actual  revenue  buoyancies  for  FY20  and  FY22  and  the  budgeted  revenue  buoyancy  for  FY21 were considered to quantify the impact of higher GDP growth on revenues. The budgeted revenue buoyancy was taken for FY21 because the actual buoyancy ratio could not be interpreted in the year of  nominal  GDP  contraction. The  fiscal  deficit  was  calculated  using  the  estimated  revenues  and actual expenditures for respective years. The estimated fiscal deficit as a proportion of GDP came out to be 4.2 for FY20, 6.2 for FY21, and 5.4 for FY22, much lower than the actual observed (see rows (C) and (E) of Table 5A).\n\nFurther, we see in scenario 3 that by taking the previous 5-year average revenue buoyancy for FY21 instead of the budgeted buoyancy and retaining actual revenue buoyancies for FY20 and FY22, the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio is still lower than the actual observed (see rows (D) and (E) of Table 5A).\n\nThe  messages  from  this  counterfactual  exercise  are  simple:  even  moderate  growth,  if  sustained, will support fiscal consolidation in the medium run and result in sustainable public finances. Two, India's public debt and deficit ratios went up sharply in recent years, not just on account of higher spending and lower tax revenues due to the pandemic but also due to the denominator undershooting trends resulting from financial system stress, followed by the pandemic. With both out of the way, nominal growth should return to its trend path, and hence, fiscal parameters would begin to show improvement. There is a need for continued vigilance and adherence to the path of fiscal prudence, but an undue alarm is unwarranted.",
