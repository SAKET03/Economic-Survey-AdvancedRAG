The consumer price inflation in India went through three phases in 2022: a rising phase up to April 2022, a holding pattern at around 7.0% up to August 2022, and a decline to around 5.7% by December 2022.\\n\\n### Inflation Phases\\n\\n* The rising phase was largely due to the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war and a shortfall in crop harvests due to excessive heat in some parts of the country.\\n* Prompt and adequate measures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have reined in the rise in inflation and brought it within the Central Bank's tolerance limit.\\n\\n### Comparison with Western Countries\\n\\n* In contrast, major Western countries, which pumped stimulus during the pandemic periods, continue to grapple with high levels of inflation.\\n\\n### Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI)\\n\\n* The divergence between a relatively high WPI inflation and lower CPI inflation widened in May 2022, primarily owing to a difference in relative weights of the two indices and the lagged effect of imported input costs on retail prices.\\n* However, the gap between the two measures of inflation has reduced since then, demonstrating a tendency towards convergence.\\n\\n### Core Inflation\\n\\n* An important measure of demand-pull inflation - core inflation - remains sticky.\\n* There have been significant variations in retail inflation rates among the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India.\\n\\n### Housing Price Index (HPI)\\n\\n* According to Housing Price Index (HPI) published by National Housing Bank (NHB), the overall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market price in Quarter Ending (QE) September 2022 over QE September 2021 indicates a revival in the housing finance sector.\\n\\n### Monetary Policy\\n\\n* RBI's Monetary Policy Committee increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 225 basis points from 4.0% to 6.25% between May and December 2022.\\n* Central Government has undertaken fiscal measures like reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, prohibition of the export of wheat products, imposition of export duty on rice, reduction in import duties and cess on pulses, rationalisation of tariffs and imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds, maintenance of buffer stock for onion and pulses and rationalisation of import duties on raw materials used in the manufactured products.\\n\\n### Inflation Forecast\\n\\n* The RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term, owing to supply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike, reflecting high feed costs.\\n* In general, climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to food prices.\\n\\n### Key Policy Recommendations\\n\\n* The government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices.\\n* India's retail inflation rate peaked at 7.8% in April 2022. The overshoot of inflation above the upper end of the target range in India was one of the lowest in the world.\\n\\n### Findings\\n\\n* The year 2022 was marked by a return of high inflation in the advanced world after three to four decades, depending on the country.\\n* In India, the government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices.\\n\\n### Retail Inflation\\n\\n* Retail inflation was mainly driven by higher food inflation, while core inflation stayed at a moderate level.\\n* Food inflation ranged between 4.2% to 8.6% between April and December 2022, while the core inflation rate stayed at around 6% except in April 2022.\\n\\n### Food Inflation\\n\\n* Food inflation based on Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) climbed to 7.0% in FY23 from 3.8% in FY22.\\n* The major contributors to food inflation are vegetables, cereals, milk, and spices.\\n\\n### Rural-Urban Inflation Differential\\n\\n* Rural inflation has remained above its urban counterpart throughout the current fiscal year, reversing the trend seen during the pandemic years.\\n\\n### Wholesale Price Inflation\\n\\n* WPI-based inflation remained low during the Covid-19 period and started to gain momentum in the post-pandemic period as economic activities resumed.\\n* The wholesale inflation rate climbed to about 13.0% in FY22.\\n\\n### Convergence of WPI and CPI Inflation\\n\\n* The headline inflation based on WPI and the CPI-C started diverging in March 2021, as WPI inflation touched double digits due to unfavourable base effects while CPI-C inflation remained stable.\\n* The gap began to narrow until April 2022. The path to convergence, however, was short-lived as another inflationary pressure started building up in February 2022.\\n\\n### Inflationary Expectations\\n\\n* Inflationary expectations are decisive in charting the course of inflation.\\n* The RBI's anchoring of inflationary expectations through forward guidance and responsive monetary policy has helped guide the trajectory of inflation in the country.\\n\\n### Housing Prices\\n\\n* Housing prices provide helpful information on the state of the economy via booms and busts in asset markets, which give rise to economic imbalances.\\n* Monitoring housing prices is essential for achieving the objectives of price stability, financial stability, and growth.\\n\\n### Pharmaceutical Prices\\n\\n* The principles for the regulation of the prices of drugs are based on the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Policy, 2012, administered by the Department of Pharmaceuticals.\\n* The key principles of the policy are the essentiality of drugs, control of formulation prices, and market-based pricing.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\n* It is not wishful thinking that 2023 will show less macroeconomic volatility than its preceding financial year.\\n* Both CPI-C and WPI have fallen below 6% (which is the RBI tolerance limit for the former) and are on the descending slope of the surge that hit the economy in the first half of the current fiscal.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Domestic Wholesale Price Inflation\n\n## Domestic Wholesale Price Inflation\n\n## Wholesale Price Inflation Caused by Global Supply Chain Disruption\n\n5.19  WPI-based  inflation  remained  low  during  the  Covid-19  period,  and  it  started  to  gain momentum in the post-pandemic period as economic activities resumed. The Russia-Ukraine conflict further exacerbated the burden as it worsened global supply chains along with the free movement of essential commodities. As a result, the wholesale inflation rate climbed to about 13.0  per  cent  in  FY22.  Prices  of  items  like  petroleum  products,  basic  metals,  chemicals  &amp; chemical products, and edible oils, with maximum exposure to international pricing translated into a rise in the domestic WPI inflation.\n\nTable V.2: Average Annual Wholesale Inflation Based on WPI (per cent) (Base: 2011-12=100)\n\n| Groups/Subgroups                                     |   Weight |   FY20 |   FY21 |   FY22 |   FY23* |\n|------------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Primary Articles                                     |     22.6 |    6.8 |    1.7 |   10.3 |    12.3 |\n| Food articles                                        |     15.3 |    8.4 |    3.1 |    4.1 |     8.3 |\n| Cereals                                              |      2.8 |    7.5 |   -2.6 |    1.6 |    10.7 |\n| Pulses                                               |      0.6 |   15.9 |   11.6 |    6.9 |     0   |\n| Vegetables                                           |      1.9 |   31.2 |    3.4 |    0.4 |    13.2 |\n| Fruits                                               |      1.6 |    3.2 |    1.4 |   11.3 |    10.4 |\n| Non-Food Articles                                    |      4.1 |    4.5 |    1.4 |   21.1 |    12   |\n| Minerals                                             |      0.8 |   13.2 |    6.7 |   19.6 |     6.2 |\n| Crude Petroleum &Natural Gas                         |      2.4 |   -7.7 |  -17.5 |   56.7 |    57.7 |\n| Fuel &power                                          |     13.2 |   -1.8 |   -8   |   32.6 |    33.8 |\n| LPG                                                  |      0.6 |   -8.3 |   -2.7 |   43.3 |    16.9 |\n| Petrol                                               |      1.6 |   -3.2 |  -11.8 |   62.9 |    41.9 |\n| High Speed Diesel                                    |      3.1 |   -3.5 |  -14.4 |   59.9 |    60.8 |\n| Manufactured Products                                |     64.2 |    0.3 |    2.7 |   11.1 |     7.1 |\n| Food products                                        |      9.1 |    4.1 |    5.6 |   11.7 |     6   |\n| Edible oils                                          |      2.6 |    1.4 |   20.3 |   30.5 |     1.4 |\n| Food Inflation (Food articles + Food products)       |     24.4 |    6.9 |    3.9 |    6.8 |     7.5 |\n| Core Inflation (Manufactured Products-Food products) |     55.1 |   -0.4 |    2.2 |   11   |     9.2 |\n| Headline Inflation                                   |    100   |    1.7 |    1.3 |   13   |    11.5 |\n\nSource: Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\n\nNote: *April-December 2022, WPI data for November and December 2022 are provisional\n\n- 5.20  Part of the double-digit inflation in WPI during H1 of FY23 could be attributed to food inflation,  which stayed at 7.5 per cent against 6.8 per cent in FY22. Cereals and vegetables were the major contributors to food inflation owing to erratic climatic conditons. Inflation in the  'manufactured products' subgroup in FY23 saw a considerable decline compared to the previous year due to the rationalisation of duties on critical inputs and moderation in global commodity prices. In comparison to FY22, core inflation remained lower in FY23.\n- 5.21  Overall, the monthly trend of inflation rates based on wholesale prices has been sliding downwards from its peak of 16.6 per cent in May 2022 to 10.6 per cent in September 2022 and further to 5.0 per cent in December 2022. The decline in inflation was observed in all three subgroups of WPI.\n- 5.22  As mentioned earlier,  part  of  WPI  inflation  is  imported  inflation.  The  high  import  dependence on edible oils has meant that the transitory effect of rising international prices of these products are also reflected in domestic prices. An RBI study 3 indicates that one per cent increase in prices across all the countries and sectors due to global inflation shock could increase inflation in India by around 63 basis points through second-round effects comprising domestic indirect effects (46\n\n3 Monetary Policy Report, RBI, September 2022\n\nbasis points) and global spillovers (17 basis points), in addition to the direct impact of 100 basis points. The impact of prices in world markets on WPI (manufactured products component) was clearly visible, especially in prices of oil and basic metals. In the current financial year, global prices of edible oils, rubber, cotton, crude oil, and metals decreased. Capital outflows in H1 of FY23 had impacted India's exchange rate adversely; this was another reason for high prices of imported inputs, which are mostly dollar-denominated.\n\nFigure V.14: Declining Core and Food Inflation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\n\nFigure V.15: Drivers of Wholesale Inflation in FY23* - 'Primary Articles' &amp; 'Fuel &amp; Power'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\n\nNote: *April-December\n\nFigure V.16: Slackening Global Commodity Prices\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Pink Sheet, World Bank\n\nNote: *dmtu:dry metric tonne unit\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Box V.2: Measures to Contain Inflation in Input Prices\n\n-  Fuel Prices: The  Central  Government has made interventions by calibrating the excise duties on petrol and diesel. The first phase of reduction in terms of ` 5 on petrol and ` 10 on diesel was made effective from 4 November 2021 and the second phase from 22 May 2022 ( ` 8 per litre on petrol and ` 6 per litre on diesel).\n-  Plastic products: The import duty on import of raw materials used in the plastic industry has been  reduced  to  lower  the  cost  of  domestic  manufacturing.  The  duties  on  naphtha,  propylene oxide and polymers of vinyl chloride have been reduced from 2.5 per cent to 1 per cent, 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent and from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent, respectively on 21 May 2022.\n-  Steel: On 21 May 2022, import duty on major inputs - ferronickel, cooking coal, PCI coal - has been  cut  from  2.5  per  cent  to  zero,  while  the  duty  on  coke  and  semi-coke  has  been  slashed from 5 per cent to zero. Tax on export of iron ores and concentrates has increased from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, while that on iron pellets has been raised to 45 per cent.\n-  cotton: The  government  waived  customs  duty  on  cotton  imports  w.e.f  14  April  2022,  until 30  September  2022,  to  benefit  the  textile  industry  and  lower  prices  for  consumers.  Earlier, cotton  imports  attracted  5  per  cent  Basic  Customs  Duty  (BCD)  and  5  per  cent  AIDC.  The Central  Board  of  Indirect  Taxes  and  Customs  (CBIC)  notified  the  exemption  from  customs duty and AIDC for import of cotton.\n-  Diamonds and gemstones: In Budget 2022-2023, customs duty on cut and polished diamonds and gemstones was reduced to 5 per cent and duty on the simply sawn diamond was reduced to nil.\n-  Chemical products: Customs duty on certain critical chemicals namely methanol, acetic acid and heavy feedstocks for petroleum refining was reduced in the Budget 2022-23.",
