The consumer price inflation in India went through three phases in 2022: a rising phase up to April 2022, a holding pattern at around 7.0% up to August 2022, and a decline to around 5.7% by December 2022.\\n\\n### Inflation Phases\\n\\n* The rising phase was largely due to the fallout of the Russia-Ukraine war and a shortfall in crop harvests due to excessive heat in some parts of the country.\\n* Prompt and adequate measures by the Government of India and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have reined in the rise in inflation and brought it within the Central Bank's tolerance limit.\\n\\n### Comparison with Western Countries\\n\\n* In contrast, major Western countries, which pumped stimulus during the pandemic periods, continue to grapple with high levels of inflation.\\n\\n### Wholesale Price Index (WPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI)\\n\\n* The divergence between a relatively high WPI inflation and lower CPI inflation widened in May 2022, primarily owing to a difference in relative weights of the two indices and the lagged effect of imported input costs on retail prices.\\n* However, the gap between the two measures of inflation has reduced since then, demonstrating a tendency towards convergence.\\n\\n### Core Inflation\\n\\n* An important measure of demand-pull inflation - core inflation - remains sticky.\\n* There have been significant variations in retail inflation rates among the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India.\\n\\n### Housing Price Index (HPI)\\n\\n* According to Housing Price Index (HPI) published by National Housing Bank (NHB), the overall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market price in Quarter Ending (QE) September 2022 over QE September 2021 indicates a revival in the housing finance sector.\\n\\n### Monetary Policy\\n\\n* RBI's Monetary Policy Committee increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 225 basis points from 4.0% to 6.25% between May and December 2022.\\n* Central Government has undertaken fiscal measures like reduction in excise duty on petrol and diesel, prohibition of the export of wheat products, imposition of export duty on rice, reduction in import duties and cess on pulses, rationalisation of tariffs and imposition of stock limits on edible oils and oil seeds, maintenance of buffer stock for onion and pulses and rationalisation of import duties on raw materials used in the manufactured products.\\n\\n### Inflation Forecast\\n\\n* The RBI forecasts elevated domestic prices for cereals and spices in the near term, owing to supply shortages. Milk prices are also expected to spike, reflecting high feed costs.\\n* In general, climate across the world has become increasingly erratic, further fortifying upside risks to food prices.\\n\\n### Key Policy Recommendations\\n\\n* The government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices.\\n* India's retail inflation rate peaked at 7.8% in April 2022. The overshoot of inflation above the upper end of the target range in India was one of the lowest in the world.\\n\\n### Findings\\n\\n* The year 2022 was marked by a return of high inflation in the advanced world after three to four decades, depending on the country.\\n* In India, the government and the central bank took decisive measures to cap the rise in prices.\\n\\n### Retail Inflation\\n\\n* Retail inflation was mainly driven by higher food inflation, while core inflation stayed at a moderate level.\\n* Food inflation ranged between 4.2% to 8.6% between April and December 2022, while the core inflation rate stayed at around 6% except in April 2022.\\n\\n### Food Inflation\\n\\n* Food inflation based on Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) climbed to 7.0% in FY23 from 3.8% in FY22.\\n* The major contributors to food inflation are vegetables, cereals, milk, and spices.\\n\\n### Rural-Urban Inflation Differential\\n\\n* Rural inflation has remained above its urban counterpart throughout the current fiscal year, reversing the trend seen during the pandemic years.\\n\\n### Wholesale Price Inflation\\n\\n* WPI-based inflation remained low during the Covid-19 period and started to gain momentum in the post-pandemic period as economic activities resumed.\\n* The wholesale inflation rate climbed to about 13.0% in FY22.\\n\\n### Convergence of WPI and CPI Inflation\\n\\n* The headline inflation based on WPI and the CPI-C started diverging in March 2021, as WPI inflation touched double digits due to unfavourable base effects while CPI-C inflation remained stable.\\n* The gap began to narrow until April 2022. The path to convergence, however, was short-lived as another inflationary pressure started building up in February 2022.\\n\\n### Inflationary Expectations\\n\\n* Inflationary expectations are decisive in charting the course of inflation.\\n* The RBI's anchoring of inflationary expectations through forward guidance and responsive monetary policy has helped guide the trajectory of inflation in the country.\\n\\n### Housing Prices\\n\\n* Housing prices provide helpful information on the state of the economy via booms and busts in asset markets, which give rise to economic imbalances.\\n* Monitoring housing prices is essential for achieving the objectives of price stability, financial stability, and growth.\\n\\n### Pharmaceutical Prices\\n\\n* The principles for the regulation of the prices of drugs are based on the National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Policy, 2012, administered by the Department of Pharmaceuticals.\\n* The key principles of the policy are the essentiality of drugs, control of formulation prices, and market-based pricing.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\n* It is not wishful thinking that 2023 will show less macroeconomic volatility than its preceding financial year.\\n* Both CPI-C and WPI have fallen below 6% (which is the RBI tolerance limit for the former) and are on the descending slope of the surge that hit the economy in the first half of the current fiscal.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Convergence of WPI and CPI Inflation\n\n## Convergence of WPI and CPI Inflation\n\n5.24  Inflation dynamics in India since the outbreak of the pandemic have been influenced by various domestic and global factors. While the pass-through of international prices to wholesale prices is relatively quick, it impacts retail prices with a lag. This creates a wedge between WPI and CPI inflation rates. It is also due to the difference in composition and weights assigned to different commodities in the two indices.\n\n5.25  The headline inflation based on WPI and the CPI-C started diverging in March 2021, as WPI inflation  touched  double  digits  due  to  unfavourable  base  effects  while  CPI-C  inflation remained  stable.  The  wedge  between  CPI-C  and  WPI  inflation  continued  to  widen  before reaching its peak at 10 per cent in November 2021. Thereafter, the gap began to narrow until April 2022. The path to convergence, however, was short-lived as another inflationary pressure started building up in February 2022 as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The major brunt of commodity supply chain disruption and increased demand for essentials was reflected in WPI with a short lag of 2 months. As a result, the two indicators of inflation again started diverging in May 2022. It was only after global commodity prices, including crude oil, softened and the effects of strong supporting domestic factors like favourable monsoon, vaccination-led economic resumption, etc., started to be felt that the wedge began to narrow, and it closed in November 2022, after 21 months. It also indicated the near completion of the pass-through of high input costs to the retail segment.\n\n5.26  The convergence between the WPI and CPI indices was mainly driven by two factors. Firstly,  a  cooling  in  inflation  of  commodities  such  as  crude  oil,  iron,  aluminium  and  cotton led to a lower WPI. These commodities occupy a larger weight in the WPI as compared to the CPI. Further, these commodities are highly vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices and\n\nare used intensively by industries producing wholesale goods. As the prices cooled for these commodities, the two measures of inflation began to converge. Secondly, CPI inflation rose due to an increase in the prices of services. Services form a part of the core component of the CPI-C but are not included in the WPI basket.\n\nFigure V.18: Convergence of Headline WPI Inflation with Headline CPI-C Inflation\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\n\nFigure V.19: Convergence in Core Inflation - CPI-C vs WPI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\n\nFigure V.20: Convergence in Food Inflation - CPI-C vs WPI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\n\nFigure V.21: Convergence Between CPI (Fuel &amp; Power) and WPI (Fuel &amp; Light) Inflation Rates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\n\nFigure V.22: Convergence Between Retail and Wholesale Energy Inflation Rates\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: MoSPI and Office of Economic Adviser, DPIIT\n\n## Falling Inflationary Expectations\n\n5.27  Inflationary  expectations  are  decisive  in  charting  the  course  of  inflation.  The  RBI's anchoring  of  inflationary  expectations  through  forward  guidance  and  responsive  monetary policy has helped guide the trajectory of inflation in the country. The one-year-ahead inflationary expectations by businesses have shown a decreasing trend in the current fiscal. As businesses are price-setters, their perceptions on inflation are significant in making sense of whether costs would be passed on, resulting in higher prices in the near future. Similarly, inflationary expectations by households- who are the price takers of the economy- determine their consumption choices in the near future. Much like businesses, household inflation expectations too have moderated.\n\nFigure V.23: Business and Household Inflationary Expectations are Falling\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: IIM-A and RBI\n\n## M onetary P olicy M easures for Price s tability\n\n- 5.28  Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) increased the policy repo rate under the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) by 2.25 per cent (225 basis points) from 4.0 per cent to 6.25 per cent between May and December 2022.\n\nTable V.3: Monetary Policy Statements - Tightening Monetary Policy\n\n| DateofMPCStatements   | Changes in the Policy Repo Rate under the LAF                  |\n|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 8 April 2022          | Unchanged at 4 per cent                                        |\n| 4 May 2022            | Increased from 4.0 per cent to 4.4 per cent (40 basis points)  |\n| 8 June 2022           | Increased from 4.4 per cent to 4.9 per cent (50 basis points)  |\n| 5 August 2022         | Increased from 4.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent (50 basis points)  |\n| 30 September 2022     | Increased from 5.4 per cent to 5.9 per cent (50 basis points)  |\n| 7 December 2022       | Increased from 5.9 per cent to 6.25 per cent (35 basis points) |\n\nSource: RBI\n\n## Box V.3: How is the Current Inflation Different from the 1970s?\n\nUnprecedented global inflation in the current year recalls the experience of the 1970's, particularly the aftermath of the oil crises in 1973 and 1979. Both crises contributed to rising commodity prices worldwide  and  their  spill-over  effects  on  the  prices  of  other  goods  and  services.  However,  the environment and intensity of the crises differ in various respects.\n\nFirstly ,  recent  oil  price  rises  are  proportionally  smaller  than  the  1970s  crisis,  which  had  taken  oil prices to historic highs.\n\nSecondly , in contrast to the 1970s crisis, which was confined to oil prices, the recent crisis has seen pervasive  price  increases  across  a  broader  range  of  commodities.  Prices  of  non-oil  energy,  some agricultural goods, fertilisers, and metals have all risen well above their pre-pandemic levels in the current year.\n\nThirdly , commodity supply disruptions have played a smaller role in recent price increases than in the 1970s. The rise in commodity prices over the past year has been accompanied by a modest rise in the production of many commodities, although not oil. Global commodity supply chains have now become more efficient than in the 1970s and hence, the inflationary pressure can be absorbed with greater ease. However, supply disruptions could intensify over the coming year, as the war in Ukraine will lower global production of wheat, maize and fertilisers, while price caps on Russian oil and gas may reduce the supply of these products.\n\nFourthly , global inflation, which has risen significantly since the start of 2021, follows several years of low inflation. In contrast to this, the 1973 crisis took place against a backdrop of several years of steadily rising world inflation and signs of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.\n\nLastly ,  the 1973 crisis closely followed the collapse of the Bretton Woods managed exchange rate regime as the goals and even instruments of monetary policy were poorly defined in many countries. Arguably, central banks have much clearer and more robust institutional frameworks that focus on price stability today. This has prevented inflation expectations of the public from becoming unanchored despite a sharp rise in inflation during the year 2022.\n\nBesides commodity market behaviour, higher energy prices could matter less today than in the past. With better coordination among the global central banks and the application of unconventional monetary policy tools, inflation has been controlled in a better way so that its negative spillovers are limited and transitory. The energy intensity of GDP - the amount of energy required to produce a given amount of goods and services - has fallen by around 40 per cent since the late 1970s. With the diversification of input baskets and destinations for sourcing, commodity shocks' impact has been tamed to some extent. Hence, we may expect recent commodity price rises to be less disruptive than those of the 1970s.\n\nSource: Annual Economic Report, June 2022 by Bank for International Settlements and Vox EU, 2022 (https://bit.ly/3XpYqsI)\n\n## Housing Prices: Recovering Housing Sector After the Pandemic\n\n- 5.29  Housing prices provide helpful information on the state of the economy via booms and busts in asset markets, which give rise to economic imbalances. Monitoring housing prices is essential for achieving the objectives of price stability, financial stability, and growth.  Movements in these prices affect consumption spending through its effects on household wealth and consumer confidence.\n- 5.30  The National Housing Bank (NHB) publishes two Housing Price Indices (HPI), namely 'HPI  assessment  price'  and  'HPI  market  price  quarterly',  with  FY18  as  the  base  year.  HPI assessment price is based on the valuation prices of residential units collected from primary lending institutions. In contrast, the HPI market price is based on the market prices for unsold inventories collected from developers. A composite index is calculated for 50 cities across India using the population of the cities as weights.\n- 5.31  The annual variation in HPI market price ranged from an increase of 37.7 per cent in Bhubaneshwar to a contraction of 6.5 per cent in Indore in the Quarter Ending (QE) Sept 22 over QE Sept 21. Out of the 50 cities, 43 saw an increase in the index, whereas 7 cities showed a decline annually. All of the eight major metros of the country, viz., Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and Pune, recorded increases in the index on an annual basis.\n- 5.32  The annual change in HPI assessment price varied widely across the cities ranging from an increase of 20.2 per cent in Gandhinagar to a decline of 2.3 per cent in Bhiwadi in the QE Sept 22 over QE Sept 21. Out of the 50 cities, 46 cities registered an increase in the index, whereas 4 cities experienced a decline, on an annual basis. All of the eight major metros of the country witnessed an annual increase in the index.\n\nFigure V.24:  HPI for Metro Cities - Boom in 'Ahmedabad' and 'Hyderabad'\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RESIDEX, NHB\n\nFigure V.25:  Composite HPI for All-India - Recovering Housing House\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RESIDEX, NHB\n\n5.33  The  Covid-19  crisis  significantly  impacted  the  residential  real  estate  market.  Health concerns  and  stay-at-home  orders  led  to  fewer  buyers  looking  for  homes  during  the  initial phase of the pandemic in April-June, 2020. Subsequently, India's real estate industry gained momentum from September 2020 onwards and peaked in the quarter ending in March 2021. The second wave of the pandemic affected the real estate sector yet again when home buyers delayed  purchases  due  to  mounting  uncertainty  and  restricted  movement.  However,  timely policy intervention by the government coupled with low home loan interest rates propped up demand and attracted buyers more readily in the affordable segment in FY23.  The overall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market prices indicates a revival in the housing finance sector. A stable to moderate increase in HPI also offers confidence to homeowners and home loan financiers in terms of the retained value of the asset.\n\n## Box V.4: NHBs Support to the Housing Finance Sector (HFC)\n\nThe last three years were challenging for the housing sector. NHB has provided a significant impetus to obviate the liquidity issues faced by the Housing Finance Sector in the last 3 years.\n\n-  The  Liquidity  Infusion  Facility  Scheme  was  launched  in  2019  to  support  HFCs  in  creating individual housing loan portfolios that fall under the priority sector, as defined by the RBI.\n-  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Special Refinance Facility (SRF) was launched for disbursing an amount of ` 10,000 crore provided by RBI under the Special Liquidity Facility and an amount of ` 5,000 crore allocated by RBI under an Additional Special Liquidity Facility.\n-  During 2020-21, SRF 2021 was launched with a corpus of ` 10,000 crore provided by RBI under SLF-2. NHB has provided refinance disbursement of ` 3.3 lakh crore since inception, of which ` 0.84 lakh crore were disbursed during last 3 financial years.\n-  Also, as a part of the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav (AKAM), NHB has extended concessions of 25/30 basis points under refinance for the various categories including women, rural areas, SC/ ST,  aspirational  districts,  north-eastern  region,  loans  to  third  gender/differently  abled/disabled, UTs of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Ladakh, and green housing.\n\n-  In  view  of  the  nation's  commitment  at  COP26  to  reach  net-zero  emission  by  2070,  NHB  has extended 100 bps concession for loans under Green Housing.\n-  As  part  of AKAM  and  to  increase  the  credit  offtake  in  geographically  underpenetrated  areas which are a national priority, NHB has decided to extend 100 bps concession and refinance for loans in designated aspirational districts, north-eastern States, Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Ladakh, until September 2023.\n\n## Keeping check on Phamaceutical Prices\n\n5.34  The  principles  for  the  regulation  of  the  prices  of  drugs  are  based  on  the  National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Policy, 2012, administered by the Department of Pharmaceuticals. The key principles of the policy are the essentiality of drugs, control of formulation prices and market-based pricing. Until 31 December 2022, ceiling prices for 890 formulations of 358 drugs/medicines across various therapeutic categories under National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), 2015 have been fixed by National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority. Subsequently,  NLEM  2022  was  promulgated  by  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare in September 2022 and revised Schedule I of Drugs (Prices Control) Order (DPCO) was notified  on  11  November  2022  by  Department  of  Pharmaceuticals  incorporating  NLEM, 2022.  Ceiling  prices  of  119  formulations  under  NLEM,  2022  have  been  fixed  until  31 December 2022. In addition, retail prices for 2,196 formulations have been fixed under the DPCO, 2013.\n\n5.35  Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched to make quality generic medicines available at affordable prices to all. Under this scheme, dedicated outlets known as Janaushadhi Kendras are opened to provide quality generic medicines at affordable prices  to  all  and  especially  to  the  poor  and  the  deprived.  Further,  Pradhan  Mantri  Bhartiya Janaushadhi  Kendras  (PMBJKs)  also  provide  self-employment  with  sustainable  and  regular earnings opportunities. Under the PMBJP, until 31 December 2022, more than 9000 PMBJKs have been opened across the country. At present, the product basket of PMBJP comprises 1759 medicines and 280 surgical devices available for sale.",
