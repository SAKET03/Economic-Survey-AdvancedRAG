  "content": "Chapter 8 Summary:\nThe agriculture and allied sector has been performing well, with an average annual growth rate of 4.6% over the last six years. In 2021-22, the sector grew by 3.0% compared to 3.3% in 2020-21. India has emerged as a net exporter of agricultural products, with exports reaching an all-time high of $50.2 billion in 2021-22. The government has taken measures to promote farmer-producer organizations, encourage crop diversification, and improve productivity in agriculture through support for mechanization and the creation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) scheme has provided income support to farmers, leading to diversification in sources of farmers' income and improving their resilience to weather shocks. The National Food Security Act (NFSA) has been implemented to provide food security, with 81.4 crore beneficiaries receiving free foodgrains for one year from January 1, 2023. The government has also taken initiatives to enhance credit availability, facilitate mechanization, and boost horticulture and organic farming. The animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries sectors have been recognized as emerging sectors, with the government providing support for their development. The chapter discusses various policy initiatives, including the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure returns over the cost of production, and the Interest Subvention Scheme (ISS) to provide short-term credit to farmers at subsidized interest rates. The Kisan Credit Card Scheme (KCC) has been introduced to provide hassle-free credit availability to farmers, with 3.89 crore KCCs issued as of December 30, 2022. The government has also promoted organic farming, with 44.3 lakh organic farmers and 59.1 lakh hectares of area brought under organic farming by 2021-22. The chapter highlights the importance of the agriculture sector in India's growth and development, with a focus on sustainable and inclusive development.\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Other Important Initiatives in Agriculture\n\n## other Important Initiatives in Agriculture\n\n8.12 PM KISAN Scheme: It is a Central Sector Scheme to supplement the financial needs of land-holding  farmers. The  financial  benefit  of    ₹6,000  per  year  is  transferred  into  the  bank accounts of farmer families through DBT. It is one of the largest DBT schemes in the world. About 11.3 crore farmers were covered under the Scheme in its April-July 2022-23 payment cycle. The Scheme, through a span of over 3 years, has successfully provided assistance of more than Rs. 2 lakh crore to crores of needy farmers. Many studies and findings indicate that the PM KISAN scheme has helped farmers towards productive investment in agricultural activities. This, through a multiplier effect, has contributed to the overall improvement of the farm sector. For instance, in an empirical 2 study  with the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), the  International  Food  Policy  Research Institute  (IFPRI)  found  that  the  scheme  has  enabled addressing the liquidity constraints of farmers for buying agricultural inputs. Further, for the small and marginal farmers, it has helped them meet their requirement of funds for farm inputs and their daily consumption, education, health and other incidental expenses.\n\n8. 13 Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF): AIF is a financing facility operational from the year 2020-21 to 2032-33 for the creation of post-harvest management infrastructure and community farm assets, with benefits including 3 per cent interest subvention and credit guarantee support. Under this, a provision of ₹1 lakh crore for 2020-21 to 2025-26 has been made, and interest\n\n2 Varshney, Deepak; Joshi, Pramod Kumar; Roy, Devesh; and Kumar, Anjani. 2020.

AIF scheme has the facility of convergence with any other scheme of the State or Central Government and can prove to be a milestone in investment in the agriculture sector.\n\nSince its inception, an amount of ₹13,681 crore has been sanctioned for agriculture infrastructure in  the  country,  covering  more  than  18,133  projects. These  include  8,076  warehouses,  2,788 primary processing units, 1,860 custom hiring centres, 937 sorting &amp; grading units, 696 cold store  projects,  163  assaying  units  and  around  3613  other  kinds  of  post-harvest  management projects and community farming assets.\n\n8.14  Pradhan  Mantri  Fasal  Bima  Yojana  (PMFBY):  PMFBY  is  currently  the  largest  crop insurance scheme in the world in terms of farmer enrolments, averaging 5.5 crore applications every year and the third largest in terms of the premium received. The scheme promises minimal financial burden on the farmer, with farmers paying only 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent of the total premium for the Rabi and Kharif seasons, respectively, with Centre and State Governments bearing most of the premium cost. During the last six years of its implementation, farmers paid a premium of ₹25,186 crore and received claims amounting to ₹1.2 lakh crore (as of 31 October 2022). The acceptability of the scheme amongst the farmer can be ascertained from the fact that the share of non-loanee, marginalised, and small farmers have increased by 282 per cent since the scheme's inception in 2016.\n\n## Box VIII.1: Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima yojana (PMFBy)\n\n- PMFBY was launched in the 2016 Kharif season to provide comprehensive insurance coverage to farmers in case of crop failure, helping stabilise their incomes. The scheme is implemented through empanelled general insurance companies. It is modified/revamped on a timely basis considering the prevailing policy regime and requirement of policy intervention in crop insurance in the country. The Scheme covers all Food &amp; Oilseeds crops and Annual Commercial/Horticultural  Crops  for  which  past  yield  data  is  available  and  for  which  the requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) are being conducted under the General Crop Estimation Survey (GCES). The revamped Scheme w.e.f Kharif 2020 has many features, which include voluntary participation for all farmers, selection of Insurance Companies by the States for 3 years in a go, a two-step process of crop yield estimation, use of smart sampling technique through satellite data for crop cutting experiments, etc.\n- The scheme is implemented on an 'Area Approach' basis. Admissible claims are worked out  and  paid  directly  to  the  insured  farmer's  account  by  the  insurance  companies  on  the yield data based on the requisite number of CCEs per unit area furnished to the concerned insurance. However, losses due to localised risks of hailstorms, landslides, inundation, etc., are calculated on an individual-insured farm basis. These claims are assessed by a joint committee comprising representatives of the State Government and concerned insurance companies.\n\n- PMFBY is currently the largest crop insurance scheme in the world in terms of farmer enrolments,  averaging  5.5  crore  applications  every  year  and  the  third  largest  in  terms  of premiums received. In the last six years of its implementation, farmers have paid a premium of ₹25,186 crore and received claims amounting to ₹1.26 lakh crore (as of 31st October 2022). The increase in acceptability of the scheme amongst the farmer can be ascertained from the fact that the share of non-loanee, marginalised and small farmers increased by 282 per cent since the scheme's inception in 2016. During the arduous seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019 marred by weather extremities, the scheme proved to be a decisive factor in securing the livelihoods of farmers, wherein the claims paid ratio in several states averaged more than 100 per cent against the gross premium collected. For example, the States of Chhattisgarh (2017), Odisha (2017), Tamil Nadu (2018), and Jharkhand (2019) received 384 per cent, 222 per cent, 163 per cent and 159 per cent of claims ratio against a gross premium.\n- To better resolve grievances within the scheme, National Crop Insurance Portal has been developed to handle all grievances from end to end. This portal is equipped with the necessary features, such as Complaint/Query capturing through multiple modes, farmer authentication &amp; online  ticket  forwarding  to  the  concerned  company,  online  escalation  as  per  escalation matrices, updating of resolution details, MIS &amp; Dashboards for data analysis. It has API-based connectivity to the insurance companies and is well-designed, ensuring that every grievance is taken to a logical conclusion to the farmer's satisfaction. Along with this, the redressal of complaints within the prescribed time limits is monitored through the portal by the concerned State  and  Central  Government  officials.  The  Beta  version  of  the  portal  was  launched  in Chhattisgarh on 21st July 2022.\n- Further, a provision of Stratified Grievance Redressal Mechanism, viz. District Level Grievance  Redressal  Committee  (DGRC),  State  Level  Grievance  Redressal  Committee (SGRC) has been made in the Revised Operational Guidelines of the Scheme to resolve such complaints.\n- 8.15  Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH): Several expert groups have identified horticulture as a high-growth area and a source of buoyant income and improved resilience for farmers. The scheme to promote horticulture covering fruits, vegetables, root and tuber crops, spices, flowers, plantation crops etc., was introduced in 2014-15. The interventions include introducing improved varieties and quality seeds, incentives for plantation crops, cluster development, and post-harvest management. According to third advance estimates (2021-22), a record production of 342.3 million tonnes in an area of 28.0 million hectares was achieved. The government has identified 55 horticulture clusters, of which 12 have been selected for the Cluster Development Programme (CDP) pilot phase. This programme is designed to leverage the geographical specialisation of horticulture clusters and promote integrated and market-led development  of  pre-production,  production  and  post-harvest  activities,  including  the  entire supply chain.\n- 8.16  National  Agriculture  Market  (e-NAM)  Scheme:  The  Government  of  India  launched the  National Agriculture  Market  (e-NAM)  Scheme  in  2016  to  create  an  online  transparent, competitive bidding system to ensure farmers get remunerative prices for their produce. Under\n\nthe e-NAM Scheme, the Government provides free software and assistance of ₹75 lakh per APMC mandi for related hardware, including quality assaying equipment and the creation of infrastructure like cleaning, grading, sorting, packaging, compost unit, etc. As on 31 December 2022, more than 1.7 crore farmers and 2.3 lakh traders have been registered on e-NAM portal\n\n8.17  Climate-Smart Farming Practices: This is slowly gaining acceptance with farmers using clean energy sources like solar for irrigation. The farmers have been incentivised to transfer electricity generated through solar to the local grid. Crop yield prediction models using artificial intelligence and drones for monitoring soil and crop health have been initiated. Smart farming also enables crop diversification, which will help farmers reduce their dependence on monsoons for water. There are over 1,000 agritech start-ups in India. These assist farmers in improving farming techniques  3 .\n\n## Box VIII.2: International year of the Millets: our traditional staple and a healthier alternative\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Farmers Welfare\n\nThe United Nations General Assembly, in its 75th session during March 2021, declared 2023 the International Year of Millets (IYM). Millets are Smart Food with high nutritional value, are  climate  resilient,  and  align  with  several  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs). These are also important by virtue of their mammoth potential to generate livelihood, increase farmers' income and ensure food &amp; nutritional security all over the world.\n\n3 www.investindia.gov.in/team-india-blogs/digitalization-agriculture-india\n\nIndia produces more than 50.9 million tonnes (as per fourth advance estimate) of millet which accounts for 80 per cent of Asia's and 20 per cent of global production. The global average yield is 1229 kg/ha, whereas India has a higher average yield of 1239 kg/ha. In India, millets are  primarily  a  Kharif  crop  mostly  grown  in  rainfed  conditions,  requiring  less  water  and agricultural inputs than other staple crops.\n\nGiven the nutritional value of the millets, the Government notified Millets as Nutri-cereals in April 2018. Under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM), millets have been introduced to  provide  nutritional  support. A  sub-mission  on  Nutri-cereals  is  being  implemented  since 2018-19 in 212 districts of 14 States.\n\nIndia  has  more  than  500  start-ups  working  in  the  millet  value  chains,  while  the  Indian Institute  of  Millets  Research  has  incubated  250  start-ups  under  Rashtriya  Krishi  Vikas Yojana - Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sectors Rejuvenation (RKVYRAFTAAR).",
