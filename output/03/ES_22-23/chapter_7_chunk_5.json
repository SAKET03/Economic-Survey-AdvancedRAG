See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"Climate change is primarily attributed to disproportionately high cumulative emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from developed countries. India has contributed only about 4% to cumulative global emissions and maintains its per capita emission at far less than the world average. Despite being less responsible for emissions, India is committed to a low-emission growth pathway with a net-zero emissions goal by 2070.\\n\\nIndia has integrated development goals with ambitious climate action goals, including increasing solar power capacity, energy saving targets, and improving green cover. The country has achieved its target of 40% installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuels ahead of 2030 and has advanced the target to 50%. The National Hydrogen Mission and Green Hydrogen Policy have been introduced to enable India to be energy independent by 2047.\\n\\nThe country has updated its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in line with the Prime Minister's vision, focusing on sustainable lifestyles and climate justice. India aims to reduce its emissions intensity by 45% by 2030 and achieve about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources.\\n\\nIndia's climate actions have been largely financed from domestic sources, but the country needs tens of trillions of US dollars to achieve its climate goals. The government has scaled up efforts to mobilize private capital, including through sovereign green bonds. A framework for green bonds has been issued, complying with International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles.\\n\\nThe country's climate vision is linked to its development goals, including poverty eradication and basic well-being for all citizens. India launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008, establishing eight National Missions. The country has made significant progress on these missions, including increasing solar power capacity and improving energy efficiency.\\n\\nIndia's updated NDC includes eight goals, three of which are quantitative targets to be achieved by 2030. The targets include cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources reaching 40%, reduction in emissions intensity of GDP by 33-35%, and creation of additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.\\n\\nThe country aims to create an additional carbon sink of 2.5-3 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. India's forest and tree cover have shown a steady increase, with a carbon stock of 7,204 million tonnes in 2019. The country has 75 Ramsar sites covering 13.3 lakh ha and has increased its mangrove cover by 364 sq. km.\\n\\nIndia has implemented various measures to conserve and protect the environment, including the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, and the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. The country has also launched initiatives such as Project Cheetah, the world's first intercontinental large wild carnivore translocation project.\\n\\nIndia has committed to mitigating pollution caused by littered single-use plastics and has banned the manufacture, import, and use of identified single-use plastic items. The country has also notified guidelines on Extended Producer Responsibility for plastic packaging and has implemented the Plastic Waste Management Amendment Rules, 2021.\\n\\nThe government has published the Battery Waste Management Rules, 2022, and the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2022, to ensure environmentally sound management of waste batteries and e-waste. India aims to promote a circular economy, reduce plastic footprint, and develop new alternatives to plastic packaging.\\n\\nThe country has made significant progress on its climate goals, including enhancing its non-fossil fuel-based installed capacity target to 50%. India has also evolved its sustainable finance framework, extending the requirement to 1,000 top listed companies on a mandatory basis. The country needs to dedicate resources to climate change, in addition to its development goals. Obligations on climate should be matched with on-time availability of climate finance, technology, and inputs like critical minerals.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Major Decisions at COP 27\n\n## major decisions at CoP 27\n\n7.56  The COP 27 to the UNFCCC was held from 6 to 20 November 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. In conjunction with COP 27, the 17 th Session of the Conference of Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP17), the 4th Session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of Parties to Paris Agreement (CMA4), 57th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) were also held.\n\n- 7.57  India participated in COP 27, with a focus on mainstreaming the theme of LiFE - Lifestyle for Environment. The Indian Pavilion at COP 27 highlighted the theme of LiFE in various ways - models, audio-visual displays, activities, and 49 side events. India invited all countries to join the LiFE movement, which is a pro-people and pro-planet effort seeking to shift the world from mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation of natural resources.\n- 7.58  The cover decision of COP 27, titled the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, notes the 'importance of the transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production for efforts to address climate change'. Other decisions were setting up the Just Transition and Mitigation Work Program and the agreement on Joint work on the implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security to be conducted over four years.\n- 7.59  During COP 27, developing nations strongly voiced setting up a separate fund for loss and damage. After negotiations, it was decided to establish new funding arrangements for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to loss and damage, with a focus on addressing loss and damage. A transitional committee has been established to work out the modalities.\n\n13 Beloskar, V. D., &amp; Rao, S. V. D. (2022). Did ESG Save the Day? Evidence from India During the Covid-19 Crisis.

Global Business Review, 23(6), 1336-1352.\n\n7.60  Other  substantive  elements  covered  in  the  Sharm  el-Sheikh  Implementation  Plan  are the importance of science in guiding climate action, doubling adaptation finance, dialogue on making finance flows consistent with low-emissions, and climate-resilient development calls on  Multilateral  Development  Banks  (MDB)  reform  for  delivering  climate  finance  at  scale; diversity of sources of finance (including new and additional finance), etc. COP 27 also saw progress on adaptation, with governments agreeing on how to move forward on the Global Goal on Adaptation, which will conclude at COP 28 and inform the first Global Stocktake in 2023.\n\n7.61  Lastly, during COP 27, it was also recognised that the target of US$ 100 billion per year is yet to be achieved. The COP 21 decided that, prior to 2025, a New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance from a floor of US$ 100 billion per year, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries, shall be set. To further the agenda of setting the NCQG by 2024, COP 27 decided that Four Technical Expert Dialogues (TEDs) will be carried out prior to COP 28.",
