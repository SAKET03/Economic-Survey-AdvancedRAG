The  following  section  explores  in  detail  how  the services sector secures its financing.\n\n## Bank credit\n\n11.15 FY24 witnessed an upward trajectory of credit inflow in the services sector, with YoY growth rates surpassing the 20 per cent mark each month since April 2023. The financial year ended with an outstanding services sector credit of ₹45.9 lakh crore in March 2024, with a YoY growth of 22.9 per cent. 10\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt; Source: RBI Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy (Table No.170- Deployment of Bank Credit by Major Sectors)\n\n9    World Trade Organization.

The aviation sector experienced the most significant credit inflow YoY growth of 56 per cent, attributed to increased aircraft leasing, hiring and a positive medium to long-term growth outlook.\n\n## External Financing\n\n11.17 The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has published the World Investment Report 2024 (WIR 2024) and has ranked India 15 th  in terms of FDI inflow (top 20 host economies) for the year 2023. As per the WIR 2024, India is the 2 nd  largest host country in terms of number of international project finance deals and 4 th  largest in terms of number of Greenfield project announcements. 11\n\n11.18 FY24 witnessed a decline in the FDI equity inflows to the services sector (Chart XI.9), as in the case of the overall FDI equity inflows to India. Higher interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, heightened global uncertainties and rising protectionism that favour domestic sourcing have all contributed to lower FDI inflows into the sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt; Source: Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) Publication- Quarterly FDI Statistics Note: (i) The services sector includes Financial, Banking, Insurance, Non-Financial / Business, Outsourcing, R&amp;D, Courier, Tech.
