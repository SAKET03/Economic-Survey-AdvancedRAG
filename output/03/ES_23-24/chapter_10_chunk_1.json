per  cent. 1   Among  the  four  sub-sectors  of  industry,  manufacturing  and  construction achieved close to double-digit growth, while mining &amp; quarrying and electricity &amp; water supply also  recorded  strong  positive  growth  in  FY24.  This  reflects  the  broad-based  acceleration  of\n\n1     As per the provisional estimates of GDP released by the Central Statistics Office on 30 May 2024. This is greater than the 9 per cent industrial growth estimated in the second advance estimates of GDP released in February 2024, indicating faster than anticipated expansion of industrial output during the latter part of FY24.\n\nindustrial output. The HSBC India Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing also consistently remained well above the threshold value of 50 in all months of FY24, indicating sustained expansion and stability in India's manufacturing sector.\n\n10.2 The share of manufacturing in total gross value added at current prices was 14.3 per cent in FY23.  However, the output share is 35.2 per cent during the same period, indicating that the sector has significant backward and forward linkages that are not fully captured within its value-added share. About 47.5 per cent of the total value of output in the country is used as inputs in productive activities (inter-industry consumption) 2 . Manufacturing activities account for about 50 per cent of the inter-industry consumption and, at the same time, supply almost 50 per cent of inputs used in all productive activities (agriculture, industry and services).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10.3 Despite the pandemic and consequent impairment of manufacturing value chains, the manufacturing sector achieved an average annual growth rate of 5.2 per cent in the last decade. The manufacturing sub-sectors witnessed considerable realignment in output shares in the last decade. Catalysts of manufacturing growth in the last decade included chemicals, wood products and furniture, transport equipment, pharmaceuticals and machinery and equipment. Out of them, the expansion of steel, machinery and equipment, wood products, and transport equipment signifies a thrust on capital formation in the economy, especially in the public sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Survey calculations based on National Account Statistics 2024 (Statement 8.6.1 &amp; 8.6.2), MoSPI Note: *excludes electrical, electronic, computer and transport equipment\n\n10.4 India's industrialisation was held in check by the absence of physical infrastructure and logistics as well as intrusive and cumbersome licensing requirements on capacity creation and expansion. Further, the manufacture of specific items was reserved for the small-scale sector. Much of these restrictions have been now lifted, and physical infrastructure is being created at a rapid pace. Connectivity has improved. The Goods and Services Tax has created a single market for several commodities, enabling manufacturing at scale. However, India faces stiff challenges in growing its manufacturing base. Public policy must do whatever it can to boost competitiveness.  Action  lies  predominantly  in  deregulation.  The  private  sector  must  think long-term and invest in quality through R&amp;D spending. These may not be sufficient, but they are  necessary conditions for the growth of the sector. Manufacturing still has the ability to generate low and semi-skilled jobs and bring development closer to the people. India needs to prioritise the sector.\n\n10.5 The remaining sections of the Chapter are organised in the following way. The next section examines progress, challenges and policy initiatives in different industrial segments, such as key industrial intermediates and consumer-oriented industries 3 . This is followed by a brief discussion on cross-cutting themes like production-linked incentives (PLIs), micro, small\n\n3  Fertiliser is covered in chapter 9 on Agriculture and Food Management\n\nand medium enterprises (MSMEs), central public sector undertakings (CPSEs) and industrial R&amp;D and innovation. The final section concludes the discussions and provides a wayforward.",
