Its post-pandemic dynamics, particularly the trends and patterns that emerged and solidified during FY24, indicate an ongoing transformation in domestic service delivery systems and their demands. Aided by the focus on policy and procedural reforms, physical infrastructure and logistics, all significant business, personal, financial and infrastructure-based services have emerged strongly from the pandemic.  However,  the  transformation  lies  in  the  fast-paced  shift  towards  digital services like online payments, e-commerce, and entertainment platforms, as well as the increase in the demand for high-tech services as inputs in other productive activities. India's young and tech-savvy population offers an opportunity to enhance the country's vocational and educational ecosystem further. This will equip the labour force with the required digital and high-tech skills in a time-bound manner, helping India reap the full dividends of these opportunities.",
