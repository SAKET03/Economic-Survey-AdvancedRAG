Despite the Indian rupee depreciating by around 3% annually between 1993 and 2024, the economy has achieved this growth without a significant rise in overall indebtedness. India's per capita current dollar GDP has increased from $301.5 in 1993 to $2,484.8 in 2023, indicating a substantial improvement in the standard of living.\\n\\nThe government aims to make India a developed nation by 2047, and the economy can grow at a rate of 7% plus on a sustained basis if structural reforms are built upon. A six-pronged growth strategy is proposed to achieve this goal, focusing on generating productive employment, addressing the skill gap challenge, tapping the full potential of the agriculture sector, easing compliance requirements and financing bottlenecks for MSMEs, managing India's green transition, and deepening the corporate bond market.\\n\\nThe global backdrop is complex, with rising geopolitical conflicts, a clash of priorities between globalist elites and nationalists, and a crisis posed by climate change and global warming. India faces several challenges, including sustaining economic growth, maintaining a constant vigil on its borders, and dealing with cybersecurity threats. The economy needs to generate domestic resources for investment and growth priorities, and geopolitics imposes a ceiling on external deficit and external financing.\\n\\nThe medium-term growth outlook for the Indian economy is premised on key tenets, including increasing geoeconomic fragmentation, a global trust deficit, and the integration of climate change strategies into national development policy and planning. The chapter identifies key areas of policy focus, including generating productive employment, addressing the skill gap challenge, and managing India's green transition.\\n\\nIndia's workforce is estimated to be nearly 56.5 crore, with 45% employed in agriculture, 11.4% in manufacturing, 28.9% in services, and 13% in construction. The services sector remains a major job creator, but the construction sector has been rising in prominence. The manufacturing sector employment creation has been subdued in the past decade but appears to have rebounded since 2021-22.\\n\\nThe skill gap challenge is significant, with 65% of India's population under 35, and many lacking the skills needed by a modern economy. Only 51.25% of youth are deemed employable, and there is a need to create avenues for the labor force leaving agriculture. The agriculture sector continues to face structural issues, including sustaining agriculture growth without letting food price inflation rise beyond acceptable limits.\\n\\nMSMEs have played a key role in defining the economic trajectory of major economies, but the sector continues to face extensive regulation and compliance requirements and significant bottlenecks with access to affordable and timely funding. India has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 33-35% from 2005 levels by 2030 and enhancing forest cover to absorb 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.\\n\\nThe government has launched several schemes aimed at providing affordable credit to MSMEs, including the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises. The Lok Sabha Standing Committee on Finance estimated that the credit gap in the MSME sector is around Rs 20-25 lakh crore.\\n\\nIndia's economic growth story over the last decade has been one of resilience, weathering multiple global crises through deft government handling. The structural reforms undertaken by the government have put the economy firmly on a growth path, and India is set to become the third-largest economy in the world. The IMF has raised India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.8% from 6.5% on the back of strong domestic demand and a rising working-age population.\\n\\nThe government has been following a policy of continuity and change as India progresses towards the collective goal of Viksit Bharat @2047. The prime minister has emphasized the need for everyone's effort to achieve this goal, and the growth strategy presented in the chapter seeks to build on policy initiatives undertaken since 2014. The economy can grow at or above 7% on a sustained basis if structural reforms are built upon, and the government aims to sustain growth for nearly a generation up to 2047 or more.The Indian economy has made significant strides in delivering crucial infrastructure and implementing direct benefit schemes aimed at enhancing citizens' well-being. The civil service has been at the heart of these transformative efforts, designing policies and ensuring initiatives reach all citizens. However, sustaining and accelerating India's progress requires the state machinery to reimagine, reinvent, reinvigorate, and re-equip itself.\\n\\nThe government has made a significant beginning in lateral entry into senior ranks of Central Ministries through a transparent process. This needs to be substantially expanded to plug the gap in diverse skills and mindsets. Foundational and mid-career training for civil servants in all specialties has to be re-imagined for recharging and rebooting skills, aptitude, and attitudes.\\n\\nMission Karmayogi aims to enhance state capacity using the 'Workforce-Work-Workplace' framework to address each level of the civil service and linkages between them. It provides a multi-pronged solution encompassing building the capacity of the workforce, improving the quality of work, and enhancing the workplace.\\n\\nThe program endeavors to enhance state capacity by connecting workplace roles and workers' competencies. Competencies are the attitudes, skills, and knowledge essential for a civil servant to perform their role successfully. The Karmayogi Competency Model is a public human resource management framework developed by the Capacity Building Commission of India.\\n\\nThe model is built on four elements: self-awareness, collaboration and inclusion, transparency and compliance, and citizen-centricity. Competencies then become a key tool for enhancing the performance of civil servants. Capacity-building programs can be designed to build specific competencies that a civil servant needs to perform their role well.\\n\\nMission Karmayogi is also introducing a role-based human resource management system to match civil servants with roles based on competencies. Decision-making around postings, transfers, and promotions can then be guided by civil servants' demonstrated competencies and experience.\\n\\nThe Indian economy grew at 7% in 2023-24, with a growth rate of 7.3% in the second half of the year. The manufacturing sector grew at 8.1% in 2023-24, driven by a growth of 9.1% in the second half of the year. The services sector grew at 7.1% in 2023-24, with a growth rate of 7.4% in the second half of the year.\\n\\nThe inflation rate averaged around 5% in 2023-24, with a peak of 5.4% in March 2024. The current account deficit narrowed to 1.2% of GDP in 2023-24 from 2.4% in 2022-23. The fiscal deficit declined to 5.2% of GDP in 2023-24 from 6.4% in 2022-23.\\n\\nThe Indian government announced several policy measures to support economic growth, including a cut in the corporate tax rate and a hike in the import duty on certain electronics components. The government also announced a plan to privatize several state-owned enterprises, including banks and insurance companies.\\n\\nThe Indian economy is expected to grow at 7.2% in 2024-25, driven by a growth rate of 7.5% in the manufacturing sector and 7.2% in the services sector. The inflation rate is expected to average around 4.5% in 2024-25.\\n\\nThe government aims to achieve a growth rate of 8-9% in the next few years, driven by investments in infrastructure and a growth in the manufacturing sector. The government also aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26.\\n\\nThe Indian economy has the potential to grow at 7-8% in the long term, driven by a growth in the manufacturing sector and a rise in private sector investment. The government needs to implement policy measures to support economic growth, including investments in infrastructure and a growth in the manufacturing sector.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Setting the Context\n\n## SETTING THE CONTEXT\n\n- 5.1. In 1993, the Indian economy was valued at less than USD300 billion in dollar terms at current prices. Fast forward to 2024, and it is estimated to have reached a staggering USD 3.6 trillion. This represents a remarkable 12-fold increase despite the Indian rupee depreciating by around 3 per cent annually between 1993 and 2024. Moreover, this has been achieved without a  big  rise  in  the  country's  overall  indebtedness,  indicating an efficient utilisation of capital. India's per capita current dollar GDP has increased from 301.5 in 1993 to 2,484.8 in 2023, 1 which indicates a substantial improvement in the standard of living.\n- 5.2. India is a historical and long civilisation. It provided answers to many questions that humankind faced and still faces. It is a country with a big land mass and a huge population. It rightly aspires to be reckoned with as a great power in economic and other terms. China, India's neighbour to the Northeast and a nation of comparable size and population and antiquity of civilisation as India, has grown to become a major global economic and political power in less than a generation. India, too, has now set for itself the goal of becoming a developed nation within a generation by 2047, the hundredth year of independence.\n\n1  World Bank, 2023 (https://tinyurl.com/yeksmbde)\n\n- 5.3. Today, the world faces several major fault lines. We have arrived at a multipolar world. It is more difficult than the bipolar world that we were used to for nearly five decades after the War ended. Therefore, mini and significant geopolitical conflicts are likely in the coming decades.\n- 5.4. At  a  cultural  level,  the  rise  of  what  is  called  the  'Far  Right'  by  mainstream  media  in advanced nations is, in effect, a clash of priorities between globalist elites and others whose fortunes are bound by and tied to their national geographies. This clash of priorities transcends economics.  It  includes  cultural  and  social  preferences  and  values.  Therefore,  along  with economic stagnation and geopolitical conflicts, societies  in  advanced  nations  are  fracturing from within, too. The literature analysing long political, social, and civilisational cycles has warned us of a fairly to severely turbulent three decades until the middle of the century.\n- 5.5. The idea of economic globalisation has run its course. It may not be reversed fully, but it  has peaked. It will continue to face obstacles as economic policies worldwide pivot to the promotion of national champions for reasons too well-known to bear repetition here. Along with the peaking of globalisation, there is also a rethinking of the role of government in national economic  strategy  as  inequality,  poverty,  and  indebtedness  have  become  pressing  issues in  the  aftermath  of  the  Covid  pandemic.  The  clamour  for  easy  answers  to  these  global  and generational challenges has provided an excuse for interventionist policies despite their poor empirical record in achieving prosperous or more equal societies.\n- 5.6. Lastly,  there  is  the  crisis  posed  by  climate  change  and  global  warming.  Developed countries are pushing for a reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. With their policies having questionable effectiveness in achieving emission reduction in their own countries, they are ramping up pressure on developing nations. Developing nations are struggling to restore economic growth and reduce poverty and debt in their countries, all of which have been amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. They lack both technology and financial resources to undertake the necessary transition to cleaner fuels. Developed nations are generous with pledges and parsimonious in delivering on them. Further, there are huge uncertainties as to the efficacy of drastic measures to combat climate change and their economic impact over the next half to a full decade. Slower growth, stagnation, or outright contraction might trigger social unrest and exodus of people to the West.\n- 5.7. This is the global backdrop to India's growth, prosperity, and superpower aspirations for the next quarter century. In contrast, during its rise, China did not face many of these challenges, and even the ones they faced were fairly milder, in comparison. For realising India's aspirations, despite the changed circumstances, a good place to start is to acknowledge and recognise that the terrain has changed to be able to traverse through it and reach the destination.\n- 5.8. India has to sustain its economic growth rate over a quarter century and do it sustainably, keeping the environment and climate in mind. Water stress looms large, as does air pollution. Life expectancy, much higher now than in the past, has stagnated in recent years. It has to educate and skill its youth to stay ahead of the curve so that they can work with emerging technologies while overcoming the accumulated education and skill deficits, accentuated by the pandemic, that make it harder to raise productivity even with the current state of technological\n\nprogress. It is required to maintain a constant vigil on its borders both in the Northwest and in the Northeast. With the digitalisation of the Indian economy, cybersecurity assumes a much higher degree of importance and urgency. Therefore, providing financial resources for national security is imperative. Fiscal resources have to increase without compromising on economic growth.\n\n- 5.9. The capacity in terms of numbers and the capability of the State in terms of competence, skills,  and  attitude  are  additional  factors  that  would  determine  the  outcomes  of  India's economic and social goals. Economic policies have to be crafted in such a manner that they do not address issues narrowly or incompletely while rendering problems in other areas more intractable. Goals for a higher share of renewable power with its implications for land usage and dependence on inimical powers for resources are one example. The impact of farm sector policies on water security is another example.\n\n5.10.  With the global backdrop described earlier likely to come in the way of India boosting its exports at the same pace and level as East Asian countries and national security considerations likely  to  make  foreign  direct  investment  flows  volatile  year-to-year,  India  has  to  generate domestic resources mostly for its own investment and growth priorities. Geopolitics imposes its ceiling on external deficit and, consequently, external financing.\n\n5.11. Against  this  background,  the  medium-term  growth  outlook  for  the  Indian  economy, which will be detailed in this chapter, is premised on the following key tenets:\n\n-  First, increasing geoeconomic  fragmentation  and  the  consequent  resource nationalism have significant growth-limiting impacts on countries. It has given rise  to  a  trade-off  between  efficiency  and  resilience  that  did  not  exist  a  decade  earlier. Ensuring the security of supply through building buffers and slack has replaced the ability to operate at the frontiers of efficiency. 'Just in case' has replaced 'Just in time'.\n-  Second, a global trust deficit is driving countries to pursue policies focused on enabling them to become self-reliant and protect  them  from  external  shocks, especially in sectors of strategic importance. Therefore, the balance between inward-looking policies versus outward-looking policies needs to become more nuanced going forward;\n-  Third, the integration of climate change strategies into national development policy and planning is not merely an environmental imperative but more, as it  impacts socio-economic stability, public health, banking, and public finances. Climate change imposes costs and requires policymakers to balance adaptation to climate change and  emission  mitigation.  It  also  necessitates  a  trade-off  between  energy  security  and economic development on the one hand and energy transition on the other.\n-  Fourth, for better and worse, technology is emerging as the biggest strategic differentiator determining  the  economic  prosperity of nations. Its productivityenhancing potential is beyond doubt, but the social impact of emerging technologies such as  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  via  labour  market  disruptions  and  labour  displacement  is barely understood. It also has the potential to skew the capital and labour shares of income in favour of the former.\n\n-  Fifth, countries across the board have limited policy space to manoeuvre , given the multiple crises confronting the global economy. Therefore, recognition and acceptance of trade-offs have become more necessary than before for policymakers.\n-  Sixth ,  in  the  last  decade  (2014-2024),  the  Government of India has pursued big-ticket reforms focused on restoring the health of the economy, elevating the potential growth by relieving supply-side constraints and strengthening its capabilities, capable of fulfilling the growth aspirations of the people in the present and the Amrit Kaal. The next stage is  to  ensure  that  these  reforms  are  implemented  correctly  and  this  will  require  intense engagement with state governments, the private sector, and civil society. Going forward, the Government's focus must turn to bottom-up reform and the strengthening of the plumbing of governance so that the structural reforms of the last decade yield strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.",
