The capital expenditure of the government has seen an almost three-fold increase in FY24 relative to FY20 levels, with major beneficiaries being key foundational assets like roads and railways.\\n\\nThe government has also implemented institutional and procedural reforms to facilitate project execution and timely issue resolutions, including initiatives to enhance private sector participation through PPPs, and measures like National Infrastructure Pipeline and Project Monitoring Group. The chapter highlights that with increased public investment over the last five years, India has witnessed significant expansion in physical and digital connectivity and social infrastructure.\\n\\nThe creation of resilient, world-class infrastructure is a key plank of India's policy strategy to become Viksit Bharat @2047. The chapter examines recent developments in India's infrastructure space, with a special focus on progress achieved in FY24. The chapter is divided into six sections, investigating infrastructure financing, sectoral developments, challenges, and outlook.\\n\\nInfrastructure financing in India still relies heavily on capital expenditure by the Union and State Governments. Despite financial innovations, public expenditure continues to play a central role in funding large-scale infrastructure projects. The capital expenditure of the Union Government increased by 2.2 times from FY21 to FY24, while that of State governments increased by 2.1 times during the same period.\\n\\nThe share of gross budgetary support to two key connectivity segments, Railways and National Highway Authority of India, in the total capital expenditure of the Union Government increased from 36.4% in FY21 to 42.9% in FY24. The aggregate investible resources of CPSEs, consisting of GBS and resources raised by CPSEs, have been optimized to reduce borrowing costs.\\n\\nThe net flow of funds to infrastructure sectors through bank credit between March 2023 to March 2024 was around ₹79,000 crore. The credit growth to infrastructure sectors in FY24 recovered to 6.5%, as against the growth of 2.3% in FY23. The gross inflow of external commercial borrowings to infrastructure sectors picked up to USD 9.05 billion in FY24.\\n\\nThe resource mobilization by infrastructure sectors through debt and equity issuances in the capital market was just over ₹1,00,000 crore during FY24. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have raised ₹18,840 crore from 2019 to 2024, while Infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) raised a total of ₹1,11,294 crore in the last five years.\\n\\nThe National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) was announced in August 2021, with an aggregate monetization potential of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years. During the first two years, transactions aggregating to about ₹2.3 lakh crore in accruals or private investments were completed under the core asset monetization program.\\n\\nThe development of expressways and corridors, along with transformative initiatives, has been the highlight of the recent road sector growth journey. The Bharatmala Pariyojana has significantly expanded the national highway network, increasing the length of high-speed corridors by 12 times and 4-lane roads by 2.6 times between 2014 and 2024.\\n\\nThe average pace of NH construction increased by ~3 times from 11.7 km per day in FY14 to ~34 km per day by FY24. The Indian Railways' capital expenditure increased by 77% over the past 5 years, with significant investments in new lines, gauge conversion, and doubling.\\n\\nThe power transmission system in India is connected into one grid running on one frequency, with an inter-regional capability of transferring 1,18,740 megawatts. The peak electricity demand increased by 13% to 243 GW in FY24. The renewable energy sector received approximately USD 17.88 billion as FDI from April 2000 until March 2024.\\n\\nThe Jal Jeevan Mission was launched in August 2019 to provide a tap water connection to every rural household by 2024 with a total outlay of ₹3.6 lakh crore. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) was launched in 2015 to provide pucca houses with basic amenities to all eligible beneficiaries in urban areas.\\n\\nThe Smart Cities Mission was launched in June 2015 to promote cities that provide core infrastructure, clean and sustainable environment, and give a decent quality of life to their citizens. The Swachh Bharat Mission Urban focuses on ensuring every citizen, including the poor household of urban India, has access to sanitation facilities.\\n\\nThe tourism sector has seen significant growth, with 29 new sites identified for development under the PRASHAD scheme. The Indian space sector has seen remarkable progress, with 55 active space assets, including 18 communication satellites and 20 Earth Observation satellites.\\n\\nThe digital infrastructure in India has been improving, with the usage and underlying technologies of telecommunications undergoing massive changes. The Government has introduced guidelines for the Spectrum Regulatory Sandbox to foster innovation and enhance ease of doing business in the telecommunications sector.\\n\\nThe electronics and information technology sector has seen significant growth, with the Government envisioning the India AI program as a mission-centric approach for leveraging transformative technologies. The India AI program aims to democratize access to AI innovation pillars and ensure global competitiveness of India's AI ecosystem.\\n\\nThe chapter highlights several challenges, including land-related issues, skill demands, need to improve private participation, climate and environmental sustainability, and lack of aggregation of financial flows into infrastructure. The government has launched several initiatives to address these challenges, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline, Project Monitoring Group, and PM GatiShakti National Master Plan.\\n\\nThe National Logistics Policy was launched in September 2022 to complement PMGS-NMP, aiming to drive business competitiveness through an integrated, efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective logistics network. The policy aims to reduce the cost of logistics, improve the Logistics Performance Index ranking, and create a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem.\\n\\nOverall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in India's infrastructure space, highlighting the progress achieved in FY24, and the challenges and opportunities ahead.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n12.1.  Creation of resilient, world-class infrastructure-physical, social, financial and digital-is a key plank of India's policy strategy to become ViksitBharat @ 2047. However, recent studies by the Asian Development Bank 1  and the World Bank 2  and recent estimates made by agencies like CRISIL 3 have identified gaps in infrastructure investment in different sectors. Against this background, this  chapter  examines  the  recent  developments  in  India's  infrastructure  space with a special focus on the progress achieved in FY24.\n\n1    Meeting India's Infrastructure Needs, ADB, 2017\n\n2    Financing India's Urban Infrastructure Needs World Bank, 2022\n\n3    The Infrastructure Yearbook 2023 published by CRISIL\n\n12.2. The  Chapter  is  divided  into  six  sections.  Section  II  investigates  the  question  of infrastructure financing within the limitations of data and stresses the need for greater balance between private capital and public investment, which will be constrained by the requirements of fiscal consolidation by the Government. Section III discusses sectoral developments, challenges and outlook. Discussion on financial infrastructure and on social infrastructures like health and education is not covered in this chapter as these subjects are discussed in chapters 2, 7 and 8 respectively. The fourth section shows the glimpse of the challenges and the opportunities across the infrastructure sector. Section V examines the efforts by the Government to reduce the  bottlenecks  in  India's  infrastructure  sector.  Section  VI  summarises  the  discussions  and presents some important aspects of the way forward.",
