  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nIndia's external sector remained strong amidst ongoing geopolitical headwinds and sticky inflation. Merchandise exports moderated due to lower demand from major trading partners, but services exports continued to perform well, cushioning the overall trade deficit from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24. Lower prices of imported commodities, including crude oil, also helped. The current account deficit (CAD) improved due to moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports. Software/IT services drove an increase in overall exports, while business services exports also rose, supported by India emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India's participation in global value chains (GVCs) increased, with the share of GVC-related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3% in 2022 from 35.1% in 2019. The country's rank in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023. India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows of USD 44.1 billion in FY24, supported by strong economic growth, a stable business environment, and increased investor confidence. The Indian Rupee remained in a manageable range of ₹82 to ₹83.5/USD in FY24 and was the least volatile currency among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies. The shock absorbers of India's external sector, including forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, and a market-determined exchange rate, are in place to cushion global headwinds. Going forward, the changing composition of India's export basket, enhancement in trade-related infrastructure, enhanced quality consciousness and product safety considerations in the private sector, and a stable policy environment are expected to drive India's rise as a global supplier of goods and services. India's trade openness indicator rose from 37.5 in FY05 to 45.9 in FY24, contributing significantly to economic growth. The share of trade (excluding petroleum products exports and crude oil imports) in GDP rose from 32.3% in FY05 to 40.8% in FY23. India's merchandise exports contracted in H2 of FY23 and H1 of FY24 due to geopolitical tensions but showed a trend reversal in H2 of FY24. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed to USD 238.3 billion in FY24 from USD 264.9 billion in the previous year. Non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery merchandise exports showed resilience with a sustained uptick, resulting in exports worth USD 320.2 billion in FY24, 1.5% higher than the previous year. India's defence production grew substantially from ₹74,054 crore in FY17 to ₹108,684 crore in FY23, boosting defence exports. India's toy exports registered a CAGR of 15.9% between FY13 and FY24, transforming India from a deficit to a surplus nation in the trade of toys. Footwear exports increased from USD 1.9 billion in FY21 to USD 2.5 billion in FY24. Smartphone exports ranked among India's top five export items, with a 42.2% increase in exports in FY24. India's domestic production and exports of smartphones have been increasing steadily, with significant changes achieved since the launch of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020.\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Stable External Debt Position\n\n## STABLE EXTERNAL DEBT POSITION\n\n4.81 The current account can also be expressed as the difference between national (both public and private) savings and investment.  A current account deficit may, therefore, reflect a low level of national savings relative to the desired level of investment. External debt, by supplementing domestic savings, helps countries grow faster. In developing economies, high economic growth is typically associated with high external debt and vice-versa. However, an unsustainable large stock of external debt can potentially create vulnerabilities and dent growth prospects.\n\n4.82 India has managed its external debt prudently with the overarching objective of keeping the  current  account  deficit  within  sustainable  limits  and  encouraging  non-debt  creation  of external finance. India's external debt has been sustainable over the years, as evident in chart IV.38 below. The external debt to GDP ratio declined to 18.7 per cent at the end of March 2024 from 19.0 per cent at the end of March 2023. The share of short-term debt (with original maturity of up to one year) in total external debt declined to 18.5 per cent at the end of March 2024 from 20.6 per cent at the end of March 2023. The ratio of FER to total debt stood at 97.4 per cent as of March 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource: 'External Debt of India-Quarterly and India's External Debt-US Dollars (End March)', Statistics, External Sector, External Debt-RBI\n\nNote: R-Revised, PR-Partially Revised, P-Provisional; ED-External Debt, FER-Foreign Exchange Reserves, TEDTotal External Debt, STED-Short Term External Debt\n\n4.83 Comparing various debt vulnerability indicators of India with peer countries for 2022 indicates that India is in a better position with relatively low levels of total debt as a percentage of Gross National Income (GNI) and short-term external debt as a percentage of total external debt. The comfortable level of FER offers additional comfort.\n\nTable IV.3: India's key external debt indicators: A snapshot of stability\n\n(Per cent, unless indicated otherwise)\n\n| End- March   |   External Debt (USD billion) |   External Debt to GDP |   Debt Service Ratio |   Foreign Exchange Reserves to Total Debt |   Concessional Debt to Total Debt |   Short- Term Debt to Foreign Exchange Reserves |   Short- Term Debt (original maturity) to Total Debt |\n|--------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2018         |                         529.3 |                   20.1 |                  7.5 |                                      80.2 |                               9.1 |                                            24.1 |                                                 19.3 |\n| 2019         |                         543.1 |                   19.9 |                  6.4 |                                      76   |                               8.7 |                                            26.3 |                                                 20   |\n| 2020         |                         558.4 |                   20.9 |                  6.5 |                                      85.6 |                               8.8 |                                            22.4 |                                                 19.1 |\n| 2021         |                         573.4 |                   21.1 |                  8.2 |                                     100.6 |                               9   |                                            17.5 |                                                 17.6 |\n| 2022 R       |                         618.8 |                   19.9 |                  5.2 |                                      98.1 |                               8.3 |                                            20   |                                                 19.7 |\n| 2023PR       |                         624.1 |                   19   |                  5.3 |                                      92.7 |                               8.2 |                                            22.2 |                                                 20.6 |\n| 2024 P       |                         663.8 |                   18.7 |                  6.7 |                                      97.4 |                               7.5 |                                            19   |                                                 18.5 |\n\nSource: Ministry of Finance\n\nR: Revised, PR: Partially Revised; P: Provisional",
