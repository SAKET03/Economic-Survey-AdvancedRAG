  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nIndia's external sector remained strong amidst ongoing geopolitical headwinds and sticky inflation. Merchandise exports moderated due to lower demand from major trading partners, but services exports continued to perform well, cushioning the overall trade deficit from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24. Lower prices of imported commodities, including crude oil, also helped. The current account deficit (CAD) improved due to moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports. Software/IT services drove an increase in overall exports, while business services exports also rose, supported by India emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India's participation in global value chains (GVCs) increased, with the share of GVC-related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3% in 2022 from 35.1% in 2019. The country's rank in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023. India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows of USD 44.1 billion in FY24, supported by strong economic growth, a stable business environment, and increased investor confidence. The Indian Rupee remained in a manageable range of ₹82 to ₹83.5/USD in FY24 and was the least volatile currency among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies. The shock absorbers of India's external sector, including forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, and a market-determined exchange rate, are in place to cushion global headwinds. Going forward, the changing composition of India's export basket, enhancement in trade-related infrastructure, enhanced quality consciousness and product safety considerations in the private sector, and a stable policy environment are expected to drive India's rise as a global supplier of goods and services. India's trade openness indicator rose from 37.5 in FY05 to 45.9 in FY24, contributing significantly to economic growth. The share of trade (excluding petroleum products exports and crude oil imports) in GDP rose from 32.3% in FY05 to 40.8% in FY23. India's merchandise exports contracted in H2 of FY23 and H1 of FY24 due to geopolitical tensions but showed a trend reversal in H2 of FY24. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed to USD 238.3 billion in FY24 from USD 264.9 billion in the previous year. Non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery merchandise exports showed resilience with a sustained uptick, resulting in exports worth USD 320.2 billion in FY24, 1.5% higher than the previous year. India's defence production grew substantially from ₹74,054 crore in FY17 to ₹108,684 crore in FY23, boosting defence exports. India's toy exports registered a CAGR of 15.9% between FY13 and FY24, transforming India from a deficit to a surplus nation in the trade of toys. Footwear exports increased from USD 1.9 billion in FY21 to USD 2.5 billion in FY24. Smartphone exports ranked among India's top five export items, with a 42.2% increase in exports in FY24. India's domestic production and exports of smartphones have been increasing steadily, with significant changes achieved since the launch of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# EXTERNAL SECTOR: STABILITY AMID PLENTY\n\n## EXTERNAL SECTOR: STABILITY AMID PLENTY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndia's  external  sector  remained  strong  amidst  ongoing  geopolitical  headwinds accompanied  by  sticky  inflation.

Amongst services exports, software/IT services have driven an increase in overall exports; at the same time, business services exports have also been rising,  supported  by  India  emerging  as  a  hub  for  Global  Capability Centres (GCCs).\n\nIndia  is  moving  up  the  global  value  chains  (GVCs),  with  the  share  of  GVC-related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3 per cent in 2022 from 35.1 per cent in 2019. The improvement in GVC participation is also reflected in increased pure backward GVC participation. Aided by government measures on trade facilitation and reduction in logistics cost, India's rank in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023 out of 139 countries.\n\nIndia witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows in FY24 of USD 44.1  billion,  supported  by  strong  economic  growth,  a  stable  business  environment, and  increased  investor  confidence.  Rising  FPI  inflows  kept  the  Indian  Rupee  in  a manageable  range  of  ₹82  to  ₹83.5/USD  in  FY24.
