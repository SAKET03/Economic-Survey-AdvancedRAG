The economy grew at 8.2% in FY24, posting growth of over 7% for a third consecutive year. The growth has been inclusive with a reduction in unemployment and multi-dimensional poverty and an increase in labor force participation. The global economy achieved greater stability in 2023, with a growth of 3.2%. However, uncertainty stemming from adverse geopolitical developments remained elevated. The Indian economy's growth was driven by stable consumption demand and steadily improving investment demand. The gross value added (GVA) at 2011-12 prices grew by 7.2% in FY24, with growth remaining broad-based. The shares of the agriculture, industry, and services sector in overall GVA at current prices were 17.7%, 27.6%, and 54.7% respectively in FY24. The manufacturing sector grew by 9.9% in FY24, while construction activities registered a growth of 9.9%. The services sector demonstrated double-digit growth in FY24, with financial and professional services being a major driver of growth. Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) grew by 4.0% in real terms in FY24. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) continues to emerge as an important driver of growth. The banking and financial sector is well-positioned to cater to the growing financing needs of investment demand. The fiscal deficit of the Union Government has been brought down from 6.4% of GDP in FY23 to 5.6% of GDP in FY24. The revenue receipts of the union government increased by 14.5% in FY24. The growth in gross tax revenue (GTR) was estimated to be 13.4% in FY24. The government has followed a path of fiscal consolidation while continuing to protect the vulnerable sections and investing in the productive capacity of the economy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has maintained policy rates at a high level to battle inflationary pressures. The Indian economy is expected to grow at 6.5-7% in FY25, with risks evenly balanced.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# STATE OF THE ECONOMY: STEADY AS SHE GOES\n\n## STATE OF THE ECONOMY: STEADY AS SHE GOES\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIndia's calibrated response to the pandemic on the economic front included three salient components. The first has been the focus on public spending on infrastructure, which kept the economy afloat by creating a strong demand for jobs and industrial output and triggered a lagged yet vigorous private investment response. Stronger balance sheets of the financial and non-financial private sector helped, aided by a decade of supporting initiatives by the Government and the Reserve Bank of India. The second has been partly a natural response of business enterprise and public administration amidst adversities, i.e., digitalisation of service delivery. The public policy focus and nurturing of processes and frameworks in digital technology greatly helped this irreversible and transformational  change.  The  third  has  been  embodied  in  the  Atmanirbhar  Bharat Abhiyan in terms of targeted relief to different sectors of the economy and sections of the population, and structural reforms that assisted a firm recovery and increased the medium-term growth potential.\n\nGlobal  troubles,  supply  chain  disruptions,  and  vagaries  of  monsoons  intermittently stoked  domestic  inflationary  pressures,  which  were,  to  a  great  extent,  managed  by administrative  and  monetary  policy  responses.    The  fiscal  balances  of  the  general government-central  and State Governments  taken together -have improved progressively despite expansionary public investment. Tax compliance gains driven by  procedural  reforms,  expenditure  restraint,  and  increasing  digitisation  helped India achieve this fine balance. The external balance has been pressured by subdued global  demand  for  goods,  but  strong  services  exports  largely  counterbalanced  this. Global output is now somewhat more resilient than in 2022, inflationary pressures are shrinking, and trade is set to recover, should there be no further geo-political shocks or flare-ups. However, the chances of geopolitical disturbances and conflicts have only gone up in recent times.\n\nThe net impact of these developments has been that the Indian economy recovered and expanded in an orderly fashion in the last three years. The real GDP in FY24 was 20 per cent higher than its level in FY20, a feat that only a very few major economies achieved, while also leaving a strong possibility for robust growth in FY25 and beyond. Growth has been inclusive with a reduction in unemployment and multi-dimensional poverty and an increase in labour force participation. Overall, the Indian economy looks forward to FY25 optimistically, anticipating broad-based and inclusive growth.",
