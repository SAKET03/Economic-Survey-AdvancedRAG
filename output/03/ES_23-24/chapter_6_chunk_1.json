  "content": "Chapter 6 Summary:\nIndia, one of the fastest-growing economies, has an annual per capita carbon emission of about one-third of the global average. The country envisions a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, with Net Zero carbon emissions by 2070 guiding its interventions for high and robust economic growth. India faces challenges in balancing development needs with a low-carbon pathway. The global approach to dealing with climate change is flawed as it ignores trade-offs. Developed nations have postponed their climate-related targets, such as the UK delaying the ban on petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030 to 2035. Germany diluted its rules for banning boilers running on fossil fuels. The rise of alternative political parties in developed nations is attributed to public resistance to climate-related rules. Climate change continues to dominate policy and discourses worldwide. India's energy needs are expected to grow 2 to 2.5 times by 2047. The country aims to add 30 GW of solar capacity and reduce 720 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. India has made significant progress on climate action, achieving 40% cumulative electrical power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in 2021. The country has updated its Nationally Determined Contribution, enhancing its targets. India submitted its Third National Communication and first Adaptation Communication to the UNFCCC in December 2023. The energy sector contributed the most to overall anthropogenic emissions at 75.81%. India's GDP grew at a CAGR of about 7% between 2005 and 2019, while emissions grew at a CAGR of about 4%. The country has successfully decoupled its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. India is on track to make an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes through tree and forest cover by 2030. The country has adopted the mission-mode approach to address climate change through the National Action Plan on Climate Change. India has made significant progress in renewable energy, with a cumulative solar power capacity of 82.64 GW as of April 2024. The Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme has resulted in significant energy savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. India aims to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030 from 2005 levels. The country has launched several initiatives to improve energy efficiency, including the Energy Conservation Building Code and the Standards and Labelling program. India's energy mix is expected to change significantly, with a share of non-fossil power capacity reaching 45.4% as of May 2024. The country aims to achieve Net Zero by 2070, requiring an orderly transition to a diversified mix of energy sources. India has launched initiatives such as PM-Surya Ghar Yojana to enhance renewable energy production. The country has also notified the national offshore wind energy policy and offshore wind energy lease rules. India's Green Hydrogen Mission targets 5 MMT of green hydrogen by 2030. The electrolysis and renewable energy used as inputs are major components of green hydrogen production cost. India faces challenges in energy transition, including intermittency and discontinuous supply of renewable energy. The country needs to develop energy storage systems, including battery storage. India has announced a viability gap funding scheme for offshore wind energy projects. The country aims to triple its global renewable energy capacity and accelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power. India has emphasized the importance of energy efficiency measures in accelerating clean energy transitions. The country has implemented several measures to improve energy efficiency, including the Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme and the Standards and Labelling program. India's carbon market will allow the determination of a price for one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The country has established the Indian Carbon Market to enable a per-output emissions limit. India aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve Net Zero by 2070. The country needs to enhance international cooperation in R&D, especially in domains such as distributed RE, offshore wind, and green hydrogen. India faces challenges in accessing affordable finance for its low-carbon development pathway. The country requires an estimated USD 2.5 trillion in investments to achieve its climate goals. India has taken several measures to improve the business environment and catalyze greater quantum of resources. The country has issued sovereign green bonds to raise proceeds for public sector projects. India's Mission LiFE aims to encourage the adoption of sustainable lifestyles to address climate change. The country supports voluntary environmental actions such as the Green Credit Programme. India has led several international initiatives towards climate change mitigation and building resilience. The country has established the International Solar Alliance to deploy solar energy solutions. India aims to interconnect solar energy systems on a massive scale through the One World, One Sun, One Grid initiative. The country has launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems. India aims to achieve its ambitious growth targets while reducing carbon emissions. The country faces the dual challenge of meeting energy demands while reducing carbon emissions. India's energy needs are expected to grow significantly, and the country needs to target a diversified set of energy sources.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n- 6.1. Since the last Economic Survey was written, there has been no dearth of conferences, meetings,  and  summits  dedicated  to  climate  change.  It  continues  to  dominate  policy  and other discourses around the world. It provides a ready-made topic for think tanks, experts, and policy wonks to appear suitably concerned. However, the world is realising what experts and policymakers in advanced nations are resisting - that its current approach to dealing with climate  change  is  flawed  for  one  very  simple  reason.  It  continues  to  ignore  trade-offs.  But practical men and women have been unable to avoid recognising trade-offs. Countries had to push back their own timelines.\n- 6.2. The United Kingdom postponed its decision to ban the sale of vehicles that run on petrol and diesel for five years from 2030 to 2035. Germany had to dilute its rules for banning boilers running on fossil fuels  before  they  could  be  passed.  The  rise  of  alternative  political  parties in developed nations is attributed to the public's resistance to climate-related rules that are perceived as unfairly targeting the poor and low-income by raising their cost of living. According to  Bloomberg,  German  businesses  cite  rising  energy  costs  as  the  single  biggest  reason  for relocating out of the country 1 . That is the crux of the challenge that governments are grappling with.\n- 6.3. Alternative  energy  sources  require  fiscal  subsidies  to  be  affordable.  However,  most governments worldwide are fiscally stretched, especially after dealing with the economic and\n\n1   'Germany's Days as an Industrial Superpower Are Coming to an End', 10th February 2024, Bloomberg (https:// www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-02-10/why-germany-s-days-as-an-industrial-superpower-arecoming-to-an-end)\n\nhealth dislocations caused by the pandemic. Many countries also tax fossil fuels heavily. By clamping down on their usage, governments will lose those revenues. Geopolitically, the thrust on renewable energy and electric vehicles has set off a race to secure critical minerals and rare earths.  China has positioned itself as an indispensable source of several of these materials. Securing supply in crunch times is a matter of concern. Nuclear energy is the cleanest and safest  option.  However,  some  nations  are  reluctant  to  consider  it  given  that  their  public overestimates probabilities of rare events, as humans are wont to. Three-mile island, Chernobyl and Fukushima, loom large in people's minds. Prof. Daniel Kahneman, who passed away earlier this year, would have chuckled. 2\n\n- 6.4. Relatively common metals like copper and nickel are going to become scarcer. In 'The Material World', Ed Conway wrote that the world might need more copper in the next few decades than it has ever used since the metal was known to humans. Not just copper but other metals will also be in short supply. The price of energy transition will be too much for most nations. It will only get worse. More importantly, extracting materials and minerals requires a tremendous amount of energy. Analysts in JP Morgan wrote 3 , \"… just developing the forecasted wind and solar capacities would require ~ 10EJ of energy during 2024-30, which is equivalent to ~20% of our projected global energy demand growth over the same period (forecasts based on our Global Energy Outlook) and will emit ~1,450 mn tonnes of CO2e (~207 mn tonnes on average, equivalent to the annual emissions of Pakistan or Argentina in 2022). Additionally, the  projected  penetration  of  electric  vehicles  in  the  global  light-duty  vehicle  fleet  requires another ~10EJ of energy to build and charge these EVs. '\n\n6.5. The  other  factor  is  time.  Nowhere  in  the  world  has  energy  transition  of  this  scale happened within the short time envisaged. Vaclav Smil wrote in 2014, 4 \"… each widespread transition from one dominant fuel to another has taken 50 to 60 years…. Energy transitions on  a  national  or  global  scale  are  inherently  protracted  affairs.  The  unfolding  shift  from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources will be no exception. It will require generations of perseverance .' In fact, he wrote that the more effective solution was to lower overall energy use. Alas, that is one advice that the world is either unable to or unwilling to heed. It is hard to fault developing countries for not wanting to curb their energy consumption. It is morally wrong to tell developing countries to abandon their aspirations for better living standards so that developed countries can maintain their ways of living in cleaner environments and cooler climates.\n\n6.6. However, the Paris Agreement signed in December 2015 did precisely that. It trumped the Sustainable Development Goals agreed upon barely three months earlier. Professor Mike Hulme wrote,  5  \" The goal of securing global temperature within a certain numerical range took precedence over a broader set of welfare ambitions, in part because of the success of\n\n2 His research showed that humans beings consistently overestimate the probability of rare events\n\n3   'The Energy Transition', 18th April 2024, Global Energy Strategy, JP Morgan\n\n4   Vaclav Smil: 'A Global Transition to Renewable Energy Will Take Many Decades', Scientific American, January 2014 (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-global-transition-to-renewable-energy-will-take-manydecades/)\n\n5   Hulme, Mike.

Kindle Edition.\n\nclimate scientists and Government negotiators in characterising the goal of climate policies in terms of a single, and seemingly simple, index. Yet, …global temperature is a seriously flawed index  for  capturing  the  full  range  of  complex  relationships  between  climate  and  human welfare and ecological integrity .'\n\n- 6.7. Not  only  have  development  goals  been  downgraded  in  the  process  of  elevation  of containing global emissions to the pinnacle of all economic policies, but developing nations are also being threatened with a carbon tax at the border, in full negation of the spirit of common but  differentiated  responsibilities  and  respective  national  capabilities  that  was  supposed  to have undergirded the Paris Agreement.\n- 6.8. It would be a comedy if it were not real and tragic. Even as developed nations prepare to impose a carbon tax at the border on imports coming into their countries laden with carbon, they are ramping up energy demand like never before, thanks to their obsession with letting Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  guide,  take  over  and  dominate  natural  intelligence.  One  of  the leading  global  technology  companies  promised  to  achieve  Net  Zero  by  2030  at  the  turn  of the decade. But, the race to dominate the emerging technology of Artificial Intelligence has caused its emissions to be higher by 30 per cent by 2023. In a research report 6  published in April, analysts in Goldman Sachs wrote that the demand for power in the United States would experience a growth not seen in a generation, thanks to AI and that \" transmission, one of the major bottlenecks for clean energy transition, and the addition of data centres and AI could exacerbate this \". This and other issues pertaining to managing energy demand as a sensible way of dealing with climate change are examined intensely and analysed forensically in Chapter 13 in a special essay.\n- 6.9. However, these developments should convince any reasonable reader that the developed world has not only tied itself into knots but is also contributing - wittingly or otherwise to deepening and entrenching poverty and inequality in developing and consigning them to perpetual  underdeveloped  status  by  coercing  them  into  prioritising  emissions  over  their economies.  Developed  countries,  having  relied  on  a  fossil  fuel-based  growth  strategy  for the past two centuries to reach where they are today, seek ambitious cuts in emissions from developing countries, pushing them to adopt policy measures, instruments and production and energy systems that are distinctly different from the carbon-emitting traditional strategies that fuelled the growth of the former. The fact that these novel pathways are untested or trusted is apparent from the recent deliberations of the G7 countries on ending the use of unabated coal power plants only in the first half of 2030, 7  even when their carbon emissions peaked several decades ago. Japan and Germany did not agree to this. In contrast, Germany has written into its legislation a final target to shut coal plants by 2038, while Japan has yet to set a date. This is a recipe for intra and international conflicts. 8\n\n6   'Generational growth: AI, data centres and the coming US power demand surge', 28th April 2024, Goldman Sachs Equity Research\n\n7   G7, Climate, Energy and Environment Ministers' Meeting Communiqué, (Torino, April 29-30, 2024),  https:// www.meti.go.jp/press/2024/05/20240501001/20240501001-a.pdf.\n\n8   Francesca Landini, G7 to sign exit from coal by 2035, but may offer leeway, sources say, Reuters, (April 30, 2024), https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/g7-ministers-agree-coal-plants-shutdown-by-2030-2035uk-says-2024-04-29/.\n\n6.10.  The impact of climate change will affect developing countries disproportionately because these countries are already vulnerable and less resilient and must prioritise their economic development  needs.  Though  not  part  of  the  problem,  developing  countries  are  part  of  the solution. Developing countries have already accepted the need for ambitious greenhouse gas emissions reduction, as evidenced by their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), on the condition that the developed countries provide resources at a reasonable cost. Incorporating the impact of climate change into the development model, also called the low-carbon development pathways,  requires  access  to  technology  and  financial  resources  in  the  order  of  trillions  of dollars.  Even  by  conservative  standards,  the  estimate  of  resource  requirement  (considering that not all the needs have been costed) ranges between USD 5.8 - 11.5 trillion till 2030 9 . With financial  resources  and  technology  not  reaching  developing  countries  at  the  desired  pace, quantity, or terms, economic growth, and prosperity, albeit sustainably, will equip developing countries with the strength to address climate change.\n\n6.11. Globally,  recognising  trade-offs  is  critical  to  bringing  climate  goals  into  the  realm  of feasibility and acceptability. To recognise trade-offs, we need to be  able to ask the right and, more importantly, honest questions.\n\n6.12. One such question is ' Is imagining a world without climate change all that useful? It almost goes without saying that if we could keep the benefits of fossil-fuelled industrialisation and jettison the negative side effects of climate change, we would do so. But what makes decision-making so thorny is that for most climate-sensitive societal outcomes….the net effect of  fossil-fuelled  industrialisation  and  technological  change  has  been  good…Thus,  'without climate  change'  is  not  always  the  most  relevant  hypothetical  counterfactual,  and  often 'without fossil-fuelled industrialisation and technological progress' is more relevant. This framing gives a more honest and holistic picture of the state of the climate change problem, and it does not misleadingly paint the current systems as being less attractive than they actually are. When we assess the best course of action going forward, we must compare alternative systems and weigh the benefits of avoided climate change against the costs of transitioning to alternative energy and agricultural systems over time. This is the only way to be accurate and forthright on the trade-offs we face .' 10\n\n6.13. Fittingly, the last word of this introductory section should be left to Mike Hulme, who has been studying the phenomenon for more than four decades:\n\n\"Climate change isn't everything. It is quite easy to imagine future worlds in which global temperature exceeds 2°C warming which are 'better' for human well-being, political stability and ecological integrity, for example, than other worlds in which - by all means and at all costs - global temperature was stabilised at 1.5°C.\"\n\n6.14. As for India, despite the challenges mentioned above, managing the impact of climate change while ensuring that developmental priorities continue to get the focus has been the hallmark of its  growth  strategy.
