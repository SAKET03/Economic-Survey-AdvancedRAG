  "content": "Chapter 3 Summary:\nThe chapter discusses India's inflation management, focusing on prices and inflation. The pandemic and geopolitical tensions presented challenges to global economic stability, affecting India significantly. Supply disruptions and increased commodity prices led to elevated inflationary pressures in FY23 and FY24. However, prudent monetary policy responses and calibrated trade policy measures helped reduce core inflation to a four-year low in FY24. Food inflation was mitigated through administrative actions, including dynamic stock management and subsidized provision of essential food items. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) inflation projections indicate a benign and range-bound inflation outlook for India. India's retail inflation was 5.4% in FY24, the lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic. The inflation rate was within the target range of 2-6% in 2023. India's inflation management was relatively better compared to developed and emerging economies. The chapter highlights key policy recommendations, including strengthening price monitoring mechanisms, increasing domestic production of essential food items, and improving storage and processing facilities for vegetables. The RBI and IMF project India's consumer price inflation to align towards the inflation target in FY26, with projected inflation rates of 4.5% in FY25 and 4.1% in FY26. The World Bank expects a 3% decline in the commodity price index in 2024 and a 4% decrease in 2025. The chapter emphasizes the importance of focused efforts to increase the production of major oilseeds, pulses, and other essential food items to stabilize domestic prices and mitigate import dependence.\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Outlook and Way Forward\n\n## OUTLOOK AND WAY FORWARD\n\n3.27. The RBI and the IMF have projected that India's consumer price inflation will progressively align towards the inflation target in FY26. Assuming a normal monsoon and no further external or policy shocks, the RBI 9 expects headline inflation to be 4.5 per cent in FY25 and 4.1 per cent\n\n9    Monetary Policy Report, April 2024, Page 7. https://tinyurl.com/39p6phfu\n\nin FY26. IMF 10   has projected an inflation rate of 4.6 per cent in 2024 and 4.2 per cent in 2025 for India.\n\n3.28. The World Bank 11  expects that the global supply of commodities will increase, and so will  their  demand  due  to  improved  industrial  activity  and  trade  growth.  It  projects  a  3  per cent decline in the commodity price index in 2024 and a 4 per cent decrease in 2025, mainly driven by lower energy, food and fertiliser prices. The energy price index is expected to reduce due to significant declines in coal and natural gas prices this year. Fertiliser prices are likely to weaken but remain above 2015-2019 levels due to strong demand and export restrictions. Base metal prices are projected to rise, reflecting increased global industrial activity and clean energy production. In general, the current downward movement in the prices of commodities imported by India is a positive for the domestic inflation outlook.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: World Bank Commodity Price Forecast released in April 2024\n\nNote: (i) Total price index is composed of energy and non-energy prices (excluding precious metals), weighted by their share in 2002-04 exports.\n\n- (ii) The energy price index includes coal (Australia), crude oil (Brent), and natural gas (Europe, Japan, U.S.).\n- (iii) Metals &amp; minerals include iron ore, aluminium, copper, lead, nickel, tin, and zinc.\n\n3.29. On balance, the short-term inflation outlook for India is benign. However, from the angle of long-term price stability, the following options may be worth exploring.\n\n- The domestic consumption of edible oils has been increasing faster than production, leading to increased import dependence. To reverse this pattern and to stabilise domestic prices, it is important to make focused efforts to increase the production of major oilseeds such as sunflower and rapeseed &amp; mustard, and explore the potential of non-conventional oils such as rice bran oil and corn oil. The possibility of expanding the scope of the National Mission on Edible Oils beyond palm oil to other major oilseeds is worth an examination.\n\n10  World Economic Outlook, April 2024, page 36. https://tinyurl.com/38pederj\n\n11  World Bank's Commodity Markets Outlook Report of April 2024. https://tinyurl.com/2vzxr694\n\n- India  faces  a  persistent  deficit  in  pulses  and  consequent  price  pressures.  Production  of pulses is concentrated in a few states and districts in the country, and is vulnerable to biotic and abiotic stresses. More efforts are needed to expand the area under pulses, particularly lentils, tur, and urad, in more districts and rice-fallow areas. It is also worth considering promoting the  summer cultivation  of  urad  and  moong  in  areas  with  assured  irrigation facilities.\n- There have been many efforts by the Government to improve the storage and processing facilities for vegetables. In view of the continuing seasonal surges in the prices of vegetables like tomato and onion, it is important to assess the progress in developing modern storage facilities conducive to such specific crops, and evaluate the viability of such facilities whose services have highly seasonal demand.\n- FY24 witnessed swift and effective administrative action by the Government to deal with price  flare-ups  in  specific  items.  This  was  based  on  daily  monitoring  of  prices  at  more than 500 centres. Prospectively, an important factor that can improve the swiftness and effectiveness of such action is complete clarity on prices and their indices. On this front, it may be important to fine-tune and expedite the ongoing action in the following areas.\n- � The high-frequency price monitoring data for essential food items collected by different departments may be linked in such a way that the build-up of prices at each stage from the farm gate to the final consumer is quantifiable and monitorable.\n- � The ongoing efforts to construct the producer price index for goods and services may be expedited to have a greater grasp of episodes of cost-push inflation. Further, considering that the results of the household consumer expenditure survey, 2022-23 of MoSPI are available, it may be appropriate to expeditiously revise the consumer price index with fresh weights and item baskets.\n\nAnnexure 1: Group of items and their weights used for the derived consumer prices indices for the components of core inflation\n\n|                              |               |               |              |              | Core goods            | Core goods            | Core goods        | Core goods        |\n|------------------------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n|                              | Core services | Core services | Core goods   | Core goods   | Consumer non-durables | Consumer non-durables | Consumer durables | Consumer durables |\n| Major Groups/sub- groups     | No. of Items  | Total Weight  | No. of Items | Total Weight | No. of Items          | Total Weight          | No. of Items      | Total Weight      |\n| Pan, tobacco and intoxicants | -             | -             | 16           | 2.4          | 16                    | 2.4                   | -                 | -                 |\n| Clothing and footwear        | 2             | 0.5           | 25           | 6.0          | -                     | -                     | 25                | 6.0               |\n| Household goods and services | 4             | 0.9           | 44           | 2.9          | 8                     | 1.7                   | 36                | 1.2               |\n| Health                       | 4             | 1.8           | 3            | 4.1          | 2                     | 4.0                   | 1                 | 0.1               |\n| Transport and communication  | 13            | 4.6           | 8            | 4.0          | 3                     | 2.4                   | 5                 | 1.6               |\n| Recreation and amusement     | 8             | 1.1           | 9            | 0.6          | 1                     | 0.2                   | 8                 | 0.4               |\n| Education                    | 3             | 3.5           | 2            | 1.0          | 2                     | 1.0                   | -                 | -                 |\n| Personal care and effects    | 1             | 0.6           | 15           | 3.3          | 7                     | 2.1                   | 8                 | 1.3               |\n| Housing                      | 10            | 10.1          | -            | -            | -                     | -                     | -                 | -                 |\n| Total                        | 45            | 23.0          | 122          | 24.3         | 39                    | 13.7                  | 83                | 10.6              |\n\nSource: Calculated from the Consumer Price Indices released by CSO, MoSPI\n\nNote: The total weight of core goods and services in the Consumer Price Index is 47.3 per cent, which is the total of the weights of core goods and core services.
