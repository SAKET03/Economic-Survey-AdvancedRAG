The decline in the annual youth unemployment rate accompanied by greater youth participation in the labour force indicates better utilisation of this dynamic resource.\n\n8.9 According to PLFS, youth (age 15-29 years) unemployment rate has declined from 17.8 per cent in 2017-18 to 10 per cent in 2022-23, while other indicators have also improved over time.  The  rise  in  youth  employment  is  also  reflected  in  the  formal  employment  figures,  as per Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) data, presented in latter section of the chapter. The annual new EPF subscribers aged 18-28 years have been following an upward trajectory  after  witnessing  a  decline  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Nearly  two-thirds  of the new subscribers in the EPFO payroll have been from the 18-28 years band. Thus, youth employment has been rising in tandem with the youth population.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Rise in Female LFPR: Unfolding the gender dividend\n\n8.10  From  the  gender  perspective,  the  female  labour  force  participation  rate  (FLFPR)  has been rising  for  six  years.  While  urban  FLFPR  has  also  been  growing,  the  rural  FLFPR  has witnessed a steep rise of 16.9 percentage points between 2017-18 and 2022-23, indicating a rising contribution of women to rural production. This could culminate from multiple factors,\n\nincluding continuous high growth in agriculture output and freeing up of women's time due to substantial expansion of access to basic amenities such as piped drinking water, clean cooking fuel, sanitation, etc. On the other hand, the possibility of the rise in FLFPR stemming from distress does not hold much ground since distress-driven FLFPR should have peaked during COVID-19 and declined afterwards instead of continuously rising since 2017-18. Other reasons that repudiate the thesis of distress-driven rise in FLFPR were elaborated in ' Indian Economy - A Review ', published by DEA, Ministry of Finance in January 2024. 6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: PLFS reports, NSO\n\nNote: for usual status, 15 years and above\n\n## Employment in Factories\n\n8.11 The  Annual  Survey  of  Industries 7   (ASI)  results  for  2020-21  and  2021-22  showcased the  Indian  manufacturing  sector's  resilience,  given  its  turnaround  after  a  marginal  fall  in employment in the pandemic year of 2020-21. As per ASI 2021-22, employment in the organised manufacturing sector recovered to above the pre-pandemic level, with the employment per factory continuing its pre-pandemic rise. The growth in wages per worker resumed after a brief hiatus.  This,  coupled  with  higher  wage  growth  in  the  rural  areas  during  the  last  five  years, bodes well for demand creation in the countryside. 8  During FY15-FY22, the wages per worker in rural areas grew at 6.9 per cent CAGR vis-Ã -vis a corresponding 6.1 per cent CAGR in urban areas.\n\n6    The  publication  is  available  at  https://dea.gov.in/sites/default/files/Monthly%20Economic%20Review%20 January%202024.pdf\n\n7    The ASI, conducted by the MoSPI, covers the organised manufacturing sector of the economy. Its coverage extends to the entire Factory Sector comprising industrial units (called factories) registered under the Sections 2(m)(i) and 2(m)(ii) of the Factories Act, 1948, with ten or more workers with electricity or twenty or more workers without electricity.\n\n8    It may be noted that, as of FY22, 42 per cent of factories and 45 per cent of workers are in rural areas.\n\n## Chart VIII.8: Trend in employment in organised manufacturing sector\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChart VIII.9: Trend in employment per factory\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChart VIII.10: YoY growth in wages per worker\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Annual Survey of Industries reports, MoSPI\n\nNote: TPE: Total Persons Engaged\n\n8.12  State-wise, the top six states in terms of the number of factories, were also the greatest factory  employment  creators.  More  than  40  per  cent  of  factory  employment  was  in  Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. In contrast, the highest employment growth between FY18 and FY22 was seen in states with a higher share of young population, including Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh (Chart VIII.12). 9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChart VIII.12: Top six states in five years (FY18-FY22) growth in employment in factories\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Annual Survey of Industries reports, MoSPI\n\nNote: TPE: Total Persons Engaged\n\n8.13  In  terms  of  number  of  establishments,  the  organised  manufacturing  landscape  is  dominated by smaller factories. In 2021-22, factories employing less than 100 people constituted 79.2 per cent of all factories while contributing only 22.1 per cent of total persons employed and 20.9 per cent of workers. This has been improving over time as there is a visible trend towards a rise\n\n9    The projected share of population below 30 years is 55.5 % in Chhattisgarh, 52.8% in Haryana, and 60.1 per cent in UP. Source: M/o Health and Family Welfare projections available at https://tinyurl.com/2knzk5xe\n\nin larger factories. Compared to a broadly constant number of smaller factories, the number of factories employing more than 100 workers saw 11.8 per cent growth over FY18 to FY22. Thus, in terms of total persons engaged, employment has been rising in bigger factories (employing more than 100 workers) than in smaller ones, suggesting a scaling up of manufacturing units. This is a positive development in terms of quality of employment, as wages per worker tend to rise with the employment size of factories.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Annual Survey of Industries reports, MoSPI\n\n8.14  In terms of the sectoral share of factory employment (total persons engaged), the food products industry (11.1 per cent) remained the largest employer, followed by textiles, primary metals, wearing apparel and motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers. However, in terms of growth in employment in the last five years, the rising heft of computers and electronics, rubber and plastic products, and chemicals indicates that Indian manufacturing is moving up the value chain and have emerged as sunrise sectors for manufacturing employment generation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Annual Survey of Industries reports, MoSPI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Enrolment in EPFO\n\n8.15  The organised sector job market conditions measured by payroll data for EPFO indicate a consistent year-on-year (YoY) increase in payroll addition since FY19 (the earliest since data is available). The yearly net payroll additions to the EPFO more than doubled from 61.1 lakh in FY19 to 131.5 lakh in FY24, swiftly recovering from the pandemic aided by the Aatmanirbhar Bharat  Rojgar  Yojana  (ABRY).  The  EPFO  membership  numbers  (for  which  older  data  is available)  grew  by  an  impressive  8.4  per  cent  CAGR  between  FY15  and  FY24  (refer  Chart VIII.18).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: EPFO Monthly Reports available at https://www.epfindia.gov.in/site\\_en/Estimate\\_of\\_Payroll.php\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Government initiatives to boost employment generation\n\n8.16  The Government has implemented a series of measures to boost employment generation, such  as  the  rollout  of  the  Production  Linked  Incentive  (PLI)  scheme  to  enhance  India's manufacturing  capabilities,  increase  in  capital  expenditure,  etc.,  and  to  promote  worker welfare. This has been accompanied by a boost to self-employment through easing of access to credit, and multiple process reforms. Some of the schemes to promote both job creation and job creators are summarised in the Box VIII.1.\n\n## Box VIII.1: Initiatives to foster job creation and workers' welfare\n\n- Launched\tin\t2015,\tthe National Career Service (NCS) Portal offers employment and career services. By 31 March 2024, it has attracted 4.1 crore jobseekers and 25.6 lakh employers. The initiative includes 407 Model Career Centres and over 46,000 job fairs, with a 52 per cent increase in candidates shortlisted for jobs in FY24 compared to FY23, indicating a more competitive job market.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- The e-Shram  portal  is the  first-ever  national  database  of  unorganised  workers with more than 29 crore workers registered. The portal has been integrated with the NCS portal to facilitate job search and aims to integrate with other relevant portals of different central Ministries/Departments in order to facilitate access of different Central Government schemes to unorganised workers at one place.\n- In\t October\t 2020,\t the\t Government\t introduced\t the\t Aatmanirbhar\t Bharat\t Rojgar Yojana (ABRY)  to boost employment with social security benefits post-COVID-19 job losses. By 31 March 2024, the scheme benefited 60.5 lakh individuals across 1.5 lakh establishments. 10\n- The\tGovernment\thas\tlaunched\ttwo\tsignificant\tcontributory\tpension\tschemes\tto\tensure minimum  pension  for  all  workers .  The  Atal  Pension  Yojana  (APY),  launched in 2015, has more than 6.5 crore subscribers now. 11  More than 50 lakh workers have enrolled under Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maan-Dhan (PM-SYM) scheme, launched in 2019. 12\n- Affordable insurance programmes : Life and Disability cover is provided through Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima\tYojana\t(PMSBY)\tof\tâ¹2\tlakh\tat\tan\tannual\tpremium\tof\tâ¹436\tand\tâ¹20\tonly.\n- The\tnew\tLabour\tCodes\tnow\tprovide social security benefits to gig and platform workers via a Social Security Fund, financed by contributions from the Central and State  Governments,  Aggregators,  CSR  etc.  Additionally,  the  definition  of  Inter-State Migrant labour has been simplified.\n- PM\tStreet\tVendor's\tAatmaNirbhar\tNidhi\t( PM SVANidhi ) Scheme, launched in June 2020 to facilitate collateral-free working capital loans to street vendors has more than 64 lakh beneficiaries to its credit. 13\n- The One Nation One Ration Card programme, launched in 2019, has enhanced migrant workers' welfare by allowing portable food security across India. Till December 2023, it facilitated over 124 crore portability transactions. 14\n- Prime  Minister's  Employment  Generation  Programme  (PMEGP) :  The Government is implementing PMEGP for assisting entrepreneurs in setting up of new units in the non-farm sector. It aims to provide employment opportunities to traditional artisans/  rural  and  urban  unemployed  youth  at  their  doorstep.  Since  2018-19  to  30 January 2024, estimated employment generated (no. of persons) are 37.46 lakhs.\n- Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Urban Livelihoods Mission : (DAYNULM):  The  Mission  aims  to  reduce  poverty  and  vulnerability  of  the  urban  poor households by enabling them to access self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities,  resulting  in  an  appreciable  improvement  in  their  livelihoods  on  a sustainable basis. Since 2018-19 to 30 January 2024, estimated number of skill trained candidates placed under DAY- NULM are 5.48 lakhs.\n\n10    Success of AB-RPY, link available at: https://labour.gov.in/aatmanirbhar-bharat-rojgar-yojana-abry\n\n11    As per information received from PFRDA\n\n12    Includes bulk enrolments of 506603.\n\n13    https://www.pmsvanidhi.mohua.gov.in/Home/PMSDashboard\n\n14    Lok sabha unstarred question 1784 dated 13.12.2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Pradhan  Mantri  Mudra  Yojana (PMMY):  PMMY  is  being  implemented  by  the Government for facilitating  self-employment.  Under  PMMY,  collateral  free  loans  up to\t â¹10\t lakh,\t are\t extended\t to\t micro/small\t business\t enterprises\t and\t to\t individuals\t to enable them to set up or expand their business activities. Around 47.7 crore loans were sanctioned under the scheme as on 29 March 2024.\n- Stand  Up  India: Launched  on  5  April,  2016,  the  scheme  aims  to  promote entrepreneurship  among  the  SC/ST  and  Women  by  facilitating  bank  loans  of  value between\tâ¹10\tlakh\tand\tâ¹1\tcrore\tto\tat\tleast\tone\tSC/\tST\tborrower\tand\tone-woman\tborrower per bank branch of Scheduled Commercial Banks for setting up greenfield enterprises in trading, manufacturing, services sector and in activities allied to agriculture.

The  Government  rationalised  and  amalgamated  29  central  laws  into  four Labour Codes in 2019 and 2020, after extensive consultations with stakeholders and public from 2015 to 2019. This was to promote employment creation and freeing workers from the web of legislations many of which trace their origins to the pre-independence period, reduce multiplicity  of  definitions  and  authorities  relating  to  labour,  and  to  induce  transparency, accountability,  and  use  of  technology  in  enforcement  of  labour  laws.  Thereafter,  the  four Labour Codes; namely, the Code on Wages, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, the Code on Social Security, 2020 and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020; have been enacted. The Code on Wages, 2019 was notified on 8 August, 2019 and the remaining three Codes were notified on 29 September, 2020.\n\n15    Source: Inputs from Department of Financial Services\n\n16    PIB release dated 12 Feb 2024 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2005206\n\n17    PIB release dated 2 Feb 2024 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2002100\n\n8.18\t 'Labour'\tas\ta\tsubject\tis\tin\tthe\tConcurrent\tList\tof\tthe\tConstitution\tof\tIndia\tand\tunder the Codes, the power to make Rules has been entrusted to Central Government, appropriate Government and State Governments. There is also a requirement of pre-publication of Rules by states in their respective Official Gazette for public consultation. As per available information, 32, 30, 31 and 31 States &amp; UTs have also pre-published their draft Rules under the Code on Wages, 2019, the Industrial Relations Code, 2020, the Code on Social Security, 2020 and the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Code, 2020 respectively.\n\n8.19  However, there remains scope to expedite the enactment of Labour Codes by the states. In addition, there exist other regulatory hurdles to employment generation, some of which are stricter than advanced economies, as elaborated in the Box VIII.2\n\n## Box VIII.2: Re-balancing Labour Regulations to promote employment\n\nCurrent  labour  regulations  have  unintended  adverse  repercussions  for  both  the  general workforce  and  women  specifically.  Although  designed  to  safeguard  women  and  enforce rigorous standards for all employees, these regulations inadvertently restrict employment opportunities and impede overall job creation. Some examples of these rules are mentioned below:\n\n## Higher overtime wage premium compared to peers and advanced economies\n\nA comparison with other countries reveals that India's stricter overtime wage regulations are potentially hindering the growth of the manufacturing sector by driving production to nations with lower overtime costs (Dandekar and Roy, 2023). 18\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Systematic barriers to job opportunities for women\n\nThe 10 most populous states collectively  impose  139  prohibitions  on  women  from  participating in factory processes such as electroplating, petroleum generation, manufacturing of products such as pesticides, glass, rechargeable batteries etc. (Singh, 2023). 19\n\n18    Dandekar, S. &amp; Roy, S.

An Indian factory with 1,000 square metres (sqm) of usable floor space canemploy up to 82 more workers if India were to adopt Malaysia's standard. 20  Increases in space requirements can discourage the expansion of factories.\n\nTable VIII.1: Indian factories could hire more workers by adopting competitive per-worker space standards\n\n| Country     | Per worker space (sqm)   | Additional jobs created   |\n|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n| India       | 3.38                     | N/A                       |\n| Singapore   | 2.88                     | 52                        |\n| Switzerland | 2.86                     | 54                        |\n| Malaysia    | 2.65                     | 82                        |\n| Germany     | 'Sufficient' Space       | N/A                       |\n| Norway      | 'Sufficient' Space       | N/A                       |\n\nSource: Kaur, Kaur, and Roy (2023)\n\n## Inflexibility in working hours\n\nMany countries offer more flexibility in organising work hours and allow for more overtime compared to India. This is limiting the monetisable time for Indian workers and affecting their families and the country's prosperity (Roy, Saxena, and Singh, 2023). 21\n\n20    Kaur, E., Kaur, S., &amp; Roy, S.

In some cases, limits have been moved from the Law to Rules to be made by states. However, the Codes are yet to be fully operationalised and many states are found to be reintroducing the older restrictions under the new Laws.\n\nLabour Laws need to be reviewed to re-evaluate incentives for employers, with a focus on achieving better outcomes for economic growth and prosperity in the manufacturing sector. Implementing  more  flexible  labour  laws  could  unleash  substantial  economic  potential, promote gender inclusivity, and attract industrial investment.\n\n8.20  The states would also do well to reduce the compliance burden of the Micro, Small and Medium  Enterprises  (MSMEs).  The  management  bandwidth  in  MSMEs  to  grow  business, seek new markets, get funding, and hire labour is limited, and this limited bandwidth is spent disproportionately  on  compliance.  Whereas  the  Union  Government  frames  the  Rules,  the implementation or supervision is in the hands of Inspectors and Supervisors who come from the relevant departments in the states. This is where senior levels of bureaucracies at the Centre and states can and should collaborate to make it easier for businesses to comply without being squeezed out of time and other resources.\n\n## Trend in rural wages\n\n8.21  In FY24, rural wages rose at above-5 per cent every month, YoY. On an average, nominal wage rates in agriculture grew by 7.4 per cent for men and 7.7 per cent for women, benefitting from  robust  agriculture  growth  during  the  period.  The  wage  growth  in  non-agricultural\n\nactivities was relatively lower, at 6.0 per cent for men and 7.4 per cent for women during the same period. Going forward, as inflation is expected to soften with the easing of international commodity prices and domestic food prices, it is expected to translate into a sustained rise in real wages.\n\n<!-- image -->",
