The author argues that the current global approach to climate change is flawed and that India needs to follow its own path to address the problem. The chapter highlights India's achievements in reducing emission intensity and increasing non-fossil fuel-based electric capacity. It also discusses the need for a sustainable lifestyle and the importance of individual actions in addressing climate change. The author introduces the concept of Mission LiFE, a unique initiative announced by the Prime Minister of India to bring individual responsibility to the forefront of the fight against climate change. The chapter also discusses the global pursuit of energy-guzzling technologies and the need for a collective policy reflective of individual pro-planet choices. The author emphasizes the importance of public policy and not the market in undertaking the 'right' decision. The chapter concludes by highlighting the need for a philosophical shift in understanding life and the importance of mindful consumption of resources.\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Conclusion\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n13.91. The most important human factor in enlivening these principles to life is also one of the most elusive in modern life - Thahraav (Bgjko) or Settlement/Contentment that comes with Equanimity.  It is not stoppage, it is not stagnation, and it is not even a compromise. It  is  a  human's  ability  to  have  the  confidence  and  the  power  to  opt  for  internal  stability  to prepare for and accept outside change. It is only when humans can channel this energy that they can stop asking for more. It is the absence of such contentment that has made erstwhile communal things in the home become individual - e.g., television.  Things unavailable didn't cause grown men to cry and children to shrink from playing with others. This stands in contrast with the consumption-oriented living of today, where every individual is a consumer (especially children 81 ), instead of a family. That's why households, today, need more devices per person as compared to a single television earlier. Within that one statement lies the entire linkage between social mores, overconsumption, disposability, and growing mountains of trash. As per IFC, ' world generates over 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste annually 82 , and is expected to increase 70% by 2050 .'\n\n13.92.  The hunger to consume more and more means we keep missing the bus in the global discourse  on  sustainability,  by  constantly  suggesting  rewiring  the  pathways  to  renewables rather than attacking the root of the problem. Treating the symptoms to cure a growing disease.\n\n79    More  Isn't  Always  Better,  Barry  Schwartz,  Harvard  Business  Review,  June  2006  (https://hbr.org/2006/06/ more-isnt-always-better)\n\n80    Reutskaja, E., Iyengar, S., Fasolo, B., &amp; Misuraca, R.

It's time to rebuild societies with equanimity.\n\n13.94.  Internal equanimity contributes to more acceptance of others and, therefore to better human relations,  which  we  now  know,  is  also  more  conducive  to  larger,  cohesive  families, and consequently better social and sustainable impact. Access to more material choices and economic betterment shouldn't throw us so off-balance that we forget we come from Nature and must return to it. Our conscious and unconscious choices should not be divorced from the drivers of life on earth. Hence, the global movement on climate change must be accommodative of sovereign choices and economic needs, but centred on individual behaviour - 'LiFE'.\n\n********\n\n<!-- image -->",
