The country envisions a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, with Net Zero carbon emissions by 2070 guiding its interventions for high and robust economic growth. India faces challenges in balancing development needs with a low-carbon pathway. The global approach to dealing with climate change is flawed as it ignores trade-offs. Developed nations have postponed their climate-related targets, such as the UK delaying the ban on petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030 to 2035. Germany diluted its rules for banning boilers running on fossil fuels. The rise of alternative political parties in developed nations is attributed to public resistance to climate-related rules. Climate change continues to dominate policy and discourses worldwide. India's energy needs are expected to grow 2 to 2.5 times by 2047. The country aims to add 30 GW of solar capacity and reduce 720 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. India has made significant progress on climate action, achieving 40% cumulative electrical power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in 2021. The country has updated its Nationally Determined Contribution, enhancing its targets. India submitted its Third National Communication and first Adaptation Communication to the UNFCCC in December 2023. The energy sector contributed the most to overall anthropogenic emissions at 75.81%. India's GDP grew at a CAGR of about 7% between 2005 and 2019, while emissions grew at a CAGR of about 4%. The country has successfully decoupled its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. India is on track to make an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes through tree and forest cover by 2030. The country has adopted the mission-mode approach to address climate change through the National Action Plan on Climate Change. India has made significant progress in renewable energy, with a cumulative solar power capacity of 82.64 GW as of April 2024. The Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme has resulted in significant energy savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. India aims to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030 from 2005 levels. The country has launched several initiatives to improve energy efficiency, including the Energy Conservation Building Code and the Standards and Labelling program. India's energy mix is expected to change significantly, with a share of non-fossil power capacity reaching 45.4% as of May 2024. The country aims to achieve Net Zero by 2070, requiring an orderly transition to a diversified mix of energy sources. India has launched initiatives such as PM-Surya Ghar Yojana to enhance renewable energy production. The country has also notified the national offshore wind energy policy and offshore wind energy lease rules. India's Green Hydrogen Mission targets 5 MMT of green hydrogen by 2030. The electrolysis and renewable energy used as inputs are major components of green hydrogen production cost. India faces challenges in energy transition, including intermittency and discontinuous supply of renewable energy. The country needs to develop energy storage systems, including battery storage. India has announced a viability gap funding scheme for offshore wind energy projects. The country aims to triple its global renewable energy capacity and accelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power. India has emphasized the importance of energy efficiency measures in accelerating clean energy transitions. The country has implemented several measures to improve energy efficiency, including the Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme and the Standards and Labelling program. India's carbon market will allow the determination of a price for one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The country has established the Indian Carbon Market to enable a per-output emissions limit. India aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve Net Zero by 2070. The country needs to enhance international cooperation in R&D, especially in domains such as distributed RE, offshore wind, and green hydrogen. India faces challenges in accessing affordable finance for its low-carbon development pathway. The country requires an estimated USD 2.5 trillion in investments to achieve its climate goals. India has taken several measures to improve the business environment and catalyze greater quantum of resources. The country has issued sovereign green bonds to raise proceeds for public sector projects. India's Mission LiFE aims to encourage the adoption of sustainable lifestyles to address climate change. The country supports voluntary environmental actions such as the Green Credit Programme. India has led several international initiatives towards climate change mitigation and building resilience. The country has established the International Solar Alliance to deploy solar energy solutions. India aims to interconnect solar energy systems on a massive scale through the One World, One Sun, One Grid initiative. The country has launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems. India aims to achieve its ambitious growth targets while reducing carbon emissions. The country faces the dual challenge of meeting energy demands while reducing carbon emissions. India's energy needs are expected to grow significantly, and the country needs to target a diversified set of energy sources.\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# India's International Initiatives to Address Climate Change Issues\n\n## INDIA'S INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE ISSUES\n\n6.53.   India has led several international initiatives towards climate change mitigation and building resilience. Some of these are discussed as follows:\n\n1.  The International Solar Alliance (ISA) was established by a joint initiative of India and France in 2015 to deploy solar energy solutions. It is a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation with 119 Member and Signatory countries. The organisation aims to unlock USD one trillion of investments in solar by 2030 by crowding in private sector investment through guarantees, buildings capacities and through measures to reduce the cost of technology adoption. Its\n\nprogrammatic support has identified a pipeline of 9.5 GW of solar energy capacity in its member countries.  ISA  assists  in  setting  up  solar  energy  demonstration  projects  with  a grant of USD 50,000 for its Members categorised as Least Developed Countries (LDCs) or Small Island Developing States (SIDS). As of March 2024, 19 solar energy demonstration projects are under implementation. ISA also works on capacity building, and as part of this effort,  around  4,000  professionals  from  around  the  globe  have  been  trained  on  various aspects of the solar energy industry. ISA has successfully established the Solar Technology and Application Resources Centres (STAR-C) in Ethiopia and Somalia.\n\n2.  One World, One Sun, One Grid (OSOWOG) is an ambitious project led by India and the UK to interconnect solar energy systems on a massive scale. The vision behind the OSOWOG is the mantra that 'the sun never sets', and the idea is to harness solar and other renewable energy sources from different parts of the world, where the sun is shining at any given moment, and efficiently transmit that power to areas where it is needed. The OSOWOG initiative is to be carried out in three phases. In the first phase, the Indian grid would be connected to the Middle East, South Asia, and South-East Asia grids to develop a common grid. The second phase would connect the functional first phase to the pool of renewable resources in Africa, and finally, the third phase would look at achieving true global interconnection with the aim of 2,600 GW of interconnection by 2050.  77\n3.  The Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI) was launched by India during the United Nations Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019. It is a global partnership of National Governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks and financing mechanisms, the private sector, and academic and knowledge institutions that aims to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks in support of sustainable development. CDRI aims to enhance infrastructure resilience through capacity building, informed policy, planning, and management, leading to improved quality of the environment, livelihoods, and lives of over three billion people by 2050. The organisation released its first Biennial Report on Global Infrastructure Resilience in  2023.  It  is  CDRI's  contribution  towards  monitoring  the  SDGs,  the  Paris  Agreement, and the Sendai Framework targets. Other interventions include financial support for peer learning, capacity development opportunities and sectoral programs on power, transport, telecommunication, health, and urban infrastructure.  Further,  11  projects  were  awarded across 13 SIDS in 2023, in partnership with USAID and Miyamoto International, under the Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (DRI) connect, a one-stop digital knowledge exchange, learning, and co-creation platform. The Infrastructure Resilience Academic Exchange (IRAX) Programme has been conceived as a structured engagement initiative with global academic institutions  to  offer  value-added  education,  research  opportunities,  and  professional development on DRI. As part of this, in 2023, USD 5 million was provided by USAID to support a partnership between US universities and Indian higher education institutions to offer education, research, training, and professional development opportunities on DRI.  78\n\n77  One  World,  One  Sun,  One  Grid  (OSOWOG),  International  Solar  Alliance,  https://isolaralliance.org/work/ osowog/\n\n78 Based on information received from the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI)\n\n4.  The Infrastructure for Resilient Island States' (IRIS), led by India, is a flagship strategic initiative  of  CDRI  and  Small  Island  Developing  States  (SIDS)  designed  to  achieve  and deliver  resilience  and  climate  adaptation  solutions  to  the  SIDS,  which  are  among  the most vulnerable and exposed countries. Launched in 2021, IRIS is already supported by commitments of USD 35 million from Australia, India, the EU, and the UK, with a target to attract and deploy USD 50 million to support SIDS by 2030.  79\n5.  Realising the importance of partnership between the Government and industry to achieve the goal of Net Zero, the Leadership Group for Industry Transition (LeadIT) was launched by the governments of India and Sweden in September 2019. LeadIT brings together countries and companies committed to action to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. At COP 28, India and Sweden launched the second LeadIT (LeadIT 2.0) phase for 2024-26, marking a joint commitment by member countries and companies to shape policy frameworks and international cooperation for an inclusive industry transition. This new phase will focus on inclusive and just industry transition, co-development &amp; transfer of low-carbon technology, and financial support for industry transition in emerging economies.",
