This  development  has  significant  consequences  for  pay-as-you-go  pension arrangements, which rely on the next generation of taxpayers to fund the pensions paid to previous generations. In the recent past, the re-emergence of inflation has also damaged the community's  confidence  in  the  ability  of  pension  programs  to  deliver  adequate  retirement benefits over the longer term. Although inflation has declined in some economies, its persistence has highlighted this risk to current and future retirees. At the same time, there is an ongoing global shift away from defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) arrangements, in which individuals carry all risks relating to investment returns, inflation and, often, longevity. Very few systems have solved the dilemma of moving from an individual-based DC accumulation system to a post-retirement system that provides adequate and secure income to retirees while providing them the same flexibility available during their working years.\n\n2.110  An ongoing challenge facing many pension systems is the inclusion of gig workers and those  in  the  informal  labour  market.  In  many  economies,  the  labour  market  is  fracturing; therefore, the stable or structured employer-employee relationship is disappearing. In such circumstances, pension arrangements must become more individually focused and less reliant on third parties. 76\n\n74 https://tinyurl.com/98vs72dc\n\n75 'Insurance industry needs a regulatory shake-up', Business Line, 10th February 2024 (https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ opinion/insurance-industry-needs-a-regulatory-shake-up/article67829954.ece)\n\n76 International  Labour  Organisation,  'Non-Standard  Employment  Around  the  World:  Understanding  challenges,  shaping prospects', https://tinyurl.com/3uah4a4n\n\n## Performance of India's Pension Sector\n\n2.111  According to the 15th Annual Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index (MCGPI) 77 , India's  overall  global  pension  index  value  improved  from  44.5  in  2022  to  45.9  in  2023, primarily due to an improvement in adequacy and sustainability sub-indices. India's pension system  comprises  an  earnings-related  employee  pension  scheme,  a  defined  contribution Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and supplementary employer-managed pension schemes that are essentially by way of DC. Changes in workforce dynamics, employment, and family patterns have brought formal sources of retirement to the forefront. While there is improvement in the net  pension replacement rate and participation in private pension plans, which is reflected in the value of adequacy and sustainability sub-indices, the coverage of the Indian workforce under private pension plans is yet to be enhanced. 78 The Government has launched various schemes as part of the universal social security programme to benefit the unorganised sector.\n\n2.112  India's pension sector has expanded since the introduction of the National Pension Scheme (NPS) and, more recently, the Atal Pension Yojana (APY). The total number of subscribers stood at 735.6 lakh as of March 2024, registering a YoY growth of 18 per cent from 623.6 lakh as of March 2023. The total number of APY subscribers (including its earlier version, NPS Lite) increased from 501.2 lakh as of March 2023 to 588.4 lakh as of March 2024. APY subscribers account for around 80 per cent of the pension subscriber base. 79\n\n2.113  Disaggregated  data  of  the  Pension  Fund  Regulatory  and  Development  Authority  of India (PFRDA) shows that APY subscribers have witnessed an improvement in gender mix, with female subscriber share rising from 37.2 per cent in FY17 to 48.5 per cent in FY23. The age mix is increasing also in favour of the younger cohort in the age group of 18-25, from a share of 35 per cent in FY17 to 46.7 per cent in FY23 However, the bulks, about 92 per cent, of APY accounts are for a pension amount of ₹1,000 per month, followed by 4.7 per cent for ₹5,000. The overwhelming share of ₹1,000 pension in APY could be due to several factors, the predominant cause being that the target population is low-income households where day-today consumption expenditure takes precedence over savings. 80\n\n2.114  The population's pension coverage under these two schemes (NPS &amp; APY) as a share of the total population has increased from 1.2 per cent in FY17 to 5.3 per cent in FY24. AuM under these schemes as a proportion of GDP has risen from 1.1 per cent in FY17 to 4 per cent in FY24.\n\n## Outlook for the Pension Sector\n\n2.115  In the future, NPS (private sector) is poised to expand rapidly as an increasing number of corporate employees and relatively better-off households, for example, self-employed and\n\n77 The Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index benchmarks 47 retirement income systems around the world, highlighting challenges and opportunities within each. The index is made up of three sub-indices, adequacy, sustainability, and integrity that measure each retirement income system against more than 50 indicators\n\n78 Presently, 6 per cent of the Indian workforce is covered under private pension plans, as per the 15th Annual MCGPI.\n\n79  https://www.pfrda.org.in/\n\n80 Monthly Pension Bulletins of PFRDA, https://www.pfrda.org.in\n\nprofessionals such as doctors, lawyers, and small business owners, see the merit of joining NPS. There is a potential for NPS in rural areas for larger farmers, traders, and those with lumpy incomes, as it does not require a standard monthly contribution.\n\n2.116  There is a tremendous scope for growth as India's per capita income rises further and transitions  to  a  high-middle-income  country.  India's  demographic  structure,  with  a  more significant proportion of younger people, favours a phase of accumulation. Since life expectancy is inching up, the need for a steady income stream is also increasing to mitigate old-age poverty. Further, as the traditional family support system changes with growing urbanisation, there is even a greater necessity for an independent source of income in old age.\n\n2.117  Financial literacy becomes essential for people to reap the benefits of the formal financial sector. There are many facets to pension literacy; women in the family must have a pension account  given  their  higher  longevity;  it  is  prudent  to  empower  young  adults,  particularly students,  with  a  pension  account  so  that  they  imbibe  the  financial  discipline  of  long-term saving.\n\n2.118  Financial inclusion and empowerment will only be complete with each family member's pension account. In this direction, given the nature of the pension product where the payoff is  not  immediate,  it  needs  a  nudge  by  all  concerned,  the  employers,  intermediaries,  the Government, and the pension regulator, to induce people, particularly young adults, to join a  pension scheme. There is immense merit in joining young as, with small contributions, a sizeable corpus could be accumulated given the power of compounding, providing substantial steady income in one's post-working life.\n\n## Mechanisms to ensure regulatory coordination and overall financial stability\n\n2.119  The  financial  system's  stability  is  paramount  for  sustainable  economic  growth  and prosperity.  A  financially  stable  system  should  be  robust  to  macroeconomic  disturbances.  It should withstand unforeseen shocks so that there is a high degree of confidence that it will continue  to  meet  its  contractual  obligations.  Financial  stability  means  not  only  an  absence of actual crisis but also the ability of the system to limit and manage imbalances before they assume a magnitude that threatens itself or the economic processes.\n\n2.120 The role of the Government in ensuring financial stability is multifaceted and crucial. Governments worldwide employ various policies, regulations, and measures to safeguard the integrity and smooth functioning of the financial sector. It would also be essential to assess how financial instability interacts with the real economy to either amplify or moderate the effects of initial shocks. Thus, regulators responsible for oversight of different financial institutions must interact and cooperate closely among themselves and with those responsible for the stability of prices and the real economy.\n\n2.121  In the Indian context, the Financial Sector Development Council (FSDC) 81 is a forum that facilitates interaction among various financial sector regulators.  It  is mandated to deal with a wide range of issues relating to financial stability, financial sector development, inter-regulatory coordination, financial literacy and financial inclusion, macro-prudential supervision of the economy,  including  the  functioning  of  large  financial  conglomerates,  coordinating  India's international interface with financial sector bodies (like Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Financial Stability Board (FSB)) and any other matter relating to the financial sector stability and development referred by a Member/Chairperson and considered prudent by the Council.\n\n2.122 Under the FSDC, the FSDC sub-committee (FSDC-SC) is a forum chaired by the RBI Governor  which  deliberate  on  agenda  items  proposed  by  any  of  the  members  along  with supportive  actions  required.  Further,  the  RBI  promotes  the  financial  sector's  resilience  by regulating  financial  institutions,  monitoring  systemic  risks,  and  implementing  monetary policy. The collective assessment of the risks to financial stability and the strength of the Indian financial system is undertaken and reported in the bi-annual Financial Stability Report (FSR) published by RBI since March 2010. 82\n\n## Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) for India\n\n2.123 FSAP is the quinquennial exercise jointly conducted by the IMF and the World Bank in countries having 'systemically important' financial sectors. FSAP involves a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of a country's financial industry to assess financial stability and financial sector development. India underwent its first FSAP exercise in 2011-12 and the second one in 2017, after which IMF-World Bank published its reports, including the Financial System Stability Assessment Report (FSSA) and Financial Sector Assessment (FSA) report. The third FSAP exercise for India is underway for 2023-24. The FSSA and FSA reports will be published by February 2025.FSB publishes its annual report on the Implementation and effects of the G20 financial regulatory reforms, mentioning implementation status across various jurisdictions. The colour-coded template in the report 83 highlights the extent of sectoral implementation of FSB Principles and Standards. The monitored priority areas include (i)Basel-III reforms, (ii) Compensation, (iii) Over-the-Counter (OTC) derivatives, (iv)Resolution, and (v) Non-Banking Financial Intermediation (NBFI).\n\n2.124 Implementation of Basel III Reforms 84 has  supported  resiliency  in  both  the  domestic and global banking sectors. Under Basel III pillars reforms, India is largely compliant as it has laid down provisions for Net Stable Funding Ratio, liquidity coverage ratio, requirements for\n\n81 The Minister of Finance chairs the FSDC.

India  is  also  in  the  process of  implementing the other two requirements under Basel III, that is, revised leverage ratio requirements and risk-based capital framework.\n\n2.125 For the compensation pillar, India already has in place Standards for Sound Compensation Practices  (Principles  and  Standards)  for  significant  banks,  insurers,  and  asset  managers  in India.\n\n2.126 Under  the  OTC  derivatives  segment,  India  made  significant  progress  in  2023  from the 2022 FSB assessment, as more than 90 per cent of the OTC derivatives now follow trade reporting, central clearing and platform trading requirements under FSB principles. The fourth parameter under the OTC pillar, that is, margin requirements concerning OTC derivatives, is currently under implementation.\n\n2.127  Enhancing the resilience of NBFI is an important priority of FSB, which under key reforms area is bucketed under Money Market Mutual Funds, Securitisation and Securities Financing Transactions (SFT) requirements.  India is the only jurisdiction among 24 reported by FSB in total compliance with SFT requirements including minimum regulatory standards for collateral valuation and management, numerical haircut floors on bank-to-non-bank transactions, etc. India has actively undertaken securitisation and MMFs reforms in line with FSB principles.\n\n## Financial System Stress Indicator\n\n2.128 The RBI, in the 26th issue of its FSR 85 , attempted to compile a comprehensive indicator called the financial system stress indicator (FSSI) 86 to monitor the aggregate stress level in the Indian financial system. FSSI aims to (a) help identify periods of stress, (b) assess the intensity and duration of stress in the financial system, and (c) gauge the ability of financial markets and intermediaries to withstand shocks and imbalances.\n\n2.129 The latest FSR of June 2024 shows that FSSI indicated a gradual easing of stress during H2 of FY24. The decline in stress indicators has been broad-based, except for the NBFC and money market segments. The decline in government debt market stress was the primary contributor to the improvement in the overall FSSI, aided by a fall in long-term yields as well as volatility and higher net foreign portfolio debt inflows. Meanwhile, declining volatility and rangebound movement in the exchange rate reduced stress levels in the foreign exchange market. Money market stress indicators inched up as tight liquidity in the banking system led to higher interest rates on money market instruments (e.g., Commercial Papers and Certificate of Deposits). The banking system stress indicator remained subdued, supported by improving soundness. The real\n\n85  26th issue of the RBI Financial Stability Report, December 2022, page 56, https://t.ly/o\\_CZb.\n\n86 The FSSI features risk factors about five financial market segments-equity, foreign exchange, money, government debt and corporate debt markets and three groups of financial intermediary segments, namely, banks, NBFCs and AMC-MFs. It also features a real sector component encompassing select real sector variables that have a bearing on financial stability due to their strong interlinkages with the financial sector.

Stress indicators for the NBFC sector rose as their capital ratios dipped and spreads on their borrowing costs increased.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;",
