Despite facing various challenges, the sector has emerged strongly from the pandemic, driven by policy and procedural reforms, physical infrastructure development, and a shift towards digital services. The chapter provides an overview of the services sector's performance, highlighting key trends, challenges, and opportunities.\\n\\n### Performance of the Services Sector\\n\\n- **Contribution to GDP**: The services sector contributed about 55% to India's total GDP in FY24.\\n- **Growth Rate**: The sector witnessed a real growth rate of more than 6% in all years of the last decade except in FY21, which was affected by the pandemic.\\n- **Services Exports**: India's services exports constituted 4.4% of the world's commercial services exports in 2022.\\n\\n### Segments of the Services Sector\\n\\nThe services sector can be broadly classified into two categories: contact-intensive and non-contact-intensive services. The former includes trade, hospitality, transport, real estate, and social, community, and personal services. The latter comprises financial, information technology, professional, communication, broadcasting, and storage services.\\n\\n### Policy and Procedural Reforms\\n\\nThe Government has played a crucial role in fostering the growth and competitiveness of India's services sector through enabling policies, promoting investment, enhancing skills, and facilitating market access. Initiatives like the Digital India campaign, export promotion schemes, and skill development programs have been pivotal.\\n\\n### Financial Flows into the Services Sector\\n\\n- **Bank Credit**: The services sector witnessed an upward trajectory of credit inflow, with a YoY growth rate surpassing 20% each month since April 2023, reaching an outstanding credit of â‚¹45.9 lakh crore in March 2024.\\n- **FDI and ECBs**: The sector received significant foreign direct investment (FDI) and external commercial borrowings (ECBs), with India ranking 15th in terms of FDI inflow in 2023.\\n\\n### Major Services: Sector-wise Performance\\n\\n#### Physical Connectivity-based Services\\n\\n- **Transportation Services**: The sector showed substantial growth, with passenger traffic originating in Indian Railways increasing by 5.2% and freight loadings growing by 5.3% in FY24.\\n- **Roadways**: Digitalization of toll collection reduced waiting times at toll plazas from 734 seconds in 2014 to 47 seconds in 2024.\\n- **Indian Railways**: Introduced Wi-Fi facilities at 6108 stations and digitized maintenance of locomotives, coaches, and wagons.\\n\\n#### Information Technology Services\\n\\n- **Growth**: The IT and IT-enabled services sector achieved a real growth rate of 10.4% in FY21 and is expected to grow further.\\n- **Global Capability Centres (GCCs)**: India has over 1,580 GCCs, employing more than 16.6 lakh people, with revenue increasing to USD 46 billion in FY23.\\n\\n#### Tourism\\n\\n- **Growth**: The tourism sector witnessed over 92 lakh foreign tourist arrivals in 2023, a YoY increase of 43.5%, with foreign exchange earnings rising by 65.7%.\\n- **Rankings**: India ranked 39th in the World Economic Forum's Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) 2024.\\n\\n#### Real Estate\\n\\n- **Growth**: Residential real estate sales in India grew by 33% YoY in 2023, with new supply hitting a high of 5.2 lakh units.\\n- **Regulatory Framework**: The Real Estate (Regulation & Development) Act, 2016 (RERA), has brought transparency and accountability to the sector.\\n\\n### Challenges and Opportunities\\n\\n- **Skill Gap**: There is a gap in the availability of workers with relevant digital and high-tech skills.\\n- **Logistics and Transport**: Initiatives to ease infrastructure bottlenecks and leverage India's coastline and river network for enhanced services.\\n- **Access to Finance**: Difficulty in accessing finance, particularly for small and medium enterprises, with initiatives like Mudra Yojana and Start-up India.\\n- **Regulatory Landscape**: Positive transformations with GST simplification and sector-specific policies.\\n\\n### Conclusion and Way Forward\\n\\nThe services sector is pivotal for India's economic growth and job creation. Sustaining positive demand trends, managing costs, and enhancing skills are critical. The sector's growth and resilience will depend on effectively navigating global economic uncertainties and competitive pressures. Collaboration between the government, industry stakeholders, and international partners is essential to realize the sector's potential.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Conclusion and Way Forward\n\n## CONCLUSION AND WAY FORWARD\n\n11.74 Historically, India's services sector has thrived on low-cost offerings. The digitisation of services, coupled with appropriate policy nudges, kept progressively transforming the nature of service delivery almost irreversibly during the early part of the last decade. This trend accelerated post the pandemic. Another distinct pattern that emerged during the last three years is that the contact-intensive business and personal services-prominently trade, transport, real estate and their ancillary services - that underwent a steep decline during the pandemic are recovering, embedding greater technology and digital content in them. At the same time, India's services exports are diversifying beyond software to include Human Resources (HR), legal, and design services  in  line  with  emerging  global  demands.  Thus,  two  significant  transformations  are reshaping India's services landscape: the rapid technology-driven transformation of domestic service delivery and the diversification of India's services exports.\n\n11.75 The country is emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres. Domestically, start-ups drive innovation, improving access to credit, raw materials, and markets. Aided by the deep technology ecosystem and the consistent policy push, many technology start-ups are digitising manufacturing and other services. The embedded service content of the non-service economic activities  has  increased  significantly,  as  evidenced  by  the  National  Accounts  Statistics.  The post-production  value  addition  in  activities  is  also  increasingly  dependent  on  services  like e-commerce, innovative packaging and advertisement and modern logistics services.\n\n11.76 As India looks forward to creating millions of jobs by 2030, dovetailing this transformation in the demand-supply dynamics of services is pivotal to meeting the hiring requirements in the medium term. The emerging job demands in the services sector entail greater and more focussed  skills.  The  World  Economic  Forum's  report 52   highlights  an  increasing  focus  on cognitive abilities (like complex problem-solving and creative thinking), digital literacy, and proficiency in AI and big data. This shift underscores the strategic imperative for businesses and the workforce to adapt to technological advancements and meet global market demands. Focus areas should include blockchain, AI, machine learning, Internet of Things, cybersecurity, cloud computing, big data analytics, augmented reality, virtual reality, 3D printing, and web and mobile development. Thus, the immediate task of the skilling programme in India is to\n\n52    World Economic Forum. (2023). WEF Future of Jobs 2023 (Page 7). https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF\\_ Future\\_of\\_Jobs\\_2023.pdf\n\nplan and equip itself to meet these requirements adequately. A report by Capital Economics argues that AI could lead to a slowing down of India's services export growth, cutting it by 0.30.4 percentage points a year over the next decade. 53  This only underscores the importance of the relatively less skill-dependent tourism sector for employment generation. Therefore, public policy should pay particular attention to boosting the tourism sector. Governments at all levels and the private sector must work together to realise the sector's potential. 54\n\n11.77 In the short run, tentative global economic outlook and commodity price uncertainties present a serious challenge to input costs and demand for services 55 . Thus, sustaining positive demand trends and effectively managing rising costs and competitive pressures will be critical for  the  services  sector's  continued  growth  and  resilience  in  the  upcoming  year.  The  postpandemic dynamism shown by the economy and the services sector, in particular, should help transcend these uncertainties and challenges.\n\n********\n\n53    The Economist (24 June 2024).Will services make the world rich?  https://www.economist.com/finance-andeconomics/2024/06/24/will-services-make-the-world-rich\n\n54    Hotel  Association  of  India  &amp;  Benori  Knowledge.

So, pressure on commodity prices can significantly affect the input cost of services and, hence, their demand.",
