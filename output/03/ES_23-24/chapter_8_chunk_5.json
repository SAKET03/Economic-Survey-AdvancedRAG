The human resources who bring about this progression must also adapt to it to be employable in the changed scenario. The global labour market is amid a 'disruption,' constantly being reshaped by the fourth industrial revolution, concerted efforts by all economies to decarbonise in the wake of a looming climate crisis and other geopolitical vicissitudes. In a recent study, David Autor 22  wrote that changes in the nature of work in the last few decades-primarily technological-have been more disruptive and less beneficial for non-college workers.\n\n8.23  According to the World Economic Forum's (WEF) Future of Jobs report, 2023 23 , in the next five years, 23 per cent of the jobs are expected to change globally. This change is likely to consist of growth in 10.2 per cent of the jobs and decline in 12.3 per cent of the jobs. Employers anticipate 69 million new jobs to be created and 83 million eliminated - a net decrease of 14 million jobs, or 2 per cent of current employment. The following are some ways in which the work environment is evolving.\n\n## Fourth industrial revolution\n\n8.24  Epochal changes in the economic structures manifested by three Industrial Revolutions (IR), starting from the 18 th   century, have caused technological disruption and significant job displacement. Each has resulted in transformations in the manner in which firms and individuals interact with the labour markets, redefining the relationship between technology and how work gets done. 24  Each IR caused a significant loss of livelihood for workers whose tasks were most susceptible to automation and those who could not quickly adapt to new technology. People have had to skill and reskill to maintain their place in the labour markets.\n\n8.25  The world is in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution characterised by novel ways in which technology is becoming embedded within societies through 'cyber-physical systems,' Internet of Things (IoT), big data, nano-technology, and networks. Evolving forms of machine learning,  AI,  blockchains,  genetic  engineering,  quantum  computing,  advanced  analytics, automation, and advanced manufacturing technology are some examples of what constitutes this  technological  revolution.  In  the  backdrop  of  this  evolving  revolution,  the  future  of  job markets in India is undergoing a significant transformation, as is happening in the rest of the world.\n\n8.26  The demand for digital roles is proliferating, hastened further by the COVID-19 pandemic and its lingering impact. Technological advancements are leading to a growing demand for tech-savvy professionals trained in emerging areas such as big data, AI and machine learning, cybersecurity,  cloud  computing,  etc.  According  to  the  WEF,  the  fastest-growing  jobs  in  the next five years will be those of AI and machine learning specialists, sustainability specialists,\n\n22 David\tAutor\t(2019),\t'Work\tof\tthe\tPast,\tWork\tof\tthe\tFuture',\tNBER\tWorking\tPaper\tNo.\t25588\thttp://www.nber. org/papers/w25588.\n\n23    https://www.weforum.org/publications/the-future-of-jobs-report-2023/\n\n24    For instance, Didier, N. (2024). Turning fragments into a lens: Technological change, industrial revolutions, and labor. Technology in Society , 77 ,  102497,  present  how  the  labour  market  has  evolved  in  the  context  of technological change.\n\nbusiness intelligence analysts and information security specialists; the largest absolute growth is expected in education, agriculture, and digital commerce.\n\n## Disruptions due to the adoption of AI\n\n8.27  The  biggest  disruption  for  the  future  of  work  is  the  accelerated  growth  in  AI,  which is  poised  to  revolutionise  the  global  economy.  India  would  not  remain  immune  to  this transformation. AI is being recognised as a general-purpose technology, like electricity and the internet, which is phenomenal in its rapid pace of innovation and ease of diffusion. As AI systems continue to get smarter and adoption increases, the future of work will be reshaped. While AI has considerable potential for boosting productivity, it also has the potential to disrupt employment in certain sectors. Routine tasks, including customer service, will likely witness a high degree of automation; creative sectors will see extensive usage of AI tools for image and video creation; personalised AI tutors can reshape education and sectors like healthcare can witness accelerated drug discovery. On the impact of AI on employment, insights can be drawn from Acemoglu and Johnson's work, presented in Box VIII.3.\n\n## Box VIII.3: Ricardo's Pivot and the Centrality of Technological Choices\n\nConventional  economic  wisdom  would  suggest  that  technological  changes  generate productivity 25  gains leading to higher wages and more economic opportunities in the long run. However, according to Acemoglu and Johnson (2024) 26 , 'â€¦ taking such a long view ignores the struggles of workers to secure their fair share of prosperity made possible by the new machinery.' The authors take a cue from Industrial Revolution in Britain to understand the relationship between AI-induced rise in productivity and employment in the present. Specifically, the authors take the examples of automation of cotton spinning through the introduction of the spinning jenny in the late 18 th  century, automation of weaving by the power loom in the 19 th  century, and the advent of the railways and heavy industries in the second half of 19 th century.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpinning Jenny 27\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPower loom in a factory 28\n\n25    Productivity refers to how much output can be produced with a given set of inputs. Productivity increases when more output is produced with the same amount of inputs or when the same amount of output is produced with less inputs.\n\n26    Acemoglu, Daron and Johnson, Simon, Learning from Ricardo and Thompson: Machinery and Labor in the Early Industrial Revolution, and in the Age of Ai (May 2024). NBER Working Paper No. w32416, SSRN: https:// ssrn.com/abstract=4826001.\n\n- 27    Source: https://kids.britannica.com/students/article/spinning-jenny/630347\n- 28    Source: https://historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=42\n\nWhile spinning jennies reduced the cost of yarn and increased the productivity and demand of handloom weavers, the power loom led to labour substitution and halving of real wage of artisans between 1806 and 1820. The decline in real wages of weavers after the arrival of power\tloom\tis\tsaid\tto\tbe\tbehind\tRicardo's\tchange\tin\topinion\tfrom\t' machinery did not lessen the demand for labour '\tin\t1819\tto\t' If machinery could do all the work that labour now does, there would be no demand for labour' in 1821. Likewise, the coming of the Liverpool and Manchester railways in 1830 spurred new jobs in modern manufacturing, including design, repair, maintenance, and clerical tasks.\n\nThe authors highlight the inadequacy of economic factors to explain the impact of automation on wages and emphasise on the forces of political economy, i.e., the balance of power between labour and capital. Here, the interpretation of E.P. Thompson, an English historian, seems more suitable to them in explaining the impact of power loom on weavers. According to Thompson, the movement of workers to factories led to their loss of autonomy, and, in the absence of any policy support or bargaining power, culminated in the deterioration of wages and worker conditions.\n\nIn  simple  words,  it  is  how  we  use  the  technology-  whether  we  use  it  for  automation, surveillance and control or we use it for informed decision making, problem-solving and augmentation 29 , that decides whether AI will facilitate the path of job creation or will be a hindrance to it. During Ricardo's time, this choice was made by the factory owners, employers and industrialists while labourers underwent harsh working conditions, surveillance and control. Times have changed now, workers are certainly more independent, and hold power through strict labour laws and trade unions. Several reports today mention that AI will not destroy jobs rather transform them. Studies emphasise the need for humans to guide this AI transition. 30 31\n\nThe paper concludes that automation may be good or bad, depending on how we deploy it, and the direction of the technology being implemented. New technology can hurt labour interests by reducing the marginal productivity of labour 32  while overall productivity may rise, thereby leading to substitution of labour by machines, as in the case of the handloom weavers. At the same time, automation can benefit labour in two ways. Firstly, if it significantly increases the marginal productivity of labour in the right sectors thereby increasing labour demand in non-automated tasks or in industries producing complementary products, as in the case of jennies. Secondly, when automation is accompanied by creation of new tasks and increase in marginal productivity of labour in new activities like in the railways example (Acemoglu and Johnson 2023). That said, political economy remains decisive in ensuring shared  prosperity  from  technology.  This  is  termed  as  the  'centrality  of  technological choices'.\n\n29    https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ai-automation-threatens-workers-lessons-from-industrialrevolution-and-david-ricardo-by-daron-acemoglu-and-simon-johnson-2024-04\n\n30    https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/generative-ai-likely-augment-rather-destroy-jobs\n\n31    https://hbr.org/2021/11/automation-doesnt-just-create-or-destroy-jobs-it-transforms-them\n\n32    The marginal product(ivity) of labour is defined as the amount that output would be increased if one more unit of labour were employed, while everything else remains the same.\n\n8.28  Research done in the context of the US informs that Generative AI (GenAI) may have a  far  higher  impact  on  reshaping  jobs  than  replacing  jobs. 33  According to IMF (2023) 34  and IMF (2024) 35 , almost 40 per cent of global employment is exposed to AI, with the exposure of advanced economies being 60 per cent due to the prevalence of cognitive-task-oriented jobs. The study develops an index of potential AI complementarity, which suggests that about half of these may be negatively affected by AI. At the same time, the rest could benefit from enhanced productivity through AI integration. It finds that employment highly exposed to AI is 26 per cent for India, divided into 14 per cent for occupations with high complementarity and 12 per cent for those with low complementarity. 36 37\n\n8.29  India, with its vast demographic dividend and a very young population, is uniquely situated as AI poses both risk and opportunity. According to Capital Economics (2024), the current diffusion and adaptation of AI in India remains low compared to US, Europe, and the developed Asian economies. Manufacturing sector is less exposed to AI as industrial robots are neither as nimble nor as cost-effective as human labour. In inventory and supply chain management, AI applications could rather be complementary to labour. Nevertheless, at particular risk is the  BPO  sector,  where  GenAI  is  revolutionising  the  performance  of  routine  cognitive  tasks through chatbots, and employment in the sector is estimated to decline considerably in the next ten years. In the following decade, however, gradual diffusion of AI is expected to augment productivity. Uses of AI to identify health risks out of digitalised health data, predict weather, and complementing teachers in grading tests and translating texts are some of the development gaps that AI can plug. 38\n\n8.30  Widespread adoption of AI across the services sector can significantly reshape and even replace jobs. Based on job postings data from India's largest job website, Copestake, A. et. al. (2023) interpret a near-exponential increase in the demand for AI-related skills since 2016. They find that the demand for AI skills by businesses has a negative impact on the need for nonAI roles and on the top percentile of wages, due to the displacement of high-skilled, managerial positions and non-routine, intellectual tasks. 39\n\n8.31  Given the affinity of India's population to work with technology, as seen with the digital public infrastructure, proactive interventions by the Government and industry can position India  as  a  key  player  in  the  AI  age.  Employees  or  job  seekers  would  need  skills  beyond communication, collaboration, and presentation, such as analytical thinking and innovation;\n\n33    Forrester's 2023 Generative AI Jobs Impact Forecast, US, https://www.forrester.com/report/forresters-2023generative-ai-jobs-impact-forecast-us/RES179790.\n\n34 Pizzinelli,\tC.,\tA.\tPanton,\tM.\tM.\tTavares,\tM.\tCazzaniga,\tand\tL.\tLi,\t(2023)\t'Labor\tMarket\tExposure\tto\tAI:\tCrosscountry Differences and Distributional Implication.'

This gap highlights the need for research and development in this sector. The AI related research papers published by China in 2019 were 102,161, followed by 74,386 in US and 23,398 in India, which is less than one-fourth of China. Outputs in AI Research and Development are highly skewed, with concentration in only a few countries. 40 41\n\n8.33  The US, being the leader in the AI R&amp;D output, has clearly laid out a well-defined strategic plan to strengthen its AI sector. The plan consists of 9 steps, as mentioned in the latest 2023 report by its National Science and Technology Council 42 , i.e., making long-term investments in  AI  Research,  developing  effective  methods  for  human-AI  collaboration,  understanding and addressing implications of AI , ensuring the safety and security of AI systems, developing datasets for AI training and testing, measuring and evaluating AI systems, better understand national  AI  R&amp;D  workforce  needs,  expanding  private-public  partnerships,  and  establishing a coordinated approach to international collaboration in AI Research. This strategy marks a significant move of the US Government to address the challenges that cannot be resolved by the sectors alone.\n\n8.34  A  policy  brief  by  Research  and  Information  System  for  Developing  Countries  (RIS) suggested that there is a need for an Inter-Agency Coordination Authority for AI which would act as a central institution guiding the research, decision-making, policy planning on AI and job creation. 43  The brief also suggested that AI will create more jobs but may have a negative short-term impact, and to counter this impact there is a need to invest in capacity building, upskilling, training, and forming policies to ensure that low-skilled workers do not suffer from any potential job losses.\n\n8.35  AI  has  made  a  significant  growth  in  the  agri-tech,  industry  &amp;  automotive,  healthcare, BFSI and retail sectors in India. One of the significant examples include Praman Exchange, world's largest horticulture exchange, powered by Intello Labs which uses computer vision to map the quality of horticulture products. Pramaan's technology achieves quality assessment with 95 per cent accuracy, surpassing the manual assessment rate of 70 per cent. This gives the contractors the required time and flexibility to trade from anywhere in the world. 44\n\n40    https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/2e658ef2144a05f30e254221ccaf7a42-0200022021/original/DDAnalytical-Insights-Note-4.pdf\n\n41    https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03409-8 (Savage 2020)\n\n42    National  Science  and  Technology  Council  |  The  White  House  https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/ uploads/2023/05/National-Artificial-Intelligence-Research-and-Development-Strategic-Plan-2023-Update. pdf\n\n43    https://www.ris.org.in/sites/default/files/Publication/Policy%20brief-104\\_Amit%20Kumar.pdf\n\n44    https://www.investindia.gov.in/team-india-blogs/artificial-intelligence-powering-indias-growth-story\n\n8.36  The Government has launched several initiatives to ensure an AI enabled ecosystem and to connect AI to the youth of the country. Some of these include 'Future Skills Prime', 'YUVAi: Youth for Unnati and Vikas with AI' a national programme for school students and 'Responsible AI for Youth 2022' 45 .\t A\tbudget\tof\tâ‚¹10,300\tcrore\thas\tbeen\tprovided\tin\t2024\tfor\tthe\tIndia\tAI Mission, a significant move to strengthen the AI ecosystem. 46\n\n## Shift towards gig economy\n\n8.37  A  marked shift in the employment scenario has led to the rise of the gig economy globally.  It  encompasses  freelancers,  online  platform  workers,  self-employed,  on-call workers, and creative tech talent. In India, the rise of the gig economy is driven by the emergence of tech-enabled platforms, an increase in access to the internet backed by the development of digital public infrastructure, the demand for flexible work arrangements, and the focus on skills. According to NITI Aayog's indicative estimates based on national labour force survey data, in 2020-21, 77 lakh (7.7 million) workers were engaged in the gig economy. They constituted 2.6 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce or 1.5 per cent of the total workforce in India. 47\n\n8.38  Research studies have shown that participation in the gig economy is higher in developing countries  (between  five  and  12  per  cent)  compared  to  developed  economies  (between  one and four per cent), and most of these jobs are in lower-income job types, such as deliveries, ridesharing,  microtasks,  care  and  wellness  (BCG  2021). 48 The  continuing  high  demand  for such services and job flexibility is boosting entry-level job creation in tier-2 and tier-3 cities, including part-time work for students entering the job market or as a shock absorber in case of temporary unemployment, with a high probability of workers moving to better-paying jobs after the platform experience (NCAER 2023). 49\n\n8.39  The gig workforce is expected to expand to 2.35 crore (23.5 million) by 2029-30. Gig workers are expected to form 6.7 per cent per cent of the non-agricultural workforce or 4.1 per cent of the total livelihood in India by 2029-30. 50  While the gig economy may open up employment  opportunities  for  various  sections  of  workers,  including  youth,  persons  with disabilities,  and  women, a significant issue in the Indian context and globally has been the creation of effective social security initiatives for gig and platform workers. The Code on Social Security (2020) marks a significant advancement by expanding the scope of social security benefits to encompass gig and platform workers.\n\n## Climate change and green energy transition\n\n8.40  With climate change a hard reality of the present times and projections pointing towards an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, the concomitant outcome is the possible loss of jobs and productivity. Heat is an occupational safety and health hazard. According  to  the  International  Labour  Organization  (ILO),  projections  based  on  a  global\n\n45 Parliament\tQuestion\t'Impact\tof\tAI'\thttps://labour.gov.in/sites/default/files/pib2002657.pdf\n\n46    PIB https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2012375\n\n47    NITI Aayog, June 2022, India's Booming Gig and Platform Economy\n\n48 BCG\treport\t'Unlocking\tthe\tpotential\tof\tGig\tEconomy\tin\tIndia'\tIndia-Gig-Economy-Report.pdf\t(bcg.com)\n\n49    NCAER, August 2023, Socio-economic Impact Assessment of Food Delivery Platform Workers\n\n50    Ibid. footnote 47\n\ntemperature rise of 1.5Â°C by the end of the 21 st  century and also on labour force trends suggest that in 2030,3.8 per cent of total working hours worldwide will be lost to high temperatures - the equivalent of 136 million full-time jobs- and economic losses of $2,400 billion. 51  The Report notes that India is one of the most vulnerable countries to productivity losses, given its  high share of agricultural and construction employment and location within the tropical latitude.\n\n8.41  Another aspect of climate change is the efforts to mitigate its impact by adopting green technologies and transitioning to greener energy alternatives. This trend is leading to businesses witnessing a strong job-creation effect driven by investments that facilitate the green transition of businesses and the application of ESG standards.\n\n8.42  For  instance,  India's  green  transition  is  and  is  more  likely  to  significantly  impact  job opportunities  in  the  renewable  energy  sector.  Tyagi  et  al  (2021) 52 observes  that,  by  2030, clean energy initiatives can potentially create about 3.4 million jobs (short and long-term) by installing 238 GW of solar and 101 GW of new wind capacity to achieve the 500 GW non-fossil electricity generation capacity. These jobs represent those created in the wind and on-grid solar energy sectors. About one million can be employed to take up these green jobs. 53\n\n8.43  Climate change also affects worker well-being, as highlighted in a recent ILO report 54 , creating  a  'cocktail'  of  health  hazards  for  70  per  cent  of  the  world's  workforce.  Workers, especially  those  in  manual  jobs,  thus  need  suitably  designed  policy  support  and  private insurance products to protect their health and incomes from the vagaries of heatwaves, floods, cyclones, etc. Here, an innovative pilot programme by Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) is noteworthy. Launched in 2023, a heat-linked parametric insurance covering 22,000 unorganised workers entails partial wage payment when temperature breaches 43.6 0  C with the premium borne partially by the worker and rest through charity. By helping the workers to cover food and medication requirement, the payout provides a shield against the scorching heat. Ultimately, SEWA plans to sign up 29 lakh members which would allow the premiums to be fully funded by the workers themselves. 55\n\n8.44  To sum up, as the country navigates the complexities of the future job market alongside the  global  trends,  as  discussed  above,  acceptance  and  adapting  to  change  and  encouraging innovation  will  be  the  key  to  harnessing  the  opportunities  and  dealing  with  the  challenges presented before us. Dwelling deeper into these trends in the job markets and finding costeffective  solutions  through  careful  planning  and  implementation  would  go  a  long  way  in mitigating the negative impacts on the job's ecosystem.\n\n51    ILO (2019), Working on a warmer planet: The impact of heat stress on labour productivity and decent work. https://tinyurl.com/axn9bx8z\n\n52    Tyagi, Akanksha and others (2021).
