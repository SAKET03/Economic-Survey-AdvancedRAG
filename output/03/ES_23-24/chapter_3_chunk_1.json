  "content": "Chapter 3 Summary:\nThe chapter discusses India's inflation management, focusing on prices and inflation. The pandemic and geopolitical tensions presented challenges to global economic stability, affecting India significantly. Supply disruptions and increased commodity prices led to elevated inflationary pressures in FY23 and FY24. However, prudent monetary policy responses and calibrated trade policy measures helped reduce core inflation to a four-year low in FY24. Food inflation was mitigated through administrative actions, including dynamic stock management and subsidized provision of essential food items. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) inflation projections indicate a benign and range-bound inflation outlook for India. India's retail inflation was 5.4% in FY24, the lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic. The inflation rate was within the target range of 2-6% in 2023. India's inflation management was relatively better compared to developed and emerging economies. The chapter highlights key policy recommendations, including strengthening price monitoring mechanisms, increasing domestic production of essential food items, and improving storage and processing facilities for vegetables. The RBI and IMF project India's consumer price inflation to align towards the inflation target in FY26, with projected inflation rates of 4.5% in FY25 and 4.1% in FY26. The World Bank expects a 3% decline in the commodity price index in 2024 and a 4% decrease in 2025. The chapter emphasizes the importance of focused efforts to increase the production of major oilseeds, pulses, and other essential food items to stabilize domestic prices and mitigate import dependence.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# PRICES AND INFLATION: UNDER CONTROL\n\n## PRICES AND INFLATION: UNDER CONTROL\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe pandemic and subsequent geo-political tensions presented considerable challenges to  the  global  economy in inflation management. The supply disruptions inflicted by the pandemic and increased commodity prices caused by heightened global conflicts markedly affected India. As a result, FY22 and FY23 witnessed price pressures in core consumer goods and services. Food prices were affected by adverse weather conditions in the last two years. The net impact of these developments was elevated inflationary pressures in FY23 and FY24. Prudent monetary policy response and calibrated trade policy measures by the Government, coupled with strong output growth, helped reduce core inflation to a four-year low in FY24. Appropriate administrative actions, including dynamic stock management, open market operations, subsidised provision of essential food items and trade policy measures, helped mitigate food inflation to a great extent. The expectation of a normal monsoon and moderating global prices of key imported items give credence to the benign and range-bound inflation projections for India made by the Reserve Bank of India and the International Monetary Fund. Beyond this, the medium to long-term inflation outlook will be shaped by the strengthening of price monitoring mechanisms and market intelligence as well as focussed efforts to increase the  domestic production of essential food items like pulses and edible oils for which India has a great degree of import dependence.",
