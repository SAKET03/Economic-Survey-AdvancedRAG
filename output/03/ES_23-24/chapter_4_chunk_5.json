  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nIndia's external sector remained strong amidst ongoing geopolitical headwinds and sticky inflation. Merchandise exports moderated due to lower demand from major trading partners, but services exports continued to perform well, cushioning the overall trade deficit from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24. Lower prices of imported commodities, including crude oil, also helped. The current account deficit (CAD) improved due to moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports. Software/IT services drove an increase in overall exports, while business services exports also rose, supported by India emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India's participation in global value chains (GVCs) increased, with the share of GVC-related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3% in 2022 from 35.1% in 2019. The country's rank in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023. India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows of USD 44.1 billion in FY24, supported by strong economic growth, a stable business environment, and increased investor confidence. The Indian Rupee remained in a manageable range of ₹82 to ₹83.5/USD in FY24 and was the least volatile currency among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies. The shock absorbers of India's external sector, including forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, and a market-determined exchange rate, are in place to cushion global headwinds. Going forward, the changing composition of India's export basket, enhancement in trade-related infrastructure, enhanced quality consciousness and product safety considerations in the private sector, and a stable policy environment are expected to drive India's rise as a global supplier of goods and services. India's trade openness indicator rose from 37.5 in FY05 to 45.9 in FY24, contributing significantly to economic growth. The share of trade (excluding petroleum products exports and crude oil imports) in GDP rose from 32.3% in FY05 to 40.8% in FY23. India's merchandise exports contracted in H2 of FY23 and H1 of FY24 due to geopolitical tensions but showed a trend reversal in H2 of FY24. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed to USD 238.3 billion in FY24 from USD 264.9 billion in the previous year. Non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery merchandise exports showed resilience with a sustained uptick, resulting in exports worth USD 320.2 billion in FY24, 1.5% higher than the previous year. India's defence production grew substantially from ₹74,054 crore in FY17 to ₹108,684 crore in FY23, boosting defence exports. India's toy exports registered a CAGR of 15.9% between FY13 and FY24, transforming India from a deficit to a surplus nation in the trade of toys. Footwear exports increased from USD 1.9 billion in FY21 to USD 2.5 billion in FY24. Smartphone exports ranked among India's top five export items, with a 42.2% increase in exports in FY24. India's domestic production and exports of smartphones have been increasing steadily, with significant changes achieved since the launch of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020.\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Favourable Current Account Balance\n\n## FAVOURABLE CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE\n\n4.53 The current account is a record of a country's international transactions with the rest of the world. Trade is the dominant component of India's current account. As discussed in para 4.13, the narrowing of the overall trade deficit and increasing remittances (refer to para 4.54 below) contributed to an improvement in the CAD in FY24. India's CAD narrowed to USD 23.2 billion (0.7 per cent of GDP) in FY24 from USD 67 billion (2 per cent of GDP) during the previous year. The improvement in CAD in FY24 is supported by the surplus in CAD recorded in  Q4  of  FY24  on  the  grounds  of  a  decline  in  merchandise  trade  deficit,  rising  net  services exports and increasing remittances. An analysis of India's CAD in relation to other nations reveals that India's CAD is relatively low (Chart IV. 21)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Table No. 196, 'India's Overall Balance of Payments-Quarterly-USD Dollars', External Sector, Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy, RBI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\n## Invisibles\n\n4.54 Net services receipts increased from USD 143.3 billion during FY23 to USD 162.8 billion in  FY24,  primarily  on  account  of  rising  exports  of  software,  travel  and  business  services. Similarly,  the  net  private  transfer  receipts,  mainly  representing  remittances  by  Indians employed overseas, was USD 106.6 billion in FY24, against their level of USD 101.8 billion during the previous year. Net services exports and remittances contributed to the surplus on the invisible account, which cushioned the merchandise trade deficit.\n\n4.55 Remittances are the second largest source of external financing after service exports, which  contributes  to  narrowing  the  CAD  and  has  always  been  a  stable  constituent  of  the BoP. According to the World Bank, India has the largest emigrant population and is the top remittance  recipient  country,  with  remittances  reaching  a  milestone  of  USD  120  billion  in 2023. 86  The increase in remittances was driven mainly by declining inflation and strong labour markets in the United States and Europe, the largest destination for India's skilled migrants, and other OECD destinations, as well as positive demand for skilled and less-skilled workers in the GCC countries (which, together, are the second largest destination for Indian migrants).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\n4.56 The remittance flows have also benefited from the agreement with the UAE to promote the use of Dirhams and Rupees for cross-border transactions. Remittances to India are forecasted to grow at 3.7 per cent to USD 124 billion in 2024 and at 4 per cent to reach USD 129 billion in 2025. India's share in South Asian remittances increased to 64.5 per cent in 2023 from 63 per cent in 2022. 87\n\n86    Migration  and  Development  Brief  40,  June  2024,  https://www.knomad.org/sites/default/files/publication-doc/migrationand-development-brief\\_40.pdf\n\n87  Ibid\n\n4.57 Remittances differ from FDI, which companies disinvest during financial uncertainties. In times of economic downturn, FDI is considered pro-cyclical and destabilising. Remittances are a stable source of finance that will remain in the economy and are directly used by recipients, contributing to the nation's growth. From a BoP perspective, remittances are permanent foreign currency inflows and help finance merchandise trade deficits, contributing to the narrowing of the CAD. For net importers such as India, higher remittances partially offset the goods trade deficit and stabilise the CAD.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Table No. 196, 'India's Overall Balance of Payments-Quarterly-USD Dollars', External Sector, Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy, RBI\n\nTable  No.  192,  'India's  Foreign  Trade-USD  Dollars',  External  Sector,  Handbook  of  Statistics  on  the  Indian Economy, RBI\n\nNote: Private transfers are assumed as remittances in BoP data released by RBI\n\n## Box IV.5: Factors influencing inward remittances\n\nThe  robust  recovery  of  job  markets  in  the  high-income  countries  of  the  Organisation  for Economic  Co-operation  and  Development  (OECD)  following  the  onset  of  the  COVID-19 pandemic has been the key driver of remittances, particularly as employment growth during the recovery was more rapid for immigrants than for the native-born. However, the remittance growth was 7.5 per cent in 2023 compared to a historic peak of 24.4 per cent in 2022.\n\nSome key factors influencing the extent of inward remittances to India are discussed below.\n\nRemittances and oil prices: India meets a large part of its crude oil demand from imports, and a rise in global oil prices is a negative shock to the economy as it leads to a widening of CAD, an increase in inflation, and a weaker rupee. As reported in the Monetary Policy Report (October 2018), 'it is estimated that for every USD 1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude, India's current account deficit could widen by USD 0.8 billion'. However, the rise in global oil prices generally positively impacts the remittances received by the country, as\n\nIndia's primary source of remittances is oil-exporting countries. An analysis of quarterly data on remittances and oil prices shows that there exists a positive correlation of 75.4 per cent between the two for India.\n\nChart IV.24 further corroborates this correlation, as periods of rise in oil prices are associated with higher remittances.\n\nThe  plausible  mechanism  is  as  follows:  an  increase  in  oil  prices  (positive  shocks)  can generate a sizable amount of oil revenues, leading to higher investments and growth in oilproducing countries. As a result, the demand for migrant workers increases, translating into higher remittance outflows. 88  On the other hand, persistently low oil prices (adverse shocks) can  hamper  economic  activities  in  oil-exporting  economies  by  decreasing  oil  revenues. Correspondingly,  the  demand  for  migrant  workers  decreases,  which  in  turn  can  reduce remittance outflows to migrant worker countries.\n\nChart IV.24: Association between gross remittances and crude oil price of Indian Basket\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource:  Table  No.  196,  'India's  Overall  Balance  of  Payments-Quarterly-USD  Dollars',  External  Sector, Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy, RBI\n\nCrude Oil FOB Price (Indian Basket), Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC)\n\nRemittances and exchange rate: A higher CAD results in an increase in the demand for foreign currency and an increase in the supply of domestic currency as firms and consumers buy more imports. This applies downward pressure to the exchange rate. On the other hand, remitters get better value in rupee terms when it depreciates in terms of foreign currencies, be it for UAE's Dirham, the US Dollar, the British Pound, or any other currency.\n\nFor every one USD a worker earns in distant lands, he returns an augmented amount after necessarily being converted according to the foreign land he works in. Hence, remittances exhibited a positive association with the exchange rate movement. An analysis of quarterly\n\n88    Ibid footnote 86\n\ndata on remittances and exchange rate shows that there exists a positive correlation of 91 per cent for India. Chart IV.25 further corroborates this correlation, as periods of exchange rate depreciation are associated with higher remittances.\n\nChart IV.25: Positive association of INR/USD and remittances\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource:  Table  No.  196,  'India's  Overall  Balance  of  Payments-Quarterly-USD  Dollars',  External  Sector, Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy, RBI\n\nTable No. 200, 'Exchange Rate of the Indian rupee vis-à-vis the SDR, US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Euro and Japanese Yen, External Sector, Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy, RBI\n\nOutlook: The outlook for remittance in India for 2024 is strong, with the expectation that remittance growth will moderate to 3.7 per cent, taking remittance levels to USD 124 billion in 2024. The diversification of India's migrant pool between a large share of highly skilled migrants employed mostly in high-income OECD markets, and the less-skilled migrants employed in the GCC markets is likely to lend stability to migrants' remittances in the event of external shocks. India's efforts to link its Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with source countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Singapore are expected to reduce costs and speed up remittances. 89",
