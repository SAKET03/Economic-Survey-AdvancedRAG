  "content": "Chapter 13 Summary:\nThe chapter discusses the issue of climate change and India's approach to addressing it. The author argues that the current global approach to climate change is flawed and that India needs to follow its own path to address the problem. The chapter highlights India's achievements in reducing emission intensity and increasing non-fossil fuel-based electric capacity. It also discusses the need for a sustainable lifestyle and the importance of individual actions in addressing climate change. The author introduces the concept of Mission LiFE, a unique initiative announced by the Prime Minister of India to bring individual responsibility to the forefront of the fight against climate change. The chapter also discusses the global pursuit of energy-guzzling technologies and the need for a collective policy reflective of individual pro-planet choices. The author emphasizes the importance of public policy and not the market in undertaking the 'right' decision. The chapter concludes by highlighting the need for a philosophical shift in understanding life and the importance of mindful consumption of resources.\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n## Mata Bhumi Putroham Prithivyah Earth is my mother and I am her son\n\n13.1.  Sustenance is at the core of Indian ethos. This principle underlies our relationship with Nature, with other people, with materiality, and within ourselves. Recognising and buttressing such ethos is important in today's world since India now comes face to face with it in a shiny new wrapper and a limited scope, ironically mandated from the part of the world that has otherwise relied on overconsumption as a pathway to growth.  As the clamour for sustainability resonates across the world, India finds itself surprised at the crossroads of having to address economically, what it has always believed and practised philosophically.\n\n13.2.  As the world's most populous country, currently globally the 5th largest economy, India is headed to become the 3rd largest by 2030.  Naturally, this means that our energy needs are expected to grow - about 1.5 times faster than the global average in the next 30 years 1 . Instead of appreciating the task at hand and the achievements already made by the country (Box 1), India is being called one of the largest polluters 2 , and hectored to do more even as a significant portion of the world does less.\n\n## Box XIII.1: India's achievements against targets for climate change\n\n- Successfully reduced the emission intensity vis-Ã -vis its GDP by 33% between 2005 and 2019, thus achieving the initial NDC target for 2030, 11 years ahead of scheduled time.\n- Also achieved 40% of electric installed capacity through non-fossil fuel sources, nine years ahead of the target for 2030. Between 2017 and 2023, India has added around 100 GW of installed electric capacity, of which around 80% is attributed to non-fossil fuelbased resources.\n- India's contribution to climate action is significant through its international efforts International Solar Alliance (ISA), Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI), creation of LeadIT, Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS), and Big Cat Alliance.\n\n13.3.  With  Climate  Change  as  the  new  North  Star  for  the  world,  it  is  now  well-established that  196  countries  must  meet  their  individual  commitments  under  'Nationally  Determined Contributions' towards reducing carbon emissions ' to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels ' 3 . Since globally all efforts hover on channelling precious resources towards attaining this artificial golden mean, with little clear idea of what happens if it doesn't, it naturally begets the question - 'Is the strategy adopted, both optimum and in everyone's interest?'\n\n13.4. This essay purports to examine this peculiar situation under three sections - assessment of global pathways to achieve climate change goals, inherent dissonance in the global strategy,\n\n1   IEA\n\n2    Why India is key to heading off climate catastrophe, Yale Climate Connections, May 2024 (https://tinyurl.com/ yfvvahws)\n\n3    The  Paris  Agreement,  adopted  by  196  parties  at  the  United  Nations  Climate  Change  Conference  (COP21), December 2015\n\nand  the  need  for  a  complementary  but  more  sustainable  strategy  centred  on  key  tenets  of existence (Mission LiFE).\n\n## CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE GLOBAL APPROACH\n\n13.5.  As  the  literature  goes,  greenhouse  gas  (GHG)  emissions,  particularly  carbon  dioxide (CO2),  primarily  contribute  to  adverse  climate  change.  The  Intergovernmental  Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) 4  paints a dire picture - emissions pose a serious threat since CO2, once released into the atmosphere, can hang for 300 to 1000 years 5 , causing global warming and environmental destruction such as the melting of polar ice caps.\n\n13.6. To  achieve  the  stated  objectives,  the  world  has  adopted  a  strategy  that  comprises  a set  of  pathways,  popularly  called  'climate  adaptation'  and  'climate  mitigation'.  Most  of  this includes shifting to energy sources other than fossil fuels, enhancing energy efficiency through innovative  and  environment-friendly  design,  adopting  regenerative  and  environmentally sensitive agricultural practices, as well as protecting and restoring the natural ecosystems (See Box XIII.2).\n\n## Box XIII.2: WEO-2023 proposes a global strategy for getting the world on track by  2030\n\nThe Five Key Pillars to this proposal include:\n\n- Tripling global Renewable Energy Capacity.\n- Doubling the rate of Energy Efficiency improvements.\n- Slashing methane emissions from fossil fuel operations by 75 per cent.\n- Innovative,  large-scale  financing  mechanisms  to  triple  clean  energy  investments  in emerging and developing economies.\n- Measures to ensure an orderly decline in the use of fossil fuels, including an end to new approvals of unabated coal-fired power plants.",
