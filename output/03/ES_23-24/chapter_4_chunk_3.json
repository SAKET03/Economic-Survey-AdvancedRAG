Merchandise exports moderated due to lower demand from major trading partners, but services exports continued to perform well, cushioning the overall trade deficit from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24. Lower prices of imported commodities, including crude oil, also helped. The current account deficit (CAD) improved due to moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports. Software/IT services drove an increase in overall exports, while business services exports also rose, supported by India emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India's participation in global value chains (GVCs) increased, with the share of GVC-related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3% in 2022 from 35.1% in 2019. The country's rank in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023. India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows of USD 44.1 billion in FY24, supported by strong economic growth, a stable business environment, and increased investor confidence. The Indian Rupee remained in a manageable range of ₹82 to ₹83.5/USD in FY24 and was the least volatile currency among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies. The shock absorbers of India's external sector, including forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, and a market-determined exchange rate, are in place to cushion global headwinds. Going forward, the changing composition of India's export basket, enhancement in trade-related infrastructure, enhanced quality consciousness and product safety considerations in the private sector, and a stable policy environment are expected to drive India's rise as a global supplier of goods and services. India's trade openness indicator rose from 37.5 in FY05 to 45.9 in FY24, contributing significantly to economic growth. The share of trade (excluding petroleum products exports and crude oil imports) in GDP rose from 32.3% in FY05 to 40.8% in FY23. India's merchandise exports contracted in H2 of FY23 and H1 of FY24 due to geopolitical tensions but showed a trend reversal in H2 of FY24. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed to USD 238.3 billion in FY24 from USD 264.9 billion in the previous year. Non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery merchandise exports showed resilience with a sustained uptick, resulting in exports worth USD 320.2 billion in FY24, 1.5% higher than the previous year. India's defence production grew substantially from ₹74,054 crore in FY17 to ₹108,684 crore in FY23, boosting defence exports. India's toy exports registered a CAGR of 15.9% between FY13 and FY24, transforming India from a deficit to a surplus nation in the trade of toys. Footwear exports increased from USD 1.9 billion in FY21 to USD 2.5 billion in FY24. Smartphone exports ranked among India's top five export items, with a 42.2% increase in exports in FY24. India's domestic production and exports of smartphones have been increasing steadily, with significant changes achieved since the launch of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020.\n\nSubchapter 3 Content:\n# Changing Global Trade Dynamics\n\n## CHANGING GLOBAL TRADE DYNAMICS\n\n- 4.4 Trade is a key pillar of an economy, spurring investment, job creation, economic growth, and raising living standards. Global trade patterns are reconfiguring. In 2023, Mexico became the largest goods trade partner of the US, surpassing China and Canada, with a total trade of USD 798 billion. 4  Vietnam's trade with China and the US has recently seen an increase. US imports from Vietnam more than doubled from USD 46 billion in 2017 to USD 114 billion in 2023. During the same time, Vietnam's imports from China rose from USD 58 billion to USD 111 billion. 5  In another instance, European economies are shifting their energy imports from Russia to Norway and the US. EU's pipeline gas imports from Russia declined from 150.2 billion cubic meters in 2021 to 42.9 billion cubic meters in 2023. During the same time, its pipeline gas  imports  from  the  US  rose  from  18.9  billion  cubic  meters  to  56.2  billion  cubic  meters. 6 These shifts reflect the emergence of new practices in international trade such as 'decoupling', 'derisking',  'reshoring',  'nearshoring',  and  'friend  sharing'  and  the  growing  narrative  of  deglobalisation. 7\n- 4.5 However, there is an argument that while the growth of trade as a percentage of GDP has  stalled  since  the  global  financial  crisis,  the  slowdown  of  global  trade  seems  a  natural development following its earlier fast growth (Chart IV.2). 8  The de-globalisation trends are highly heterogeneous across countries. While the US and China are gradually decreasing their reliance  on  global  markets,  this  does  not  seem  true  for  the  rest  of  the  world. 9 Research  by the Bank for International Settlement (BIS) shows that despite its policies, the US remains reliant on Chinese inputs. In fact, the rise in trade through Mexico and Vietnam is a result of Chinese firms re-routing their supply through these countries (or by locating themselves in these countries). Further, China's overwhelming dominance in the supply of processed critical minerals and materials for energy transition renders a true decoupling between the two nations neither easy nor likely.\n- 4.6 As can be seen in Chart IV.1, global trade volume contracted by 1.2 per cent in 2023 after recording a 3 per cent expansion in 2022 following the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 10 The value of world merchandise trade fell by 5 per cent in 2023, indicating the effect of lower prices. This decline was offset mainly by a substantial increase in trade in commercial services, which rose by 9 per cent to USD 7.5 billion in 2023. Commercial services trade was lifted by\n\n4  India-Mexico Trade and Commercial Relations, para 3,  https://tinyurl.com/5h4v96jp,\n\n5   Source: Vietnam Customs Office and US Census Bureau, https://www.customs.gov.vn/index.jsp?pageId=4964, https://www. census.gov/en.html\n\n6   Source: European Commission based on ENTSO-G and Refinitiv, https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/infographics/eu-gassupply/#0\n\n7   As per the World Economic Forum, friend-shoring refers to rerouting supply chains to countries perceived as politically and economically safe or low-risk to avoid disruption to the flow of business. Nearshoring refers to a company relocating business operations to a nearby country, often with a shared border. Reshoring is when a business transfers operations back to its home country.\n\n8   Goldberg, P. K., &amp; Reed, T. (2023). Is the Global Economy Deglobalizing? And if so, why? And what is next?

Global exports of digitally delivered services rose by 9 per cent to USD 4.3 trillion in 2023, accounting for 13.8 per cent of the world exports of goods and services.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4.7 The adverse trade environment in 2023 is expected to ease somewhat this year and next, boosting goods trade in 2024 and 2025. 11  World merchandise trade volume is expected to grow at 2.6 per cent and 3.3 per cent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, as demand for traded goods rebounds. The evidence of a rebound in global trade in 2025 is visible in the latest report released by UNCTAD. 12   As per the report, global trade trends turned positive in the first quarter of 2024, with the value of trade in goods increasing by around 1 per cent quarter-over-quarter and services by about 1.5 per cent. The growth was primarily driven by increased exports from China (9 per cent), India (7 per cent) and the USA (3 per cent). However, geopolitical tensions and policy uncertainty could limit the scope of any trade rebound. While export growth is expected to improve in many economies as external demand for goods picks up, food and energy prices could again spike due to geopolitical events and climate disturbances. Further, restrictive trade practices increasingly adopted by many countries are leading to higher prices because supply chains have become increasingly complex. 13\n\n4.8 The resilience of global trade is being tested by disruptions on two of the world's leading shipping routes, viz the Panama Canal and the Suez Canal. The Panama Canal handles 6 per cent of global trade and over 70 per cent of traffic destined for or originating from the US. It is presently operating at partial capacity due to freshwater shortages, with restrictions likely to  remain in place for some time. Meanwhile, the Suez Canal handles about 12 per cent of global trade and about one-third of container shipping between Asia and Europe. 14  The traffic\n\n11 Ibid, Note 10\n\n12 UNCTAD report, 'Global trade growth resumes in first quarter of 2024', https://tinyurl.com/3hefazed\n\n13   World Bank blog dated 22 February 2024, 'Global trade has nearly flatlined.

Although  global  shipping  costs  returned to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of last year, container shipping rates have risen again. Extended detours around the Cape of Good Hope have led to a significant surge in ocean freight rates, reaching up to USD 10,000 per 40-foot container. Moreover, the Suez Canal Authority has declared a 5-15 per cent hike in transit fees for ships passing through the Panama Canal. 15\n\n- 4.9 Amidst these prevailing geopolitical dynamics, India is expected to benefit from its strong trade relations across countries, as the analysis in the subsequent sections shows. India has broad and diversified trade relationships with Asia, Europe, and the US. The following section discusses India's trade performance.",
