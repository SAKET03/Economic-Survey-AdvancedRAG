See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Indian economy has grown significantly over the last decade, with a 12-fold increase in size from less than $300 billion in 1993 to an estimated $3.6 trillion in 2024. Despite the Indian rupee depreciating by around 3% annually between 1993 and 2024, the economy has achieved this growth without a significant rise in overall indebtedness. India's per capita current dollar GDP has increased from $301.5 in 1993 to $2,484.8 in 2023, indicating a substantial improvement in the standard of living.\\n\\nThe government aims to make India a developed nation by 2047, and the economy can grow at a rate of 7% plus on a sustained basis if structural reforms are built upon. A six-pronged growth strategy is proposed to achieve this goal, focusing on generating productive employment, addressing the skill gap challenge, tapping the full potential of the agriculture sector, easing compliance requirements and financing bottlenecks for MSMEs, managing India's green transition, and deepening the corporate bond market.\\n\\nThe global backdrop is complex, with rising geopolitical conflicts, a clash of priorities between globalist elites and nationalists, and a crisis posed by climate change and global warming. India faces several challenges, including sustaining economic growth, maintaining a constant vigil on its borders, and dealing with cybersecurity threats. The economy needs to generate domestic resources for investment and growth priorities, and geopolitics imposes a ceiling on external deficit and external financing.\\n\\nThe medium-term growth outlook for the Indian economy is premised on key tenets, including increasing geoeconomic fragmentation, a global trust deficit, and the integration of climate change strategies into national development policy and planning. The chapter identifies key areas of policy focus, including generating productive employment, addressing the skill gap challenge, and managing India's green transition.\\n\\nIndia's workforce is estimated to be nearly 56.5 crore, with 45% employed in agriculture, 11.4% in manufacturing, 28.9% in services, and 13% in construction. The services sector remains a major job creator, but the construction sector has been rising in prominence. The manufacturing sector employment creation has been subdued in the past decade but appears to have rebounded since 2021-22.\\n\\nThe skill gap challenge is significant, with 65% of India's population under 35, and many lacking the skills needed by a modern economy. Only 51.25% of youth are deemed employable, and there is a need to create avenues for the labor force leaving agriculture. The agriculture sector continues to face structural issues, including sustaining agriculture growth without letting food price inflation rise beyond acceptable limits.\\n\\nMSMEs have played a key role in defining the economic trajectory of major economies, but the sector continues to face extensive regulation and compliance requirements and significant bottlenecks with access to affordable and timely funding. India has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 33-35% from 2005 levels by 2030 and enhancing forest cover to absorb 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.\\n\\nThe government has launched several schemes aimed at providing affordable credit to MSMEs, including the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises. The Lok Sabha Standing Committee on Finance estimated that the credit gap in the MSME sector is around Rs 20-25 lakh crore.\\n\\nIndia's economic growth story over the last decade has been one of resilience, weathering multiple global crises through deft government handling. The structural reforms undertaken by the government have put the economy firmly on a growth path, and India is set to become the third-largest economy in the world. The IMF has raised India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.8% from 6.5% on the back of strong domestic demand and a rising working-age population.\\n\\nThe government has been following a policy of continuity and change as India progresses towards the collective goal of Viksit Bharat @2047. The prime minister has emphasized the need for everyone's effort to achieve this goal, and the growth strategy presented in the chapter seeks to build on policy initiatives undertaken since 2014. The economy can grow at or above 7% on a sustained basis if structural reforms are built upon, and the government aims to sustain growth for nearly a generation up to 2047 or more.The Indian economy has made significant strides in delivering crucial infrastructure and implementing direct benefit schemes aimed at enhancing citizens' well-being. The civil service has been at the heart of these transformative efforts, designing policies and ensuring initiatives reach all citizens. However, sustaining and accelerating India's progress requires the state machinery to reimagine, reinvent, reinvigorate, and re-equip itself.\\n\\nThe government has made a significant beginning in lateral entry into senior ranks of Central Ministries through a transparent process. This needs to be substantially expanded to plug the gap in diverse skills and mindsets. Foundational and mid-career training for civil servants in all specialties has to be re-imagined for recharging and rebooting skills, aptitude, and attitudes.\\n\\nMission Karmayogi aims to enhance state capacity using the 'Workforce-Work-Workplace' framework to address each level of the civil service and linkages between them. It provides a multi-pronged solution encompassing building the capacity of the workforce, improving the quality of work, and enhancing the workplace.\\n\\nThe program endeavors to enhance state capacity by connecting workplace roles and workers' competencies. Competencies are the attitudes, skills, and knowledge essential for a civil servant to perform their role successfully. The Karmayogi Competency Model is a public human resource management framework developed by the Capacity Building Commission of India.\\n\\nThe model is built on four elements: self-awareness, collaboration and inclusion, transparency and compliance, and citizen-centricity. Competencies then become a key tool for enhancing the performance of civil servants. Capacity-building programs can be designed to build specific competencies that a civil servant needs to perform their role well.\\n\\nMission Karmayogi is also introducing a role-based human resource management system to match civil servants with roles based on competencies. Decision-making around postings, transfers, and promotions can then be guided by civil servants' demonstrated competencies and experience.\\n\\nThe Indian economy grew at 7% in 2023-24, with a growth rate of 7.3% in the second half of the year. The manufacturing sector grew at 8.1% in 2023-24, driven by a growth of 9.1% in the second half of the year. The services sector grew at 7.1% in 2023-24, with a growth rate of 7.4% in the second half of the year.\\n\\nThe inflation rate averaged around 5% in 2023-24, with a peak of 5.4% in March 2024. The current account deficit narrowed to 1.2% of GDP in 2023-24 from 2.4% in 2022-23. The fiscal deficit declined to 5.2% of GDP in 2023-24 from 6.4% in 2022-23.\\n\\nThe Indian government announced several policy measures to support economic growth, including a cut in the corporate tax rate and a hike in the import duty on certain electronics components. The government also announced a plan to privatize several state-owned enterprises, including banks and insurance companies.\\n\\nThe Indian economy is expected to grow at 7.2% in 2024-25, driven by a growth rate of 7.5% in the manufacturing sector and 7.2% in the services sector. The inflation rate is expected to average around 4.5% in 2024-25.\\n\\nThe government aims to achieve a growth rate of 8-9% in the next few years, driven by investments in infrastructure and a growth in the manufacturing sector. The government also aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26.\\n\\nThe Indian economy has the potential to grow at 7-8% in the long term, driven by a growth in the manufacturing sector and a rise in private sector investment. The government needs to implement policy measures to support economic growth, including investments in infrastructure and a growth in the manufacturing sector.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Outlook in the Medium Term\n\n## OUTLOOK IN THE MEDIUM TERM\n\n5.32.  The Indian growth story over the last decade has been one of resilience. The country has weathered the onslaught of multiple global crises because the government dealt with them deftly by forging a recovery strategy that was uniquely designed to address the concerns of citizens while ensuring that the growth momentum continued to be sustained through a wide range of structural reforms. India's strength has always been its institutions, and, many a time, the institutional strength has enabled the country to wade through multiple challenges.\n\n5.33.  The structural reforms undertaken by the Government of India over the course of the last decade have put the economy firmly on a growth path, thanks to which India is soon set to become the third largest economy in the world, following the US and China. In its April 2024 World Economic Outlook, the IMF has raised India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.8 per cent from 6.5 per cent on the back of strong domestic demand and a rising working-age population, making India the fastest-growing G20 economy. It is in line with our expectations for economic growth, as mentioned in Chapter 1. India has graduated from being a low-income country to a low-middle-income country. As it journeys further towards middle and uppermiddle-income status, aspirations of the people keep rising. Satisfaction with past progress fades away from memory quickly, and newer expectations take their place. The measurement of  achievements in the present against rising aspirations leaves society appear restless and discontented. But, this is creative and not destructive. The latent energy of such aspirations needs to be harnessed even as they have to be met. This has to be carried out in a country of  India's  size  and  within  a  democratic  framework.  There  are  no  historical  precedents  and templates to follow for the complexity it entails. What has brought the economy to its present state from where it was three decades ago may not take us to the next destination. Awareness of the unique nature of India's circumstances and its goals is necessary to prepare ourselves to participate in and contribute to its socio-economic progress. Our knowledge and attitudes have to continually evolve to keep up with the requirements that the project, 'Viksit Bharat @2047' entails. Open minds are a good place to start.\n\n5.34.Given the above, the present chapter presents a six-pronged growth strategy premised on the understanding that the structural reforms of the last decade, focused on the supply side of\n\nthe economy, have to give way to next-gen reforms that are bottom-up in nature to yield strong, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Primary amongst these strategies is to ensure that capital formation in the private sector grows organically and steadily, delivering endogenous growth in jobs and a fair share of income for workers. Second, financing green transition for India is an area where public-private partnerships will be critical. There need to be innovative financing instruments that can help mobilise private capital towards India's transition efforts. Third, as far as MSMEs are concerned while bridging the credit gap remains a crucial element, the focus also needs to be on deregulation, enhancing physical and digital connectivity, and putting in place an export strategy that enables MSMEs to broaden their market exposure and scale up. Fourth, the potential of agriculture to be an engine of growth, development, and equity has to be exploited through intelligent farmer-friendly policies that are environmentally and climatically sustainable. Fifth, India's education policies and skill policies should adopt a laserlike focus on learning and skilling outcomes and need to be aligned with each other, as well. We can draw lessons from global experiences on how this could be achieved, such as the EU Cohesion Policy 33 . Lastly, enhancing state capacity and capability is critical to ensure that the growth strategy suggested in this chapter achieves fruition. Sustaining and accelerating India's progress in the face of evolving challenges requires dedicated investment in state machinery to reinvent and reinvigorate itself.\n\n5.35.  In Chapter 2 of 'The Indian Economy: A Review', published in January 2024, we wrote that there was considerable scope for the economy to grow at or above 7 per cent on a sustained basis if we could build on the structural reforms undertaken since 2014. The strengthening of the banking system, the creation of an Insolvency and bankruptcy framework, the institution of a nationwide Goods and Services Tax, and the expansion of the country's physical and digital infrastructure are but a few of them. The strategies presented in this Chapter seek to build on these policy initiatives.\n\n5.36.  The new government at the helm of affairs signifies continuity as well as change as India progresses towards the collective goal of ViksitBharat@2047. As envisioned by Prime Minister Modi, ' We need to walk the roadmap of progress, and it won't be solely determined by the government; the nation will shape it. Every citizen will have to give his input and actively participate in it. 'Sabka Prayas', meaning everyone's effort, is a mantra that turns the biggest resolutions into reality. Whether it's the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, Digital India campaign, dealing with COVID-19, or the idea of Vocal for Local, we have all witnessed the power of 'Sabka Prayas'. It is through 'Sabka Prayas' that a 'Viksit Bharat' will materialise 34 .'\n\n33   Education,  training  and  lifelong  learning  remain  a  priority  in  the  2021-2027  period  in  EU  cohesion  policy. Overall, EUR 33.6 billion of EU planned allocations have been allocated to measures directly targeting education, training and skills development. The combination and coordination of measures supported by these funds will allow  Member  States  and  regions  to  strengthen  their  efforts  towards  more  inclusive  and  quality  education and training systems in an integrated manner, as well as support reforms in these areas, https://tinyurl.com/ wsuwjsdj)\n\n34 PIB press release of Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry dated 11th Dec, 2023 (https://tinyurl.com/yc2r4ate)",
