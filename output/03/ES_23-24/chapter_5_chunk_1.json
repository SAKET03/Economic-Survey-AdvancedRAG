See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Indian economy has grown significantly over the last decade, with a 12-fold increase in size from less than $300 billion in 1993 to an estimated $3.6 trillion in 2024. Despite the Indian rupee depreciating by around 3% annually between 1993 and 2024, the economy has achieved this growth without a significant rise in overall indebtedness. India's per capita current dollar GDP has increased from $301.5 in 1993 to $2,484.8 in 2023, indicating a substantial improvement in the standard of living.\\n\\nThe government aims to make India a developed nation by 2047, and the economy can grow at a rate of 7% plus on a sustained basis if structural reforms are built upon. A six-pronged growth strategy is proposed to achieve this goal, focusing on generating productive employment, addressing the skill gap challenge, tapping the full potential of the agriculture sector, easing compliance requirements and financing bottlenecks for MSMEs, managing India's green transition, and deepening the corporate bond market.\\n\\nThe global backdrop is complex, with rising geopolitical conflicts, a clash of priorities between globalist elites and nationalists, and a crisis posed by climate change and global warming. India faces several challenges, including sustaining economic growth, maintaining a constant vigil on its borders, and dealing with cybersecurity threats. The economy needs to generate domestic resources for investment and growth priorities, and geopolitics imposes a ceiling on external deficit and external financing.\\n\\nThe medium-term growth outlook for the Indian economy is premised on key tenets, including increasing geoeconomic fragmentation, a global trust deficit, and the integration of climate change strategies into national development policy and planning. The chapter identifies key areas of policy focus, including generating productive employment, addressing the skill gap challenge, and managing India's green transition.\\n\\nIndia's workforce is estimated to be nearly 56.5 crore, with 45% employed in agriculture, 11.4% in manufacturing, 28.9% in services, and 13% in construction. The services sector remains a major job creator, but the construction sector has been rising in prominence. The manufacturing sector employment creation has been subdued in the past decade but appears to have rebounded since 2021-22.\\n\\nThe skill gap challenge is significant, with 65% of India's population under 35, and many lacking the skills needed by a modern economy. Only 51.25% of youth are deemed employable, and there is a need to create avenues for the labor force leaving agriculture. The agriculture sector continues to face structural issues, including sustaining agriculture growth without letting food price inflation rise beyond acceptable limits.\\n\\nMSMEs have played a key role in defining the economic trajectory of major economies, but the sector continues to face extensive regulation and compliance requirements and significant bottlenecks with access to affordable and timely funding. India has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 33-35% from 2005 levels by 2030 and enhancing forest cover to absorb 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide.\\n\\nThe government has launched several schemes aimed at providing affordable credit to MSMEs, including the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana and the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises. The Lok Sabha Standing Committee on Finance estimated that the credit gap in the MSME sector is around Rs 20-25 lakh crore.\\n\\nIndia's economic growth story over the last decade has been one of resilience, weathering multiple global crises through deft government handling. The structural reforms undertaken by the government have put the economy firmly on a growth path, and India is set to become the third-largest economy in the world. The IMF has raised India's growth forecast for 2024-25 to 6.8% from 6.5% on the back of strong domestic demand and a rising working-age population.\\n\\nThe government has been following a policy of continuity and change as India progresses towards the collective goal of Viksit Bharat @2047. The prime minister has emphasized the need for everyone's effort to achieve this goal, and the growth strategy presented in the chapter seeks to build on policy initiatives undertaken since 2014. The economy can grow at or above 7% on a sustained basis if structural reforms are built upon, and the government aims to sustain growth for nearly a generation up to 2047 or more.The Indian economy has made significant strides in delivering crucial infrastructure and implementing direct benefit schemes aimed at enhancing citizens' well-being. The civil service has been at the heart of these transformative efforts, designing policies and ensuring initiatives reach all citizens. However, sustaining and accelerating India's progress requires the state machinery to reimagine, reinvent, reinvigorate, and re-equip itself.\\n\\nThe government has made a significant beginning in lateral entry into senior ranks of Central Ministries through a transparent process. This needs to be substantially expanded to plug the gap in diverse skills and mindsets. Foundational and mid-career training for civil servants in all specialties has to be re-imagined for recharging and rebooting skills, aptitude, and attitudes.\\n\\nMission Karmayogi aims to enhance state capacity using the 'Workforce-Work-Workplace' framework to address each level of the civil service and linkages between them. It provides a multi-pronged solution encompassing building the capacity of the workforce, improving the quality of work, and enhancing the workplace.\\n\\nThe program endeavors to enhance state capacity by connecting workplace roles and workers' competencies. Competencies are the attitudes, skills, and knowledge essential for a civil servant to perform their role successfully. The Karmayogi Competency Model is a public human resource management framework developed by the Capacity Building Commission of India.\\n\\nThe model is built on four elements: self-awareness, collaboration and inclusion, transparency and compliance, and citizen-centricity. Competencies then become a key tool for enhancing the performance of civil servants. Capacity-building programs can be designed to build specific competencies that a civil servant needs to perform their role well.\\n\\nMission Karmayogi is also introducing a role-based human resource management system to match civil servants with roles based on competencies. Decision-making around postings, transfers, and promotions can then be guided by civil servants' demonstrated competencies and experience.\\n\\nThe Indian economy grew at 7% in 2023-24, with a growth rate of 7.3% in the second half of the year. The manufacturing sector grew at 8.1% in 2023-24, driven by a growth of 9.1% in the second half of the year. The services sector grew at 7.1% in 2023-24, with a growth rate of 7.4% in the second half of the year.\\n\\nThe inflation rate averaged around 5% in 2023-24, with a peak of 5.4% in March 2024. The current account deficit narrowed to 1.2% of GDP in 2023-24 from 2.4% in 2022-23. The fiscal deficit declined to 5.2% of GDP in 2023-24 from 6.4% in 2022-23.\\n\\nThe Indian government announced several policy measures to support economic growth, including a cut in the corporate tax rate and a hike in the import duty on certain electronics components. The government also announced a plan to privatize several state-owned enterprises, including banks and insurance companies.\\n\\nThe Indian economy is expected to grow at 7.2% in 2024-25, driven by a growth rate of 7.5% in the manufacturing sector and 7.2% in the services sector. The inflation rate is expected to average around 4.5% in 2024-25.\\n\\nThe government aims to achieve a growth rate of 8-9% in the next few years, driven by investments in infrastructure and a growth in the manufacturing sector. The government also aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26.\\n\\nThe Indian economy has the potential to grow at 7-8% in the long term, driven by a growth in the manufacturing sector and a rise in private sector investment. The government needs to implement policy measures to support economic growth, including investments in infrastructure and a growth in the manufacturing sector.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# MEDIUM TERM OUTLOOK: A GROWTH VISION FOR NEW INDIA\n\n## MEDIUM TERM OUTLOOK: A GROWTH VISION FOR NEW INDIA\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe direct benefit of a 'Viksit Bharat' is the dignity of our citizens and the improvement in their quality of life.'\n\n- Extracted from Hon'ble Prime Minister's reply to the Motion of Thanks on the President's Address in the Lok Sabha on July 2, 2024\n\nThe Indian growth story over the last decade has been one of resilience. The structural reforms  undertaken  by  the  Government  of  India  since  2014  have  put  the  economy firmly on a growth path, and India is soon set to become the third-largest economy in the world. In the medium term, the Indian economy can grow at a rate of 7 per cent plus on a sustained basis if we can build on the structural reforms undertaken over the last decade. Against this backdrop, the chapter identifies the areas of key policy focus as well as presents a six-pronged growth strategy to achieve this goal. The strategy elucidated in the chapter is premised on the understanding that the structural reforms of the last decade, focused on the supply side of the economy, have to give way to nextgen reforms that are bottom-up in nature to yield strong, sustainable, balanced, and inclusive growth.",
