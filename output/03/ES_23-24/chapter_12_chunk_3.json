The capital expenditure of the government has seen an almost three-fold increase in FY24 relative to FY20 levels, with major beneficiaries being key foundational assets like roads and railways.\\n\\nThe government has also implemented institutional and procedural reforms to facilitate project execution and timely issue resolutions, including initiatives to enhance private sector participation through PPPs, and measures like National Infrastructure Pipeline and Project Monitoring Group. The chapter highlights that with increased public investment over the last five years, India has witnessed significant expansion in physical and digital connectivity and social infrastructure.\\n\\nThe creation of resilient, world-class infrastructure is a key plank of India's policy strategy to become Viksit Bharat @2047. The chapter examines recent developments in India's infrastructure space, with a special focus on progress achieved in FY24. The chapter is divided into six sections, investigating infrastructure financing, sectoral developments, challenges, and outlook.\\n\\nInfrastructure financing in India still relies heavily on capital expenditure by the Union and State Governments. Despite financial innovations, public expenditure continues to play a central role in funding large-scale infrastructure projects. The capital expenditure of the Union Government increased by 2.2 times from FY21 to FY24, while that of State governments increased by 2.1 times during the same period.\\n\\nThe share of gross budgetary support to two key connectivity segments, Railways and National Highway Authority of India, in the total capital expenditure of the Union Government increased from 36.4% in FY21 to 42.9% in FY24. The aggregate investible resources of CPSEs, consisting of GBS and resources raised by CPSEs, have been optimized to reduce borrowing costs.\\n\\nThe net flow of funds to infrastructure sectors through bank credit between March 2023 to March 2024 was around ₹79,000 crore. The credit growth to infrastructure sectors in FY24 recovered to 6.5%, as against the growth of 2.3% in FY23. The gross inflow of external commercial borrowings to infrastructure sectors picked up to USD 9.05 billion in FY24.\\n\\nThe resource mobilization by infrastructure sectors through debt and equity issuances in the capital market was just over ₹1,00,000 crore during FY24. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have raised ₹18,840 crore from 2019 to 2024, while Infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) raised a total of ₹1,11,294 crore in the last five years.\\n\\nThe National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) was announced in August 2021, with an aggregate monetization potential of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years. During the first two years, transactions aggregating to about ₹2.3 lakh crore in accruals or private investments were completed under the core asset monetization program.\\n\\nThe development of expressways and corridors, along with transformative initiatives, has been the highlight of the recent road sector growth journey. The Bharatmala Pariyojana has significantly expanded the national highway network, increasing the length of high-speed corridors by 12 times and 4-lane roads by 2.6 times between 2014 and 2024.\\n\\nThe average pace of NH construction increased by ~3 times from 11.7 km per day in FY14 to ~34 km per day by FY24. The Indian Railways' capital expenditure increased by 77% over the past 5 years, with significant investments in new lines, gauge conversion, and doubling.\\n\\nThe power transmission system in India is connected into one grid running on one frequency, with an inter-regional capability of transferring 1,18,740 megawatts. The peak electricity demand increased by 13% to 243 GW in FY24. The renewable energy sector received approximately USD 17.88 billion as FDI from April 2000 until March 2024.\\n\\nThe Jal Jeevan Mission was launched in August 2019 to provide a tap water connection to every rural household by 2024 with a total outlay of ₹3.6 lakh crore. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) was launched in 2015 to provide pucca houses with basic amenities to all eligible beneficiaries in urban areas.\\n\\nThe Smart Cities Mission was launched in June 2015 to promote cities that provide core infrastructure, clean and sustainable environment, and give a decent quality of life to their citizens. The Swachh Bharat Mission Urban focuses on ensuring every citizen, including the poor household of urban India, has access to sanitation facilities.\\n\\nThe tourism sector has seen significant growth, with 29 new sites identified for development under the PRASHAD scheme. The Indian space sector has seen remarkable progress, with 55 active space assets, including 18 communication satellites and 20 Earth Observation satellites.\\n\\nThe digital infrastructure in India has been improving, with the usage and underlying technologies of telecommunications undergoing massive changes. The Government has introduced guidelines for the Spectrum Regulatory Sandbox to foster innovation and enhance ease of doing business in the telecommunications sector.\\n\\nThe electronics and information technology sector has seen significant growth, with the Government envisioning the India AI program as a mission-centric approach for leveraging transformative technologies. The India AI program aims to democratize access to AI innovation pillars and ensure global competitiveness of India's AI ecosystem.\\n\\nThe chapter highlights several challenges, including land-related issues, skill demands, need to improve private participation, climate and environmental sustainability, and lack of aggregation of financial flows into infrastructure. The government has launched several initiatives to address these challenges, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline, Project Monitoring Group, and PM GatiShakti National Master Plan.\\n\\nThe National Logistics Policy was launched in September 2022 to complement PMGS-NMP, aiming to drive business competitiveness through an integrated, efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective logistics network. The policy aims to reduce the cost of logistics, improve the Logistics Performance Index ranking, and create a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem.\\n\\nOverall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in India's infrastructure space, highlighting the progress achieved in FY24, and the challenges and opportunities ahead.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 3 Content:\n# Infrastructure financing: the public expenditure push\n\n## INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCING: THE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PUSH\n\n12.3.  This  section  brings  out  two  important  facts  about  infrastructure  financing  in  India. Firstly,  despite  many  financial  innovations  in  infrastructure  financing  in  the  recent  years, capital expenditure by the Union and State Governments still have the central role in funding of large-scale infrastructure projects. Secondly, with the emergence of a number of new funding instruments and strategies, the infrastructure financing space has become complex, and, given the  differential  definitions  and  patterns  followed  in  maintenance  of  statistics  by  different agencies, it is difficult to aggregate the total flow of funds for the creation of infrastructure in any given year.\n\n12.4. Even though budgetary capital expenditure cannot be equated to infrastructure spending 4 , the infrastructure thrust of the Government has led to an unprecedented increase in capital expenditure. Chart XII.1 shows that the capital expenditure of the Union Government increased by 2.2 times from FY21 to FY24 (PA) while that of the State governments increased by 2.1 times during the same period.\n\n12.5.  The capital expenditure of the Union Government broadly includes two componentsthe  spending  by  its  line  departments  and  the  gross  budgetary  support  (GBS)  given  to  the Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs). The share of gross budgetary support to two key connectivity  segments,  i.e.,  Railways  and  National  Highway  Authority  of  India,  in  the  total capital expenditure of the Union Government increased from 36.4 per cent in FY21 to 42.9 per cent in FY24 (RE). These two components of capital expenditure increased by 2.6 times from FY21 to FY24 (RE) in their absolute values.\n\n12.6. The aggregate investible resources of the CPSEs consists of the GBS and the resources raised by CPSEs themselves. In order to optimise the combined borrowing cost of the Union Government and the CPSEs, the higher-cost borrowings of the two major infra-CPSEs-NHAI and Indian Railway Finance Corporation (IRFC) - were progressively reduced from FY21 to FY24. This is, to a large extent, reflected in the reduction in the own resources of the CPSEs in\n\n4    Capital expenditure of the Government includes its spending to create any capital asset, which may not be created under a sector classified as infrastructure under the harmonious definition of infrastructure.\n\nChart XII.1. However, this reduction was more than offset by the expansionary GBS, thereby allowing investment in roads and railways to increase sizeably between FY21 and FY24.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.7.  The support of the Union Government for capital expenditure of the State Governments and  instititions  increased  by  31.6  per  cent  during  FY21  and  FY24.  Further  analysis  of  the capital expenditure of the State Governments is not possible as the data on the GBS by the State Government to the State Public Sector Enterprises (SPSEs) and the resources mobilised by SPSEs themselves are not available in a consolidated form.\n\n12.8. Charts XII.3 through XII.9 on important non-government sources of funding reiterates the fact that the recent infrastructure thrust in India, especially the surge in connectivity projects, has  banked  predominantly  on  public  expenditure.  The  net  flow  of  funds  to  infrastructure sectors through bank credit between March 2023 to March 2024 was only around ₹79,000 crore, much less than the GBS by the Union Government for either railways or roads. Charts XII.3 to XII.5 also show that the net flow of bank credit between March 2020 and March 2024 was concentrated in only a few sectors roads, airports and power. However, the credit growth to infrastructure sectors in FY24 recovered to 6.5 per cent, as against the growth of 2.3 per cent, in FY23.\n\n12.9. The gross inflow of external commercial borrowings to infrastructure sectors also picked up to USD 9.05 billion in FY24, as against an average of USD 5.91 billion during FY20 to FY23.\n\nThe  resource  mobilisation  by  infrastructure  sectors 5 through  debt  and  equity  issuances  in the capital market was just over ₹1,00,000 crore during FY24. Real estate investment trusts REITs) have raised ₹18,840 crore from year 2019 to 2024 while Infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) raised a total of ₹1,11,294 crore in the last five years (2019-2024).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chart XII.7.

Web-based  toolkits,  post-award contract management toolkit and contingent liability for project sponsoring authorities have been developed to help them in PPP structuring.\n\n## National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP)\n\n12.10.  NMP  was  announced  in  August  2021  on  the  principle  of  'asset  creation  through monetisation'  i.e.,  tapping  private  sector  investment  for  new  infrastructure  creation.  The aggregate monetisation potential under NMP was estimated at ₹6.0 lakh crore through core assets of the Government, over four-years from FY22 to FY25 6 . The pipeline contained more than 20 asset classes across 12 Ministries.\n\n12.11.  Ministries are proactively working on developing a pipeline and transactions have been undertaken in line with their strategic initiatives. During the first two years, i.e., 2021-22 and 2022-23, transactions aggregating to about ₹2.3 lakh crore in accruals or private investments were  completed  under  the  core  asset  monetisation  programme.  Further,  in  2023-24, transactions aggregating to ₹1.51 lakh crore in accruals or private investments were completed, 1.55 times those achieved in 2021-22.",
