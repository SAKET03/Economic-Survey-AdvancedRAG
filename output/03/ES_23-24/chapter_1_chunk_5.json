The economy grew at 8.2% in FY24, posting growth of over 7% for a third consecutive year. The growth has been inclusive with a reduction in unemployment and multi-dimensional poverty and an increase in labor force participation. The global economy achieved greater stability in 2023, with a growth of 3.2%. However, uncertainty stemming from adverse geopolitical developments remained elevated. The Indian economy's growth was driven by stable consumption demand and steadily improving investment demand. The gross value added (GVA) at 2011-12 prices grew by 7.2% in FY24, with growth remaining broad-based. The shares of the agriculture, industry, and services sector in overall GVA at current prices were 17.7%, 27.6%, and 54.7% respectively in FY24. The manufacturing sector grew by 9.9% in FY24, while construction activities registered a growth of 9.9%. The services sector demonstrated double-digit growth in FY24, with financial and professional services being a major driver of growth. Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE) grew by 4.0% in real terms in FY24. Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) continues to emerge as an important driver of growth. The banking and financial sector is well-positioned to cater to the growing financing needs of investment demand. The fiscal deficit of the Union Government has been brought down from 6.4% of GDP in FY23 to 5.6% of GDP in FY24. The revenue receipts of the union government increased by 14.5% in FY24. The growth in gross tax revenue (GTR) was estimated to be 13.4% in FY24. The government has followed a path of fiscal consolidation while continuing to protect the vulnerable sections and investing in the productive capacity of the economy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has maintained policy rates at a high level to battle inflationary pressures. The Indian economy is expected to grow at 6.5-7% in FY25, with risks evenly balanced.\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Inclusive Growth\n\n## INCLUSIVE GROWTH\n\n## Shift in the approach to welfare\n\n1.47  India's  social  welfare  approach  has  undergone  a  shift  from  an  input-based  approach to  outcome-based  empowerment.  Saturation  of  basic  necessities  has  been  recognised  as imperative to achieve this, thus impelling an array of flagship initiatives. Government initiatives like providing free-of-cost gas connections under PM Ujjwala Yojana, building toilets under\n\n39  https://tinyurl.com/2dbutsvt\n\n40  https://tinyurl.com/5xrrja3c\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\nthe Swacch Bharat Mission, opening bank accounts under Jan Dhan Yojana, building pucca houses under PM-AWAS Yojana have improved capabilities and enhanced opportunities for the underprivileged sections.\n\n1.48  The approach also involves the targeted implementation of reforms for last-mile service delivery to truly realise the maxim of 'no person left behind'. These include the Aspirational Districts Programme, launched in 2018, for focusing efforts on the most backward regions, the success of which inspired the Aspirational Blocks Programme launched in 2023; the Vibrant Villages  Programme  for  border  areas;  and  more  recently,  the  Viksit  Bharat  Sankalp  Yatra, which saw the participation of 15 crore people in two months starting 15 November 2023 41 . The digitisation of healthcare, education and governance helps improve the gains for every rupee spent. The Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme and Jan Dhan Yojana-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity have been boosters of fiscal  efficiency  and  minimisation  of  leakages,  with  â‚¹36.9  lakh  crore having been transferred via DBT since its inception in 2013 (DBT Portal. 42 ).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.49  On the employment  front,  according  to the annual  PLFS,  the all-India  annual unemployment rate (persons aged 15 years and above, as per usual status) has been declining since the pandemic. This has been accompanied by a rise in the labour force participation rate and worker-to-population ratio. Even by the relatively strict standards of current weekly status, employment has recovered from the  pandemic  in  urban  and  rural  areas.  From  the  gender perspective, the female labour force participation rate has been rising for six years, i.e., from 23.3 per cent in 2017-18 to 37 per cent in 2022-23, driven mainly by the rising participation of rural women.\n\n41    15 Crore Participants in Two Months Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra draws huge crowds across many states, 17 Jan 2024 (https://tinyurl.com/55xae4b3)\n\n42  https://dbtbharat.gov.in/\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.50  As a result of the systematic focus on addressing individual deprivations, the incidence of poverty has reduced remarkably. This is reflected in the steep decline in the headcount ratio of multidimensionally poor between 2015-16 and 2022-23, as per NITI Aayog's discussion paper on multidimensional poverty in India 43 .\n\n1.51 The initiatives in the social sector have also translated into rising consumption spending, as evident from the results of the latest Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2022-23. The HCES throws many reassuring findings on inclusive growth in the past decade. The monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) in 2022-23 increased in real terms in both rural and urban areas over 2011-12. The difference between rural and urban MPCE also declined in percentage terms.\n\n<!-- image -->",
