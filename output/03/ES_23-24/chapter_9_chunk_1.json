See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Indian agriculture sector has grown at an average growth rate of 4.18% per year over the last five years. The sector provides livelihood support to about 42.3% of the population and contributes 18.2% to the country's GDP. In 2023-24, the growth rate of the agriculture sector stood at 1.4%, which is below 4.7% in 2022-23, mainly due to a drop in foodgrain production caused by delayed and poor monsoons.\\n\\nThe country has a comfortable stock of foodgrains, with around 40% distributed to two-thirds of the population free of cost. India exports more than 7% of its food grains. However, the sector faces challenges such as low productivity levels, impact of variability in weather, fragmented land holdings, and inadequate marketing infrastructure.\\n\\nThe government has implemented various initiatives to improve productivity, including the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme, income support through Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PMKISAN), and promotion of sustainable practices through organic and natural farming. The digitalisation initiatives in Agriculture are expected to empower farmers through better decision-making tools.\\n\\nThe livestock and fisheries sectors have performed better than traditional crops, with an increase in their share in agriculture Gross Value Added (GVA) from 24.38% and 4.44% in 2014-15 to 30.23% and 7.25% in 2022-23, respectively. The fisheries sector has received support through programs like the Fisheries Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) and Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY).\\n\\nThe government has also promoted crop diversification, with a focus on pulses, oilseeds, and nutri-cereals. The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) have been implemented to enhance production and productivity of foodgrain and commercial crops.\\n\\nThe Gross Capital Formation (GCF) of the agriculture sector has grown steadily, with a rate of 19.04% in 2022-23. However, there is a need to further boost agriculture investment, especially in the context of doubling farmers' income. The average annual growth in GCF from 2016-17 to 2022-23 was 9.70%.\\n\\nThe Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has streamlined agricultural credit accessibility, with 7.5 crores KCC issued with a limit of ₹9.4 lakh crores. The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) provides a safety net against crop losses, with 5549.40 Lakh farmer applications insured under the scheme since 2016-17.\\n\\nThe e-NAM Scheme has been implemented to promote efficiency in agriculture marketing and improve price discovery. As of March 2024, more than 1.77 crore farmers and 2.56 lakh traders have been registered on the e-NAM portal.\\n\\nThe government has also taken initiatives to promote investment in agriculture and allied sectors, including the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme and the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF). The AIF provides medium-term debt financing for post-harvest management and community farming projects, with an investment of ₹73194 Crore mobilized as of July 2024.\\n\\nThe Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY) provides credit-linked financial assistance through grants-in-aid to build efficient supply chain management from farm to retail. The scheme has been approved for 1044 projects till March 2024, with a total project cost of ₹32.78 Thousand Crore and approved subsidy of ₹9.3 Thousand Crore.\\n\\nThe National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture aims to make Indian agriculture more resilient to climate change. The government has also promoted organic and natural farming, with 68.05 lakh hectares brought under organic farming by 2022-23.\\n\\nThe Indian Council on Agricultural Research (ICAR) is the apex organization in agriculture research, with 347 varieties/hybrids of 44 crops released and 99 varieties of horticultural crops notified for commercial cultivation in 2022-23. The food processing industry in India is one of the largest employers in organized manufacturing, with a 12.02% share in total employment.\\n\\nThe Production Linked Incentive Scheme for the Food Processing Industry supports the creation of global food manufacturing champions. The PM Formalization of Micro Food Processing Enterprises scheme provides credit-linked subsidy and capacity building, including marketing and branding support, with 3,53,608 applications received and a loan amount of ₹6.94 Thousand Crore sanctioned.\\n\\nThe government has also taken initiatives to improve food management, including procurement of foodgrains at MSP and distribution of foodgrains at less than economic cost. The economic cost of rice and wheat witnessed a significant increase during the last few years, with the economic cost of rice and wheat for 2023-24 (RE) at ₹3931.34 per quintal and ₹2709.59 per quintal, respectively.\\n\\nThe performance of the agriculture sector remains critical for the economy's growth, with an average growth rate of 4.18% over the last five years. The sector's growth is expected to be driven by high-value agriculture, including fruits and vegetables, fisheries, poultry, dairy, and buffalo meat. Promoting crop diversification, investment in agri-infrastructure, credit accessibility, and market institutions are crucial for sustainable agriculture practices and improving farm income.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# AGRICULTURE AND FOOD MANAGEMENT: PLENTY OF UPSIDE LEFT IF WE GET IT RIGHT\n\n## AGRICULTURE AND FOOD MANAGEMENT: PLENTY OF UPSIDE LEFT IF WE GET IT RIGHT\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn the last five years, the agriculture sector has grown at an average growth rate of 4.18 per cent per year. The country also has a comfortable stock of foodgrains, around 40 per cent 1   of which is distributed to two-thirds of the population free of cost. India exports more than 7 per cent 2  of its food grains. The growth in the agriculture and allied sectors has contributed positively to the growth of the Indian economy.\n\nHowever, specific challenges remain. Low productivity levels, the impact of variability in weather, fragmented land holdings and inadequate marketing infrastructure affect agriculture performance. The chapter discusses these aspects while also focussing on government interventions  in  the  crop,  livestock,  animal  husbandry  and  fisheries  to enhance investment and productivity, provide reasonable returns to farmers through the minimum support price (MSP), improve access to high-quality inputs and enable better extension services. Looking ahead, the digitalisation initiatives in Agriculture are expected to empower farmers through better decision-making tools. The chapter also discusses welfare schemes like PM Gareeb Kalyan Yojana (PMGKAY), the National Food Security Act (NFSA) and India's food management programme, including food procurement and allocation.",
