The Indian stock market was among the best-performing markets, with India\\'s Nifty50 index ascending by 26.8% during FY24. The market capitalization of the Indian stock market has seen a remarkable surge, with the market capitalization to GDP ratio being the fifth largest in the world. \\n\\nThe pension sector witnessed a robust increase in subscribers and assets under management. Supported by regulatory measures and the vision to achieve \\'Insurance for all by 2047\\', India is poised to emerge as one of the fastest-growing insurance markets over the next five years. \\n\\nThe significant increase in retail investors in the stock market calls for careful consideration. The possibility of overconfidence leading to speculation and the expectation of even greater returns, which might not align with the real market conditions, is a serious concern. \\n\\nFor a developing economy such as India, the financial sector needs to support the banking sector and fill the gap in capital required for the economy\\'s growth. Therefore, the financial sector should expand at a pace that is in lockstep with economic growth. \\n\\nThe Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) maintained the policy repo rate at 6.5% in FY24, focusing on withdrawing accommodation to ensure that inflation gradually aligns with the target while supporting growth. \\n\\nThe growth in Broad Money (M3) was 11.2% (YoY) as of March 22, 2024, compared to 9% a year ago. Bank credit growth has sustained momentum during FY24, with broad-based growth across sectors. Credit disbursal by Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) stood at â‚¹164.3 lakh crore, growing by 20.2% at the end of March 2024. \\n\\nThe gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs continued its downward trend, reaching a 12-year low of 2.8% at the end of March 2024. The net interest margin (NIM) of SCBs remained robust at 3.6% in March 2024. \\n\\nThe yield on assets further improved due to the rise in interest rates. The Indian banking system remains sound and resilient, backed by high capital adequacy ratio, improved asset quality, and robust earnings growth.\"\\n }\\n }\\n]'}}\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Financial Intermediation\n\n## FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION\n\n2.14 Financial  development  and  economic  growth  are  inextricably  linked,  and  financial intermediation is the pathway through which the former translates into the latter. Financial intermediation helps in the efficient allocation of limited resources. Renowned economist Joseph Schumpeter believed  that  the  services  provided  by  financial  intermediaries,  viz.  mobilising\n\nsavings,  extending  credit,  storing  assets,  growing  them,  managing  risk,  and  facilitating transactions, were essential for technological innovation and economic development. 9 Financial intermediation also facilitates and encourages the inflows of foreign capital. Empirical studies 10 show that efficient and developed financial markets can lead to increased and inclusive economic growth by improving the allocation and utilisation of savings and ensuring access to finance to all sections of society, including vulnerable groups and small and medium-sized firms.\n\n2.15 Financial  development  parameters  should  not  only  be  sound,  but  they  also  ensure the  system's  financial  stability  as  a  whole.  This  requires  indicators  such  as  Capital  to  Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR) , liquid assets to deposits, and short-term credit to be within manageable limits. Further, an essential part of financial sector development is implementing robust policies for regulation and supervision of all the financial market entities, market players, and financial instruments. Coordinating amongst Regulators is paramount in this regard.",
