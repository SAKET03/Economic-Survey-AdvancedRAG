See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Indian government has initiated several measures to overcome the pandemic-driven slowdown in the economy, including increasing capital expenditure, particularly in high-quality physical and social infrastructure facilities. The capital expenditure of the government has seen an almost three-fold increase in FY24 relative to FY20 levels, with major beneficiaries being key foundational assets like roads and railways.\\n\\nThe government has also implemented institutional and procedural reforms to facilitate project execution and timely issue resolutions, including initiatives to enhance private sector participation through PPPs, and measures like National Infrastructure Pipeline and Project Monitoring Group. The chapter highlights that with increased public investment over the last five years, India has witnessed significant expansion in physical and digital connectivity and social infrastructure.\\n\\nThe creation of resilient, world-class infrastructure is a key plank of India's policy strategy to become Viksit Bharat @2047. The chapter examines recent developments in India's infrastructure space, with a special focus on progress achieved in FY24. The chapter is divided into six sections, investigating infrastructure financing, sectoral developments, challenges, and outlook.\\n\\nInfrastructure financing in India still relies heavily on capital expenditure by the Union and State Governments. Despite financial innovations, public expenditure continues to play a central role in funding large-scale infrastructure projects. The capital expenditure of the Union Government increased by 2.2 times from FY21 to FY24, while that of State governments increased by 2.1 times during the same period.\\n\\nThe share of gross budgetary support to two key connectivity segments, Railways and National Highway Authority of India, in the total capital expenditure of the Union Government increased from 36.4% in FY21 to 42.9% in FY24. The aggregate investible resources of CPSEs, consisting of GBS and resources raised by CPSEs, have been optimized to reduce borrowing costs.\\n\\nThe net flow of funds to infrastructure sectors through bank credit between March 2023 to March 2024 was around ₹79,000 crore. The credit growth to infrastructure sectors in FY24 recovered to 6.5%, as against the growth of 2.3% in FY23. The gross inflow of external commercial borrowings to infrastructure sectors picked up to USD 9.05 billion in FY24.\\n\\nThe resource mobilization by infrastructure sectors through debt and equity issuances in the capital market was just over ₹1,00,000 crore during FY24. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have raised ₹18,840 crore from 2019 to 2024, while Infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) raised a total of ₹1,11,294 crore in the last five years.\\n\\nThe National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) was announced in August 2021, with an aggregate monetization potential of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years. During the first two years, transactions aggregating to about ₹2.3 lakh crore in accruals or private investments were completed under the core asset monetization program.\\n\\nThe development of expressways and corridors, along with transformative initiatives, has been the highlight of the recent road sector growth journey. The Bharatmala Pariyojana has significantly expanded the national highway network, increasing the length of high-speed corridors by 12 times and 4-lane roads by 2.6 times between 2014 and 2024.\\n\\nThe average pace of NH construction increased by ~3 times from 11.7 km per day in FY14 to ~34 km per day by FY24. The Indian Railways' capital expenditure increased by 77% over the past 5 years, with significant investments in new lines, gauge conversion, and doubling.\\n\\nThe power transmission system in India is connected into one grid running on one frequency, with an inter-regional capability of transferring 1,18,740 megawatts. The peak electricity demand increased by 13% to 243 GW in FY24. The renewable energy sector received approximately USD 17.88 billion as FDI from April 2000 until March 2024.\\n\\nThe Jal Jeevan Mission was launched in August 2019 to provide a tap water connection to every rural household by 2024 with a total outlay of ₹3.6 lakh crore. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) was launched in 2015 to provide pucca houses with basic amenities to all eligible beneficiaries in urban areas.\\n\\nThe Smart Cities Mission was launched in June 2015 to promote cities that provide core infrastructure, clean and sustainable environment, and give a decent quality of life to their citizens. The Swachh Bharat Mission Urban focuses on ensuring every citizen, including the poor household of urban India, has access to sanitation facilities.\\n\\nThe tourism sector has seen significant growth, with 29 new sites identified for development under the PRASHAD scheme. The Indian space sector has seen remarkable progress, with 55 active space assets, including 18 communication satellites and 20 Earth Observation satellites.\\n\\nThe digital infrastructure in India has been improving, with the usage and underlying technologies of telecommunications undergoing massive changes. The Government has introduced guidelines for the Spectrum Regulatory Sandbox to foster innovation and enhance ease of doing business in the telecommunications sector.\\n\\nThe electronics and information technology sector has seen significant growth, with the Government envisioning the India AI program as a mission-centric approach for leveraging transformative technologies. The India AI program aims to democratize access to AI innovation pillars and ensure global competitiveness of India's AI ecosystem.\\n\\nThe chapter highlights several challenges, including land-related issues, skill demands, need to improve private participation, climate and environmental sustainability, and lack of aggregation of financial flows into infrastructure. The government has launched several initiatives to address these challenges, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline, Project Monitoring Group, and PM GatiShakti National Master Plan.\\n\\nThe National Logistics Policy was launched in September 2022 to complement PMGS-NMP, aiming to drive business competitiveness through an integrated, efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective logistics network. The policy aims to reduce the cost of logistics, improve the Logistics Performance Index ranking, and create a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem.\\n\\nOverall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in India's infrastructure space, highlighting the progress achieved in FY24, and the challenges and opportunities ahead.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Facilitation and addressing the bottlenecks\n\n## FACILITATION AND ADDRESSING THE BOTTLENECKS\n\n## National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP)\n\n12.70.  The portal provides opportunities for Ministries and States/UTs to collate all major infrastructure  projects  at  a  single  location,  thus  acting  as  a  centralised  portal  to  track  and review project progress across all economic and social infrastructure sub-sectors. The portal also enables project-sponsoring authorities to showcase investment opportunities to national and international investors.\n\n12.71. The  Government  launched  the  NIP  with  a  forward-looking  approach  and  with  a projected infrastructure investment of around ₹111 lakh crore during FY20-25 to provide highquality infrastructure across the country 30 . NIP includes infrastructure projects of more than ₹100 crore each covering greenfield and brownfield investments. As of 12 April 2024, out of\n\n30 Report of the Task Force National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), 2020 - https://tinyurl.com/3j48tuhj\n\nthe  total  capital  outlay  under  NIP,  the  transportation  sector  dominates  with  a  contribution of  58  per  cent,  followed  by  the  energy  sector  at  24  per  cent,  and  the  water  and  sanitation sector at 12 per cent, and balance five per cent by other sectors such as social infrastructure, communication, etc.\n\n12.72.  NIP currently has over 9,666 projects and schemes covering 37 sub-sectors (as on 12th April  2024)  that  are  hosted  and  monitored  through  the  India  Investment  Grid  (NIP-PMG) integrated portal. Out of these projects, 4,413 projects (46 per cent) are under implementation while 2,062 projects (21 per cent) have been completed.\n\n## Project Monitoring Group (PMG)\n\n12.73. PMG is an institutional mechanism for expeditious resolution of issues and regulatory bottlenecks in projects with an investment of ₹500 crores and above. The PMG mechanism allows project proponents to raise issues with concerned the Government agencies that are causing hindrances in the implementation of projects.\n\n12.74. PMG has facilitated resolution of 6,867 issues in 1,443 projects worth ₹46.1 lakh crore. The PMG portal has on-boarded 2,457 projects worth ₹62.5 lakh crore until March 2024 which consist  of  all  important  mega  infrastructure  projects  including  high-impact  PM  GatiShakti projects and critical infrastructure gap projects.\n\n## PM GatiShakti National Master Plan (PMGS-NMP)\n\n12.75. PMGS-NMP  is  a  whole-of-government  approach  adopted  to  facilitate  integrated planning of multimodal infrastructure through collaboration among the Ministries concerned. PMGS-NMP has been adopted at the State and Centre level to assess last-mile connectivity gaps and ensure seamless movement of people and goods. This is a transformative approach for planning multimodal infrastructure connectivity to economic nodes, thereby bringing logistics efficiency.\n\n12.76.  As on March 2024, 43 Ministries have been onboarded on PMGS-NMP portal. 1,530 data layers (642 Ministry data layers &amp; 888 State data layers) of Ministries and States have been uploaded on the PMGS-NMP portal. 16 Ministries have a dedicated PMGS cell which has streamlined project planning. 22 social sector Ministries onboarded with over 200 data layers mapped on portal. All 36 States and Union Territories have formed State-level institutional mechanism and State Master Plan portals and 533 projects have been planned on NMP. Network Planning Group, a central-level institutional mechanism of the PMGS-NMP has evaluated 149 project proposals with total estimated project cost of ₹13.3 lakh crore.\n\n## Box XII.25: Implementation of NLP gains steam\n\nlndia's focus on improving logistics infrastructure has led to an improvement of six places from 44 in 2018 to 38 in 2023 out of 139 countries in the Logistics Performance lndex of the World Bank.\n\nNational Logistics Policy (NLP) was launched in September 2022 to complement PMGSNMP i.e., to drive business competitiveness through an integrated, efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective logistics network by leveraging best-in-class technology, and processes. The aim is to reduce the cost of logistics, improve the Logistics Performance Index ranking, and create a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem. NLP is being implemented through a comprehensive logistics action plan. The progress under each of these action areas is below:\n\n## i. Integrated Digital Logistics Systems:\n\n- Unified  Logistics  Integrated  Platform,  a  single  window  platform,  integrating  36 logistics-related digital systems/portals across eight Ministries and providing realtime information on 1,800 data fields has been developed.\n- For tracking 100 per cent of India's containerised EXIM cargo, a Logistics Data Bank has been developed which uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), IoT, and Big data analytics and is integrated with 28 port terminals of India, over 95 toll plazas, 407  container  freight  station/inland  container  depot  and  empty  yards,  56  SEZs, three integrated check posts.\n- ii.    Service Quality Standards: An e-book has been developed on warehousing standards delineating existing standards issued by the Bureau of Indian Standards and Warehouse Development and Regulatory Authority.\n- iii.   Capacity Building: Training courses on logistics and PMGS-NMP are being integrated with central and state training institutes.\n- iv.    State engagement: States are developing State Logistics Plans aligned with NLP to give policy focus at the State level. 26 States have notified their State Logistics policies. An annual 'Logistics Ease Across Different States (LEADS)' survey is also deployed in all State and Union Territories.\n- v. EXIM Logistics: To  streamline  EXIM  logistics,  infrastructure  gaps  are  addressed through  action  plans  developed  by  the  National  Committee  on  Trade  Facilitation (NCTF). NCTF Working Groups formulated a National Trade Facilitation Action Plan 2020-23. The action plan for 2024-26 is being developed.\n- vi.    Services  Improvement Framework: The Service Improvement Group has been established with the involvement of over 30 business associations. Critical issues are raised by associations on the E-LoGS platform.\n- vii.    Sectoral Plans for Efficient Logistics: This aims to address the needs and challenges in the logistics sector, particularly of bulk and breakbulk cargo. Coal Logistics Plan and Policy  was  launched  in  February  2024.  Comprehensive  Port  Connectivity  Plan  was prepared in 2022 that identified 107 port projects to strengthen connectivity between ports, railways, roadways, and inland waterways.\n- viii.
