  "content": "Chapter 3 Summary:\nThe chapter discusses India's inflation management, focusing on prices and inflation. The pandemic and geopolitical tensions presented challenges to global economic stability, affecting India significantly. Supply disruptions and increased commodity prices led to elevated inflationary pressures in FY23 and FY24. However, prudent monetary policy responses and calibrated trade policy measures helped reduce core inflation to a four-year low in FY24. Food inflation was mitigated through administrative actions, including dynamic stock management and subsidized provision of essential food items. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) inflation projections indicate a benign and range-bound inflation outlook for India. India's retail inflation was 5.4% in FY24, the lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic. The inflation rate was within the target range of 2-6% in 2023. India's inflation management was relatively better compared to developed and emerging economies. The chapter highlights key policy recommendations, including strengthening price monitoring mechanisms, increasing domestic production of essential food items, and improving storage and processing facilities for vegetables. The RBI and IMF project India's consumer price inflation to align towards the inflation target in FY26, with projected inflation rates of 4.5% in FY25 and 4.1% in FY26. The World Bank expects a 3% decline in the commodity price index in 2024 and a 4% decrease in 2025. The chapter emphasizes the importance of focused efforts to increase the production of major oilseeds, pulses, and other essential food items to stabilize domestic prices and mitigate import dependence.\n\nSubchapter 3 Content:\n# Domestic Retail Inflation\n\n## DOMESTIC RETAIL INFLATION\n\n## Retail inflation moderated gradually in FY24\n\n3.7. Since  2020,  countries  have  been  facing  challenges  in  controlling  inflation.  In  FY23, Consumer Price Index (CPI) based retail inflation in India was primarily influenced by higher food inflation, while core inflation remained moderate. Externally, the Russia-Ukraine war led to price pressures, while domestically, excessive heat in the summer and uneven rainfall put pressure on food prices.\n\n4     Jahan, Sarwat.

However, since May 2022, monetary policy broadly focused on absorbing excess liquidity in the system by increasing the policy repo rate by 250 basis points from 4 per cent in May 2022 to 6.5 per cent in February 2023. Thereafter, the policy rate was kept unchanged by focusing on the gradual withdrawal of accommodation, aiming to align inflation with the target, while simultaneously fostering growth. Consequently, the persistent and sticky core inflation observed in FY23 declined to 3.1 per cent in June 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3.9. As the global energy price index experienced a sharp decline in FY24, retail fuel inflation also stayed low. The Central Government's announcement of price cuts for LPG, petrol, and diesel led to lower LPG and petroleum product inflation. In August 2023, the price of a domestic LPG cylinder was reduced by ₹200 per cylinder in all markets across the country. As a result, LPG inflation rate has been in the deflationary zone since September 2023. Again in March 2024, the price of non-subsidised LPG cylinders was reduced by ₹100 per cylinder. Similarly, in March 2024, the Central Government lowered the prices of petrol and diesel by ₹2 per litre. Subsequently, retail inflation in petrol and diesel used in vehicles moved to the deflationary zone in March 2024. Additionally, global commodity prices declined in 2023, reducing price pressure  in  energy,  metals,  minerals,  and  agricultural  commodities  through  the  imported inflation  channel.  Low  fuel  and  core  inflation  ensured  a  downward  trajectory  for  headline inflation, despite volatility in food prices in FY24.\n\n3.10. Thus, moderation in inflation was largely the result of prudent administrative measures and monetary policies implemented during the post-pandemic economic recovery phase. As per the recent data released by MoSPI, the retail inflation rate was 5.1 per cent in June 2024. In view of this, the following section examines the detailed trends and patterns in core and food inflation.\n\n## Chart III.7: 'Clothing &amp; Footwear' and 'Fuel &amp; Light' groups saw a substantial decline in inflation rate in FY24\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Consumer Price Indices released by CSO, MoSPI\n\n## Chart III.9: Decrease in LPG inflation rate due to price cut/subsidy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Consumer Price Indices released by CSO, MoSPI\n\n## Chart III.8: Decreasing global energy index in FY24\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Chart III.10: Decline in petrol and diesel inflation rate due to price reduction measures\n\n<!-- image -->",
