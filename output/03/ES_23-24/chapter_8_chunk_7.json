Measures are being taken by Government to translate India's demographic dividend into a productivity dividend by enabling job and entrepreneurial opportunities that are in sync with the aspirations and abilities of India's youth. It is partnering with the industry to enhance skilling with employability (See Box VIII.7).\n\n8.78  Over the period 2017-18 to 2022-23, there is a significant improvement in the proportion of skilled people across all socio-economic classifications, including rural, urban and gender classification, as indicated in Chart VIII.28. According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) report 2022-23, 4.4 per cent of the youth in the age cohort of 15-29 years have received formal  vocational/technical  training,  while  another  16.6  per  cent  received  training  through informal sources.\n\n93    Confederation  for  Indian  Industry  (2024).

In cognisance of this, the Skill India mission actively collaborates with the industry through National  Skill  Development  Council  (NSDC)-driven  partnerships  for  skill  development, reskilling, and upskilling. Until March 2024 (starting date to be added), 131 projects have been  undertaken  by  NSDC,  with  62  corporate  organisations  benefitting  over  3.10  lakh persons across the country, including 42 aspirational districts.\n\n## Skill Impact Bond\n\nLaunched in 2021, the Skill Impact Bond leverages an innovative and results-based finance mechanism - Development Impact Bond 99  model to attract private sector funds and expertise for  skill  development,  job  placements,  and  retention.  This  initiative  by  NSDC  and  its coalition partners 100  targets training 50,000 youth, ensuring at least 60 per cent are female, through selected and monitored NSDC-affiliated training partners over four years. Between November 2021 and March 2024, 29,365 candidates have been enrolled over five cohorts, 23,464 have been certified, 19,209 have been placed and 13,853 reported job retentions. The program has reported 74 per cent women enrolment so far.\n\nFurther, the Directorate General of Training (DGT) has also taken the following initiatives under Industry Partnerships:\n\n- Under  the Flexi  MoU  Scheme with  prominent  industry  partners  such  as  Maruti Suzuki  India  Limited,  Gurugram,  NMDC  Chhattisgarh,  Toyota  Kirloskar  Motor  Pvt. Ltd, etc. - about 9600 trainees have been trained under this initiative from March 2019 to March 2024.\n- Under the Dual System of Training (DST) initiative, skilling institution trainees get first-hand workplace experience. During the 2022 session, about 978 ITIs and 37,865 trainees were covered under DST.\n- DGT\t has\t collaborated\t with\t IT\t frontlines like  IBM,  Microsoft,  Cisco,  Adobe, Amazon Web services, etc., to enable trainees to become Industry Ready as per IR 4.0, and more than 21.5 lakh trainees have been trained under these collaborations between November 2019 and March 2024.\n- Besides\tmandated\ttraining\tof\tInstructor\ttrainees,\tNSTIs\tare\talso Skilling/Re-skilling/ Upskilling  the  existing  industry  workforce by  partnering  with  ISRO,  ONGC, Indian Railways, Naval Ship Repair yard, Naval Ship Dockyard, and BHEL. Under this initiative, about 1400 participants were trained during the FY24 session.\n\n99    Impact bonds shift the focus from inputs to performance and results. Rather than a government or a donor financing a project upfront, private investors initially finance the initiative and are repaid by 'outcome funders', only  if  agreed-upon  outcomes  are  achieved.  This  mechanism  creates  incentives  for  every  partner  to  achieve learning outcomes and not just deliver services.\n\n100    Partners comprise of the Children's Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF), JSW Foundation, HSBC India, and Dubai Cares as outcome funders, the British Asian Trust as the transaction manager, USAID and FCDO (UK Government)  as  technical  partners,  Oxford  Policy  Manager  as  the  independent  evaluator,  and  NSDC  and Dalberg Advisors as performance managers. NSDC and MSDF are the risk investors that have committed $4 million to provide upfront working capital to the service providers.\n\n- DGT\t is\t also collaborating with industry\t partners\t for infrastructure development/upgradation in  NSTIs/ITIs. Notable collaborators include Dassault for Aeronautical Structure and Equipment Fitter, Pidilite and Jaguar for the Plumbing sector, Skoda for the automobile industry, and HAL and Siemens for advanced CNC machinery training, among others.\n\n8.81  The PM Vishwakarma scheme to provide end-to-end support to artisans and craftspeople is a new scheme (briefed in Box VIII.8) to address various constraints of artisans to upgrade their enterprise, thus infusing the traditional vocations with dynamism.\n\n## Box VIII.8: PM Vishwakarma Scheme: Making progress\n\nThe PM Vishwakarma programme was launched in September 2023 for recognition, skill upgradation, collateral free credit and marketing support to traditional artisan/craftsperson working  with  traditional  tools.  18  trades  are  covered  under  PM  Vishwakarma  Scheme, including tailors, barbers, masons, carpenter, blacksmith, basket weaver, potter, cobbler, traditional toys maker, fishing net maker, etc. It is a Central Sector Scheme with practically useful components including recognition through PM Vishwakarma Certificate and ID Card, Skill Upgradation, Toolkit Incentive, Credit Support, Incentive for Digital Transactions and Marketing Support. Under the skill upgradation module, 5-7 days of basic skill training and advanced\t15\tdays\toptional\tskill\ttraining\tis\tprovided\twith\tstipend\tof\t₹\t500\tper\tday\tto\toffset wage\tloss\tand\ta\ttravel\tallowance\tof\t₹\t1000.\n\nCurrently 1,533 Centres covering 365 districts in 25 states/UTs are implementing training and additional 2000 centres are ready. For ease of credit, two bank officials each in all the 766 districts on pan India basis have been designated for information on know-how of availing credit under the scheme to the registered Vishwakarma. As on 27th May 2024, 2.14 crore applications have been received and 11.5 lakh have been verified through a 3-level verification,  showing the latent demand for the scheme. 4.37 lakh candidates have been trained/undergoing training under the programme.\n\n8.82  To  maximise  the  outcomes  from  skilling  initiatives,  convergence,  and  utilisation  of synergies with other employment-centric programmes would mutually benefit the two verticals. Linking skill development with PLI scheme and employment-linked incentive schemes in highgrowth potential sectors like toy, apparel, tourism, logistics, textiles, leather sector etc. would aid upgrading of skills as production moves up the value chain. On the apprenticeship promotion front,  there  remains  considerable  scope  to  add  flexibility  to  the  regulatory  framework,  as elaborated in Box VIII.9.\n\n## Box VIII.9: Re-calibrating the apprenticeship framework\n\nLearning while doing has been considered the best way of learning and this is the best way to bridge the gap from theory to practice. In the manufacturing /industry parlance, it is termed 'apprenticeship'\t and\t in\t the\t knowledge-based\t professions\t it\t goes\t by\t 'internships'.\t Such learning opportunities act as the bridge that aids people to cross over from informal work to formal employment or to smooth the move from academics to the workplace. They are an essential component of the skilling ecosystem which is the backbone for both employment and entrepreneurship.\n\nThe Apprentices Act, 1961 (Act) provides for establishments in all sectors of manufacturing and services with more than 30 employees to mandatorily undertake apprenticeships in a range from 2.5 - 15 per cent of their workforce 101 . Any person over the age of 14 years and with a minimum education of 5 th  standard is eligible to take up apprenticeship. The Rules provide 6\t-\t36-month\tduration\tapprenticeship\tprogrammes\twith\ta\tminimum\tstipend\tof\t₹5000\t9000 per month to apprentices and the rate is linked to the educational qualification of the candidate. The Act and the Rules have been amended in 2014, 2015, and 2019, to make it more liberal for establishments and apprentices.\n\nThe National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme 102  (NAPS) was introduced in August 2016 to meet the demand for a skilled workforce, promote the industrial economy, and provide experiential learning opportunities to the youth. The scheme governs the engagement of apprentices under the Act and is funded 100 per cent by the Ministry of Skill Development and  Entrepreneurship.  It  incentivises  establishments  by  reimbursing  25  per  cent  of  the prescribed\tstipend\t(subject\tto\ta\tmaximum\tof\t₹1500\tper\tmonth)\tand\talso\tpartially\tsupports the cost of basic training. The scheme covers apprenticeship in over 261 designated trades, managed through the Director General of Training and the state Governments, and over 200 optional trades, managed by the NSDC, in over 37 industry sectors. Under the scheme 103 , over 2.21 lakh establishments are registered for taking up apprentices and over 32.38 lakh apprentices have been engaged from FY17 to FY24.\n\nWhile the NAPS supports apprentices who have minimum formal education the National Apprenticeship  Training  Scheme 104   (NATS)  covers  Graduate,  Diploma  students  and Vocational  certificate  holders  for  practical,  hands-on  On-the-Job-Training  based  skilling opportunities with a duration ranging from 6 months to 1 year. The scheme, implemented by the Ministry of Education, has over 43,000 registered establishments and 28.66 lakh students who have been engaged under the scheme. It supports 50 per cent of the cost of such apprenticeship stipend to the establishments.\n\n101    FAQs - Apprenticeship under the Apprentices Act, 1961 accessed at https://nsdcindia.org/sites/all/themes/ ibees/pdf/apprenticeship-faqs.pdf\n\n102    Guidelines  for  Implementation  of  National  Apprenticeship  Promotion  Scheme-2  (NAPS-2)  accessed  at file:///C:/Users/Dell/Downloads/NAPS+2.0\\_Guidelines\\_25-08-2023.pdf\n\n103    NAPS Dashboard accessed at https://dashboard.apprenticeshipindia.org/\n\n104    Content as accessed at :: National Apprenticeship Training Scheme (NATS) :: (education.gov.in).\n\n## Challenges\n\nApprenticeship training programs in India have the potential to bridge the skills gap in the workforce and enhance the employability of vocational students. Empirical evidence shows that, in a smooth functioning apprenticeship ecosystem, a large share of firms (30 per cent in Germany and 60 per cent in Switzerland) recoup their investment of hiring an apprentice by  the  end  of  the  training  period,  while  being  guided  by  their  cost-benefit  analysis  in hiring apprentices (Muehlemann and Wolter 2014). 105  Firms also retain the most eligible apprentices while the others seek employment elsewhere.\n\nThere exist significant challenges in the Indian apprenticeship ecosystem, such as lack of coordination between education institutions and industry, inadequate infrastructure, gaps in  the  regulatory  framework (Ravichandran 2023). 106  Besides, the negative perception of vocational training as being inferior to academic education is one of the biggest challenges (Gupta and Dharap 2022). 107\n\nThe outcomes from the apprenticeship schemes signal scope for improvement. The NAPS 2.0 set an ambitious target of enrol 46 lakh apprentices in the four years from 2022-23 to 202526, whereas the enrolments from 2016-17 to 2021-22 were 15.96 lakh. The technological intervention of having a unified portal and moving payments to the direct benefit transfer system may have helped increase enrolments from 2.90 lakh in FY 21 to 5.80 lakh in FY 22 but few systemic weaknesses need to be addressed if the target is to be achieved. Of more concern is that less than 50 percent of apprentices engaged have completed training. There is a lack of information on the final outcome of gainful employment for the trainees. Only around 47,000 of the 2.21 lakh establishments have active programmes, indicating a need to generate employers' interest in apprenticeship. 108\n\nThe  apprenticeship  framework  thus  needs  to  be  re-calibrated  to  provide  flexibility  and negotiability in work hours, compensation, and disengagement, emulating the Swiss and German models of apprenticeships where students work as apprentices on weekends on mutually  agreeable  terms.  The  regulatory  framework  needs  to  be  mindful  of  the  costbenefit ratio of hiring apprentices for local firms. As it stands, apprentices' productivity and working hour may vary and flexibility in the contract terms could enable mutually beneficial arrangements rather than closing doors for any engagement. There is a need to minimise the role of Government agencies in order to address the delays in the programme and ease the compliance requirements of establishments. Establishing a mechanism to convert the skills acquired  at  apprenticeships  into  gainful  employment  by  networking  between  registered establishments and industry clusters, forward linkages with entrepreneurship schemes etc. would also be useful. Operationalising the matching of opportunities and demand at local levels such as a district or satellites areas of cities, etc., would improve outcomes.\n\n105    Muehlemann, S., Wolter, S.C.

This data will help estimate the number of apprentices that can be absorbed by industries and workplaces. In the long run, the focus should be on effective implementation by raising awareness, incentivising industries, and engaging key stakeholders. 109\n\nThe large share of the informal sector in employment is both a challenge and an opportunity. Interventions targeting skill development and upskilling in the informal sector can lead to an increase in productivity in these jobs and improve earnings for the cohort of unskilled and semi-skilled workforce. Strengthening and recalibrating the apprenticeship framework can be the means to make effective use of this opportunity.",
