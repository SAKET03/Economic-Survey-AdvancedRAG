The country envisions a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, with Net Zero carbon emissions by 2070 guiding its interventions for high and robust economic growth. India faces challenges in balancing development needs with a low-carbon pathway. The global approach to dealing with climate change is flawed as it ignores trade-offs. Developed nations have postponed their climate-related targets, such as the UK delaying the ban on petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030 to 2035. Germany diluted its rules for banning boilers running on fossil fuels. The rise of alternative political parties in developed nations is attributed to public resistance to climate-related rules. Climate change continues to dominate policy and discourses worldwide. India's energy needs are expected to grow 2 to 2.5 times by 2047. The country aims to add 30 GW of solar capacity and reduce 720 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. India has made significant progress on climate action, achieving 40% cumulative electrical power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in 2021. The country has updated its Nationally Determined Contribution, enhancing its targets. India submitted its Third National Communication and first Adaptation Communication to the UNFCCC in December 2023. The energy sector contributed the most to overall anthropogenic emissions at 75.81%. India's GDP grew at a CAGR of about 7% between 2005 and 2019, while emissions grew at a CAGR of about 4%. The country has successfully decoupled its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. India is on track to make an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes through tree and forest cover by 2030. The country has adopted the mission-mode approach to address climate change through the National Action Plan on Climate Change. India has made significant progress in renewable energy, with a cumulative solar power capacity of 82.64 GW as of April 2024. The Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme has resulted in significant energy savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. India aims to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030 from 2005 levels. The country has launched several initiatives to improve energy efficiency, including the Energy Conservation Building Code and the Standards and Labelling program. India's energy mix is expected to change significantly, with a share of non-fossil power capacity reaching 45.4% as of May 2024. The country aims to achieve Net Zero by 2070, requiring an orderly transition to a diversified mix of energy sources. India has launched initiatives such as PM-Surya Ghar Yojana to enhance renewable energy production. The country has also notified the national offshore wind energy policy and offshore wind energy lease rules. India's Green Hydrogen Mission targets 5 MMT of green hydrogen by 2030. The electrolysis and renewable energy used as inputs are major components of green hydrogen production cost. India faces challenges in energy transition, including intermittency and discontinuous supply of renewable energy. The country needs to develop energy storage systems, including battery storage. India has announced a viability gap funding scheme for offshore wind energy projects. The country aims to triple its global renewable energy capacity and accelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power. India has emphasized the importance of energy efficiency measures in accelerating clean energy transitions. The country has implemented several measures to improve energy efficiency, including the Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme and the Standards and Labelling program. India's carbon market will allow the determination of a price for one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The country has established the Indian Carbon Market to enable a per-output emissions limit. India aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve Net Zero by 2070. The country needs to enhance international cooperation in R&D, especially in domains such as distributed RE, offshore wind, and green hydrogen. India faces challenges in accessing affordable finance for its low-carbon development pathway. The country requires an estimated USD 2.5 trillion in investments to achieve its climate goals. India has taken several measures to improve the business environment and catalyze greater quantum of resources. The country has issued sovereign green bonds to raise proceeds for public sector projects. India's Mission LiFE aims to encourage the adoption of sustainable lifestyles to address climate change. The country supports voluntary environmental actions such as the Green Credit Programme. India has led several international initiatives towards climate change mitigation and building resilience. The country has established the International Solar Alliance to deploy solar energy solutions. India aims to interconnect solar energy systems on a massive scale through the One World, One Sun, One Grid initiative. The country has launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems. India aims to achieve its ambitious growth targets while reducing carbon emissions. The country faces the dual challenge of meeting energy demands while reducing carbon emissions. India's energy needs are expected to grow significantly, and the country needs to target a diversified set of energy sources.\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Present Status of India's Climate Action\n\n## PRESENT STATUS OF INDIA'S CLIMATE ACTION\n\n6.15. India has adopted the mission-mode approach to address climate change. The National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) 11   outlines the strategy to enhance the sustainability of the country's development path. Based on the principles of achieving high economic growth while  also  improving  the  ecological  sustainability  of  India's  developmental  path,  NAPCC includes nine national missions covering solar, water, energy efficiency, forests, sustainable habitat, sustainable agriculture, sustaining the Himalayan Ecosystem, strategic knowledge for climate change, and the recently added mission on human health. A broad spectrum of climate action - adaptation and mitigation, including demand side management - is being taken through the programme. States and Union Territories (UTs) have been encouraged to prepare their State Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) consistent with strategies in the NAPCC.  So far, 34 SAPCCs are operational, laying out sector-specific and cross-sectoral, time-bound priority actions for the state.\n\n6.16. India has made significant progress on climate action. The addition to the installed solar power capacity was 15.03 GW in 2023-24, reaching a cumulative of 82.64 GW on 30 April 2024. 12   Under the National Mission on Enhanced Energy Efficiency, the eighth cycle of the Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme 13  was notified in June 2023 for the period 202324 to 2025-26 and covers sectors like Aluminium, Cement, Chlor-Alkali, Iron &amp; Steel, Pulp &amp; Paper, and Textile with a total energy saving target of 0.3370 MTOE (million tonnes of oil equivalent). The PAT scheme in its various cycles has resulted in a significant amount of energy savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Box 2).\n\n6.17. As a result of the coordinated action, most targets of the first NDC were achieved well in advance. For instance, the country achieved 40 per cent cumulative electrical power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in 2021 and reduced the emission intensity of  India's  GDP  from 2005 levels by 33 per cent in 2019- nine and eleven years before the target year of 2030, respectively. The NDC was further updated in August 2022. 14   The target to reduce the emissions intensity of India's GDP was enhanced to 45 per cent (from the earlier 3335 per cent) by 2030 from the 2005 level, and the target on cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources increased to 50 per cent (earlier 40 per cent) by 2030. As of 31 May 2024, the share of non-fossil sources in the installed electricity\n\n11  National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), Frequently Asked Question, December 01, 2021, PIB,  https:// static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2021/dec/doc202112101.pdf.\n\n12   Year-wise Achievements, M/o New and Renewable Energy, https://mnre.gov.in/year-wise-achievement/.\n\n13   Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) is a regulatory instrument to reduce Specific Energy Consumption in energyintensive  industries,  with  an  associated  market-based  mechanism  to  enhance  the  cost-effectiveness  through certification of excess energy saving which can be traded. Currently, the eighth cycle of this scheme is under operation, https://beeindia.gov.in/en/perform-achieve-and-trade-pat-0.\n\n14   India's Updated First Nationally Determined Contribution Under Paris Agreement (2021-2030), (August 2022), Submission  to  UNFCCC,https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/NDC/2022-08/India%20Updated%20First%20 Nationally%20Determined%20Contrib.pdf.\n\ngeneration capacity has reached 45.4 per cent. 15  India is on track to make an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes through tree and forest cover by 2030, with a carbon sink of 1.97 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent having already been created from 2005 to 2019.\n\n6.18. Parties  to  the  United  Nations  Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC) must periodically submit National Communication (NC) with information on their greenhouse gas  emissions,  their  vulnerability  to  climate  change,  and  the  measures  they  are  taking  to mitigate  emissions  and  adapt  to  the  impacts  of  climate  change.  India  submitted  its  Third National Communication (TNC), 16  including India's first Adaptation Communication (AC), 17 to the UNFCCC in December 2023. India's TNC mentions that the energy sector contributed the most to the overall anthropogenic emissions at 75.81 per cent, followed by the agriculture sector at 13.44 per cent, Industrial Process &amp; Product Use (IPPU) at 8.41 per cent, and waste at 2.34 per cent. It also mentions that the Land Use, Land-Use Change &amp; Forestry (LULUCF) sector remained a net sink in 2019, accounting for removing 4,85,472 GgCO2e 18   emissions. Considering total emissions and removals, India's net national emissions in 2019 were 26,46,556 GgCO2e.\n\n6.19. The plethora of cross-sectoral measures taken in the economy and the several schemes to  modify  consumer  and  producer  behaviour  and  promote  energy  saving  have  resulted  in India's total national emissions (including LULUCF) increasing by 4.56 per cent since 2016, which compares favourably with the growth experienced by the country. Interestingly, India's GDP between 2005 and 2019 has grown with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of about seven per cent, whereas the emissions grew at a CAGR of about four per cent. i.e., the rate of emissions growth is lower than the rate of growth of our GDP. This shows that India has  successfully  decoupled  its  economic  growth  from  greenhouse  gas  emissions,  reducing the emission intensity of its GDP. A recent report by the International Finance Corporation recognises India's efforts to achieve committed climate actions, highlighting that it is the only G20 nation in line with 2-degree centigrade warming. 19  Notably, these outcomes have been achieved primarily through domestic resources, 20  which have predominantly formed the basis of India's climate action. Given the financing needs, estimated at USD 2.5 trillion (at 2014-15 prices) for meeting the NDC targets till 2030, access to finance and technology at a reasonable cost,  including  from  the  developed  countries,  as  mandated  by    the  UNFCCC  and  its  Paris Agreement, is essential to ease the constraint on the required resources.",
