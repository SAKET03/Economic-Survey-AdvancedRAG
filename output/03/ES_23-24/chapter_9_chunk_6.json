The sector provides livelihood support to about 42.3% of the population and contributes 18.2% to the country's GDP. In 2023-24, the growth rate of the agriculture sector stood at 1.4%, which is below 4.7% in 2022-23, mainly due to a drop in foodgrain production caused by delayed and poor monsoons.\\n\\nThe country has a comfortable stock of foodgrains, with around 40% distributed to two-thirds of the population free of cost. India exports more than 7% of its food grains. However, the sector faces challenges such as low productivity levels, impact of variability in weather, fragmented land holdings, and inadequate marketing infrastructure.\\n\\nThe government has implemented various initiatives to improve productivity, including the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme, income support through Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PMKISAN), and promotion of sustainable practices through organic and natural farming. The digitalisation initiatives in Agriculture are expected to empower farmers through better decision-making tools.\\n\\nThe livestock and fisheries sectors have performed better than traditional crops, with an increase in their share in agriculture Gross Value Added (GVA) from 24.38% and 4.44% in 2014-15 to 30.23% and 7.25% in 2022-23, respectively. The fisheries sector has received support through programs like the Fisheries Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) and Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY).\\n\\nThe government has also promoted crop diversification, with a focus on pulses, oilseeds, and nutri-cereals. The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) have been implemented to enhance production and productivity of foodgrain and commercial crops.\\n\\nThe Gross Capital Formation (GCF) of the agriculture sector has grown steadily, with a rate of 19.04% in 2022-23. However, there is a need to further boost agriculture investment, especially in the context of doubling farmers' income. The average annual growth in GCF from 2016-17 to 2022-23 was 9.70%.\\n\\nThe Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has streamlined agricultural credit accessibility, with 7.5 crores KCC issued with a limit of ₹9.4 lakh crores. The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) provides a safety net against crop losses, with 5549.40 Lakh farmer applications insured under the scheme since 2016-17.\\n\\nThe e-NAM Scheme has been implemented to promote efficiency in agriculture marketing and improve price discovery. As of March 2024, more than 1.77 crore farmers and 2.56 lakh traders have been registered on the e-NAM portal.\\n\\nThe government has also taken initiatives to promote investment in agriculture and allied sectors, including the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme and the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF). The AIF provides medium-term debt financing for post-harvest management and community farming projects, with an investment of ₹73194 Crore mobilized as of July 2024.\\n\\nThe Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY) provides credit-linked financial assistance through grants-in-aid to build efficient supply chain management from farm to retail. The scheme has been approved for 1044 projects till March 2024, with a total project cost of ₹32.78 Thousand Crore and approved subsidy of ₹9.3 Thousand Crore.\\n\\nThe National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture aims to make Indian agriculture more resilient to climate change. The government has also promoted organic and natural farming, with 68.05 lakh hectares brought under organic farming by 2022-23.\\n\\nThe Indian Council on Agricultural Research (ICAR) is the apex organization in agriculture research, with 347 varieties/hybrids of 44 crops released and 99 varieties of horticultural crops notified for commercial cultivation in 2022-23. The food processing industry in India is one of the largest employers in organized manufacturing, with a 12.02% share in total employment.\\n\\nThe Production Linked Incentive Scheme for the Food Processing Industry supports the creation of global food manufacturing champions. The PM Formalization of Micro Food Processing Enterprises scheme provides credit-linked subsidy and capacity building, including marketing and branding support, with 3,53,608 applications received and a loan amount of ₹6.94 Thousand Crore sanctioned.\\n\\nThe government has also taken initiatives to improve food management, including procurement of foodgrains at MSP and distribution of foodgrains at less than economic cost. The economic cost of rice and wheat witnessed a significant increase during the last few years, with the economic cost of rice and wheat for 2023-24 (RE) at ₹3931.34 per quintal and ₹2709.59 per quintal, respectively.\\n\\nThe performance of the agriculture sector remains critical for the economy's growth, with an average growth rate of 4.18% over the last five years.

Promoting crop diversification, investment in agri-infrastructure, credit accessibility, and market institutions are crucial for sustainable agriculture practices and improving farm income.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Conclusion\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n9.48  The performance of the agriculture sector remains critical for the economy's growth and has been growing at an average growth rate of 4.18 per cent over the last five years. The growing significance of allied sectors such as animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries in enhancing farmers' income suggests that greater emphasis should be placed on tapping into the potential of these activities to boost farmers' incomes. Smallholder farmers' incomes cannot be increased by producing rice, wheat, or even millets, pulses and oilseeds. They need to move to high-value agriculture - fruits and vegetables, fisheries, poultry, dairy and buffalo meat. Once the incomes of  smallholders  increase,  they  will  demand  manufactured  goods,  spurring  a  manufacturing revolution. That is what happened in China between 1978 and 1984 when the real incomes of farmers doubled in just 6 years. India is well-placed to emulate this.\n\n9.49  Promoting  crop  diversification  towards  oilseeds,  pulses,  and  horticulture  requires addressing  critical  issues  such  as  investment  in  agri-infrastructure,  credit  accessibility  and appropriate market institutions. MSP has incentivised crop diversification and there is evidence that MSP has a positive and statistically significant effect on retail prices of all crops, with a stronger effect for those crops where procurement is substantial, such as paddy and wheat. 49\n\n49 https://rbidocs.rbi.org.in/rdocs/AnnualReport/PDFs/0ANREPORT201718077745EC9A874DB38C991F580ED14242.PDF\n\nEfforts must be made to encourage production patterns and practices in various geographies that are consistent with their agro-climatic characteristics and natural resources. Research and development and promotion of digital technologies in agriculture, as well as improving the quality of seeds, including promoting organic and natural farming, can play a significant role in the realisation of sustainable agriculture practices that efficiently improve farm income and influence farmer behaviour.\n\n9.50    Enhancing  private  sector  investment  in  agriculture  is  vital  to  provide  impetus  to  the agriculture sector. Investment in technology, production methods, marketing infrastructure, and reduction in  post-harvest  losses  need  to  be  scaled  up.  A  greater  focus  on  post-harvest infrastructure and the development of the food processing sector can reduce wastage/loss and increase the length of storage, ensuring better prices for the farmers. Productivity of the crop sector can also be enhanced through greater investment, including from the private sector.\n\n9.51  E-NAM,  promoting  FPOs,  and  allowing  cooperatives  to  participate  in  agri-marketing can improve the market infrastructure and allow better price discovery. Improving the market infrastructure by incentivising states can be explored. This can be done by creating an index to rank states, allowing the participation of cooperatives, and enabling remunerative returns to investors according to the functioning of their APMCs and other market institutions. Such a competitive framework can drive states to strive for improved agricultural marketing. It is also worth considering providing financial incentives for states to undertake necessary interventions to modernise agriculture marketing as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission.\n\n********",
