The sector provides livelihood support to about 42.3% of the population and contributes 18.2% to the country's GDP. In 2023-24, the growth rate of the agriculture sector stood at 1.4%, which is below 4.7% in 2022-23, mainly due to a drop in foodgrain production caused by delayed and poor monsoons.\\n\\nThe country has a comfortable stock of foodgrains, with around 40% distributed to two-thirds of the population free of cost. India exports more than 7% of its food grains. However, the sector faces challenges such as low productivity levels, impact of variability in weather, fragmented land holdings, and inadequate marketing infrastructure.\\n\\nThe government has implemented various initiatives to improve productivity, including the Minimum Support Price (MSP) scheme, income support through Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PMKISAN), and promotion of sustainable practices through organic and natural farming. The digitalisation initiatives in Agriculture are expected to empower farmers through better decision-making tools.\\n\\nThe livestock and fisheries sectors have performed better than traditional crops, with an increase in their share in agriculture Gross Value Added (GVA) from 24.38% and 4.44% in 2014-15 to 30.23% and 7.25% in 2022-23, respectively. The fisheries sector has received support through programs like the Fisheries Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) and Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY).\\n\\nThe government has also promoted crop diversification, with a focus on pulses, oilseeds, and nutri-cereals. The National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and Crop Diversification Programme (CDP) have been implemented to enhance production and productivity of foodgrain and commercial crops.\\n\\nThe Gross Capital Formation (GCF) of the agriculture sector has grown steadily, with a rate of 19.04% in 2022-23. However, there is a need to further boost agriculture investment, especially in the context of doubling farmers' income. The average annual growth in GCF from 2016-17 to 2022-23 was 9.70%.\\n\\nThe Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has streamlined agricultural credit accessibility, with 7.5 crores KCC issued with a limit of ₹9.4 lakh crores. The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) provides a safety net against crop losses, with 5549.40 Lakh farmer applications insured under the scheme since 2016-17.\\n\\nThe e-NAM Scheme has been implemented to promote efficiency in agriculture marketing and improve price discovery. As of March 2024, more than 1.77 crore farmers and 2.56 lakh traders have been registered on the e-NAM portal.\\n\\nThe government has also taken initiatives to promote investment in agriculture and allied sectors, including the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme and the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF). The AIF provides medium-term debt financing for post-harvest management and community farming projects, with an investment of ₹73194 Crore mobilized as of July 2024.\\n\\nThe Pradhan Mantri Kisan SAMPADA Yojana (PMKSY) provides credit-linked financial assistance through grants-in-aid to build efficient supply chain management from farm to retail. The scheme has been approved for 1044 projects till March 2024, with a total project cost of ₹32.78 Thousand Crore and approved subsidy of ₹9.3 Thousand Crore.\\n\\nThe National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture aims to make Indian agriculture more resilient to climate change. The government has also promoted organic and natural farming, with 68.05 lakh hectares brought under organic farming by 2022-23.\\n\\nThe Indian Council on Agricultural Research (ICAR) is the apex organization in agriculture research, with 347 varieties/hybrids of 44 crops released and 99 varieties of horticultural crops notified for commercial cultivation in 2022-23. The food processing industry in India is one of the largest employers in organized manufacturing, with a 12.02% share in total employment.\\n\\nThe Production Linked Incentive Scheme for the Food Processing Industry supports the creation of global food manufacturing champions. The PM Formalization of Micro Food Processing Enterprises scheme provides credit-linked subsidy and capacity building, including marketing and branding support, with 3,53,608 applications received and a loan amount of ₹6.94 Thousand Crore sanctioned.\\n\\nThe government has also taken initiatives to improve food management, including procurement of foodgrains at MSP and distribution of foodgrains at less than economic cost. The economic cost of rice and wheat witnessed a significant increase during the last few years, with the economic cost of rice and wheat for 2023-24 (RE) at ₹3931.34 per quintal and ₹2709.59 per quintal, respectively.\\n\\nThe performance of the agriculture sector remains critical for the economy's growth, with an average growth rate of 4.18% over the last five years. The sector's growth is expected to be driven by high-value agriculture, including fruits and vegetables, fisheries, poultry, dairy, and buffalo meat. Promoting crop diversification, investment in agri-infrastructure, credit accessibility, and market institutions are crucial for sustainable agriculture practices and improving farm income.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n9.1 The Indian agriculture sector provides livelihood support to about 42.3 per cent of the population and has a share of 18.2 per cent in the country's GDP 3  at current prices. The sector has  been  buoyant,  which  is  evident  from  the  fact  that  it  has  registered  an  average  annual growth rate of 4.18 4 per cent at constant prices over the last five years. Several initiatives and measures taken by the government in the form of assured remunerative prices through MSP improving access to institutional credit, enabling crop diversification, promoting digitisation, and mechanisation, encouraging adoption of sustainable practices through organic and natural farming, and focusing on productivity enhancement have had a positive impact on the sector. As per provisional estimates for 2023-24, the growth rate of the agriculture sector stood at 1.4\n\n1 Chand, R., Joshi, P., &amp; Khadka, S. (2022).

The allied activities - livestock and fisheries have performed better than the traditional crops such as cereals 7 , which is evident from an increase in their share in agriculture Gross Value Added (GVA) at current prices from 24.38 per cent and 4.44 per cent in 2014-15 to 30.23 per cent and 7.25 per cent in 2022-23 8 respectively. The share of the crops sector in Agriculture GVA at current prices in 2022-23 9  was 55.28 per cent as compared to 61.75 per cent in 2014-15.\n\n9.2 While the country is a major agriculture producer, being the second largest producer in rice, wheat, cotton, among other crops, and the largest producer of milk, pulses and spices 10 , the crop yields in the country are much lower than the other major producers (Fig IX.2). That this is so despite the fact that the bulk of the government support goes to rice and wheat if a cause for reflection. Fragmented land holdings, low farm investment, lack of farm mechanisation, insufficient access to quality inputs, and inadequate marketing infrastructure leading to postharvest losses, dependency on rains and short growing seasons are a few reasons for the low yields.\n\nSource: National Statistical Office (NSO) M/o Statistics &amp; PI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.3 Several  interventions  are  being  undertaken  to  improve  productivity  in  agriculture  in line with the recommendations of the Doubling Farmers Income Report (DFI) 2016, which identified strategies to increase crop and livestock productivity, enchancing cropping intensity, diversify to high-value agriculture and provide remunerative prices on farmers' produce.

Other interventions  include  income  support  through  Pradhan  Mantri  Kisan  Samman  Nidhi  (PMKISAN), which gives the farmer a direct financial benefit of ₹6000/- per year. Promotion of greater efficiency in the use of inputs and sustainable production methods through Per Drop More Crop (PDMC), a micro irrigation scheme and the actions under the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA), including the use of alternative and organic fertilisers are a few examples on other initiatives being undertaken to improve productivity and sustainability. In addition, digital initiatives such as the Digital Agriculture Mission and e-National Agriculture Market  (e-NAM)  have  also  been  taken  up  to  facilitate  the  adoption  of  smart  agriculture technologies, with the latter allowing better price discovery.\n\n9.4 The roles, animal husbandry and fisheries play in improving farmers' income, especially when agriculture holdings are reduced, is duly recognised.  The scheme such as the Rashtriya Gokul Mission(RGM), National Digital Livestock Mission 4  (NDLM), and National Programme for Dairy Development (NPDD) include interventions to improve quality, enable access to the organised markets and the development of indigenous breeds. The fisheries sector has been supported through programmes for improving productivity, access to institutional credit, and infrastructure development through the Fisheries Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) with a total fund size of ₹7.52 Thousand Crore. Similarly, Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana  (PMMSY)  introduced  in  May  2020  aimed  at  strengthening  fisheries  infrastructure, enable technology infusion and promote optimal water management. These interventions in fisheries sector have resulted in increasing fish production by an average annual growth of 7.4 per cent in 2022-23 from 2020-21 11 .\n\n11 Department of Fisheries",
