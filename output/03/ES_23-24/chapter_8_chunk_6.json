The current workforce in 2022-23 56 has been estimated using the WPR (usual status, all ages) for 2022-23 from PLFS and the corresponding population estimates by MoHFW. 57  The rise in workforce has been estimated assuming constant WPR for men (54.4 per cent in 2023) and rising WPR for women (from 27.0 per cent in 2023 to 40.0 per cent in 2036, increasing by 1 percentage point every year). 58 Further, to account for the structural transformation, it is assumed that the share of agriculture in workforce gradually declines from 45.8 per cent in 2023 59  to one-fourth in 2047, 60  and the corresponding workforce thereby leaving agriculture is added to the rise in workforce. This is a reasonable assumption to make given the sticky predominance of agriculture in employment, and  the  potential  of  high-value  agriculture  and  allied  activities  to  generate  remunerative employment,  especially  for  women.  Consequently,  Indian  economy  needs  to  generate  an average of nearly 78.5 lakh jobs annually until 2030 in the non-farm sector to cater to the rising workforce (see Chart VIII.24 below).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Calculated using PLFS, MoHFW population estimates.\n\n56  2022-23 is referred to as 2023 in the section.\n\n57    Population estimates as of 1st March have been converted to estimates as of 1st January using linear method, since January is the middle point of the July-June timeframe used by PLFS.\n\n58  At this rate, the female WPR will reach 51 per cent by 2047.\n\n59  Source: PLFS 2022-23 annual report\n\n60  This implies an yearly decline of 0.87 percentage points.\n\n8.46  To  meet  the  demand  of  78.5  lakh  jobs  in  non-farm  sector  per  year,  there  is  scope  to supplement  the  existing  schemes  of  PLI  (60  lakh  employment  generation  over  5  years), 61 MITRA  Textile  scheme  (20  lakh  employment  generation), 62   MUDRA,  etc.,  while  boosting their implementation. In the following sections, two sectors for further job creation have been identified and elaborated upon. Over and above the quantity of employment, its quality and social security aspect has its own significance. The rising employment of flexi workers through staffing companies can be a channel for ensuring social security for informal workers, as briefed in Box VIII.4.\n\n## Box VIII.4: Flexi job market in India\n\nThere are nearly 5.4 million formal contract staff or flexi workers in India employed through organised contract/temporary staffing companies. These staffing companies are responsible for  the  timely  payout  of  salaries/wages,  social  security/medical  insurance  towards  their contract staff. Although they work on a contract, these workers are fully protected with social security, and the average length of contract has been rising with more than 75 per cent of the contracts in 2023 for over six months. The flexi workforce has grown at a CAGR of 13.2 per cent in the decade ending 2023, and remained positive even during the COVID pandemic. However, as a share of the total workforce, the contract staffing workforce is about 1 per cent only, compared to 2.2 per cent in Europe and Asia Pacific. The low percentage of flexi jobs in India indicates that the corporate sector has not replaced full-time workers with flexi workers.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 61  PIB release dated 05 Feb 2024 https://tinyurl.com/jr5e4m4v\n- 62  PIB release dated 21 Dec 2023 https://tinyurl.com/desnm7um\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n80\tper\tcent\tof\tthe\tflexi\tworkers\tare\tin\tthe\t21-30\tage\tgroup,\twith\tan\taverage\tsalary\tof\tâ‚¹\t20,00022,000 a month. Most contract/flexi jobs in India continue to happen at the lower end of the skill spectrum such as data operations, accounts, sales, back-end operations, administration and marketing. Nearly 60 per cent of the flexi jobs are in logistics, infrastructure/construction &amp; energy, BFSI, IT and IT Enabled Services.\n\n## AGRO-PROCESSING AS A PROMISING SECTOR FOR RURAL EMPLOYMENT AND GROWTH\n\n8.47  The  agro-processing  sector  lies  at  the  intersection  of  multiple  opportunities  for  rural growth besides being an intermediate sector for the 'farm to factory' transition. The following paras elaborate on the suitability of agro-processing for job creation, given India's stage of development.\n\n8.48 Demand for rural jobs: MGNREGS data shows substantial demand for low-skill rural jobs (especially by women, who constitute more than half of MGNREGS workforce), and there remains  ample  scope  for  shifting  MGNREGS  labour  to  more  productive  and  less  fiscallystraining  ventures.  Given  that  agriculture  and  related  industries  remain  the  mainstay  of the rural economy, increasing productivity in this sector is imperative to create jobs. Agroprocessing can also accelerate crop diversification in areas such as Punjab and Haryana, where paddy cultivation faces serious challenges related to groundwater scarcity.\n\n8.49 Low value-addition in agriculture: While India is endowed with 11.2 per cent of total arable land in the world and is ranked first in the production of milk, pulses, and jute, second in fruits and vegetables and third in cereals 63, value addition in agriculture continues to be low.\n\n63    Annual Report, MoFPI, 2021-22\n\nAs per a study conducted on the Level of Food Processing in India (Deloitte, 2020-21) 64 , the processing level in India is at 4.5 per cent for fruits, 2.7 per cent for vegetables, 21.1 per cent for milk, 34.2 per cent for meat and 15.4 per cent for fishery. In contrast, 30 per cent of food in China is processed as against 60-80 per cent in Western countries (Liu et al. 2007). 65\n\n8.50 Rising demand for diverse and local food products: A better connection of farmers with food processing units could bring a more extensive and diverse pool of agricultural products to the market, the demand for which has been rising with affluence and diet-consciousness in India and abroad. As per a report by InvestIndia 66 , the Indian food processing market is estimated to reach USD535 billion by 2025, growing at a CAGR of 15.2 per cent. Tier-2 and Tier3 cities could mirror the trend visible in metropolitan areas by consuming more processed food in the coming years. Further, the share of processed food exports in agri-exports has increased substantially from 13.7 per cent in FY15 to 25.6 per cent in FY23.\n\n8.51 Presence of precedents: There are many success stories to emulate a bottom-up approach to agro-processing, such as the Sahyadri Farmer Producer Company in Maharashtra (refer to Box VIII.5), Araku Coffee plantations by tribals in Andhra Pradesh, Mahagrapes in Maharashtra supported by Mahindra Agro, and Synthites spice-processing group in Kerala.\n\n## Box VIII.5: Sahyadri's Success in Agro-processing\n\nSahyadri  Farmer  Producer  Company  (SFPC),  an  agro-processing  unit  based  in  Nashik, Maharashtra,  has  emerged  as  a  beacon  of  agricultural  innovation  and  socio-economic development  in  the  region.  Boasting  more  than  12  years  of  experience  in  the  industry, Sahyadri\tcrossed\ta\tremarkable\tturnover\tof\tâ‚¹1000\tcrore\tin\tFY23. 67 . The impressive growth trajectory is attributed to a farmer-centric approach accompanied by a robust supply chain, efficient technology, and world-class infrastructure.\n\nThe exponential growth in Sahyadri Farms has led to the creation of 1300 full-time jobs and  an  additional  4000  seasonal  jobs 68 ,  thus  contributing  to  the  region's  employment opportunities.  With  infrastructure  spanning  over  31,000  acres  of  land,  SFPC  holds  the status of being India's largest exporter of fresh grapes and processed fruits such as tomatoes, mangoes, sweet corn, and cashew nuts.\n\nThe heart of SPFC's ethics lies in its unwavering support for small-scale farmers, with over 95 per cent of associated farmers owning less than one hectare of land. 69 . This not only fosters sustainable agricultural practices but also fuels the rural economy by boosting income levels within local communities.\n\n64  https://tinyurl.com/4fmx4kjs\n\n65    Liu, E., Taylor, D., &amp; Zhang, S.

Additionally, Sahyadri has projected that this initiative will facilitate employment for over 300 women in the area, thereby contributing to the social and economic development of the region. 71\n\n8.52 Avenues for captive demand of agro-processed output: The local units can supply the Aanganwadis, mid-day meal in schools, while agglomerations can supply urban consumers with rising health consciousness and 'vocal for local' sentiment. Specialised products could be linked to export supply chains, and a national portal listing all such products could be linked to e-commerce entities.\n\n8.53 Convergence of multiple existing programmes: The sector can benefit from utilising the synergies between Mega Food Park, Skill India, Mudra, one district-one product, etc., for labour, logistics, credit, and marketing. Such convergence of efforts would immensely benefit from a whole-of-government approach involving gram panchayat, block, and district administration. Organisations such as NABARD, Central Warehouse Corporation, Krishi Vigyan Kendra, etc., could  be  roped  in  for  prompt  handholding  and  troubleshooting,  given  their  expertise  and infrastructure in place. Women's self-help groups could be the foot soldiers in devising and implementing block- or panchayat-level plans, given their credibility, good repayment record, and rising relevance to women in farming.\n\n8.54  Thus, India, being an agriculturally gifted country, can utilise the range of products on offer by its different agro-climatic zones and productively engage the sizeable rural workforce, comprising women who seek remunerative part-time employment and educated youth who can be technically skilled to handle small to medium scale agro-processing units.\n\n## CARING OUR WAY TO GROWTH: THE NECESSITY AND PROSPECTS OF A WELL-DEVELOPED CARE ECONOMY IN INDIA\n\n8.55  The care economy is hitherto less known yet potentially significant for economic growth and well-being, especially for a young country like India, which has both demographic and gender dividends to reap. The interconnected dynamics of bolstering a care economy holds the promise of gender equity, human development, and economic growth. Developing a quality and reliable care sector can thus fill a critical efficiency gap in facilitating the best allocation of  human  resources,  driven  by  comparative  advantage  and  choice  rather  than  dictated  by gender. This sub-section explores the contours of the long-term benefits of prioritising care and proposes a few solutions to further develop this sector.\n\n70    https://agrospectrumindia.com/2023/08/20/nashik-based-fpc-sahyadri-farms-kicks-off-the-biggest-cashewprocessing-plant.html\n\n71 Bhosale,\tJ.,\t18\tAugust\t2023,\tEconomic\tTimes,\t'Leading\tgrape\texporter\tSahyadri\tFPO\tenters\tcashew\tprocessing sector', https://tinyurl.com/wd344p4x\n\n## Defining care work - the first step to acknowledging care as 'work'\n\n8.56  According to the ILO, care work consists of activities and relations involved in meeting the physical, psychological, and emotional needs of adults and children, old and young, frail and able-bodied. Care work falls into two categories: compensated and unpaid/underpaid. Unpaid or underpaid work related to caregiving and providing social support is often performed within households by females and usually consists of childcare, eldercare, domestic work, etc. Paid care work involves labour performed by nurses, caregivers, etc., for remuneration.\n\n## Increasing need for a well-developed care economy\n\n## Demographic transition - need to prepare for future care requirements of an ageing population\n\n8.57  India's care needs are slated to expand significantly in the next 25 years, as an ageing population follows the ongoing demographic transition while the population of children stays relatively sizeable. According to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) 72 as of 2022, one-fourth of India's population is aged 0-14 years (i.e., 36 crore persons), while one-tenth is above 60 years (i.e., 14.7 crore persons). By 2050, the share of children is estimated to decline to 18 per cent (i.e., 30 crore persons), while the proportion of elderly persons would rise to 20.8 per cent (i.e., 34.7 crore persons). Thus, compared to 50.7 crore persons in 2022, the country would need to care for 64.7 crore persons in 2050. The additional requirements for care would be further upscaled as more women participate in paid work, the rising prevalence of nuclear families 73 , etc.\n\n## Equal opportunity for females - decoupling gender and unpaid care work\n\n8.58  Developing  an  appropriate  care  economy  is  crucial  when  viewed  through  the  lens  of fairness and efficiency of increasing the FLFPR by affording equal opportunity to participate in paid work. This is especially important given the predominant burden of unpaid care work, including\tdomestic\twork,\tchildcare,\tand\telderly\tcare,\tfalling\ton\twomen,\twho\tare\tthen\ttoo\t'timepoor' to participate fully in employment opportunities. This is a global phenomenon, which holds for India as well. The disproportionate burden of care on women is consequential to the low FLFPR across the world, including India. 74  According to Sinha et al. (2024), an additional hour  of  caregiving  per  day  reduces  women's  labour  market  participation  by  20  percentage points, with no effect on men. 75\n\n72 International\t Institute\t for\t Population\t Sciences\t and\t United\t Nations\t Population\t Fund,\t 'India\t Ageing\t Report 2023', https://india.unfpa.org/sites/default/files/pub-pdf/20230926\\_india\\_ageing\\_report\\_2023\\_web\\_ version\\_.pdf\n\n73    The share of nuclear families has been estimated to have increased from 37 per cent of total households in 2008 to 50 per cent of total households in 2022, according to data from a consumer survey company Kantar.\n\n74    United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP). (2022). Female Labour Force Participation and Care. Economy in Asia and the Pacific.\n\n75    Sinha, A.; Sedai, AK; Rahut, DB, Sonobe, T. (2024). Well-being costs of unpaid care: Gendered evidence from a contextualized time-use survey in India. World Development, 173, ISSN 0305-750X, https://doi.org/10.1016/j. worlddev.2023.106419.\n\n8.59  According to the NSO's Time Use Statistics for 2019, working-age women in India spend 5.6 hours per day on unpaid work, compared to only 30 minutes per day by men. Even women in  paid  employment  spend  nearly  6X  time  on  unpaid  care  work  compared  to  men  in  paid employment, culminating in the 'double burden' of performing both paid work and unpaid care responsibilities. This care burden-induced professional inequality is in contrast with the rising equality of opportunity in education, with the closing of the gender gap in higher education enrolment in India.\n\n8.60  Specifically, the impact of childbearing and childcare is found to have a significant cost on women's careers, termed the 'motherhood penalty', depicted as a drop in FLFPR around childbearing years and a loss of income. Regarding the quality of employment, the motherhood penalty manifests in women tending to be concentrated in farming and informal jobs, as those workspaces  are  compatible  with  their  personal  care  responsibilities  (Palriwala  and  Neetha (2012)). 76  Even though the time spent on unpaid care work per day is only 9 minutes higher for rural women vis-Ã -vis urban women, higher rural FLFPR could be explained by the flexibility, in terms of timing and proximity of employment, which allows child supervision, that rural jobs typically provide (Gautham 2022). 77\n\n## Economic potential - generating value by making the best use of human capital\n\n8.61  This unpaid/invisible domestic work performed by women, which is usually neglected while calculating the labour force and the GDP, has been variously estimated as highly valuable yet invisible. A recent report by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) uses a standardised input-value method to estimate the economic value of women's unpaid domestic and care work in India as 15 - 17 per cent of GDP. 78\n\n8.62  The economic value of developing a care sector is twofold - increasing FLFPR (discussed previously) and promoting a promising sector for output and job creation. According to ILO (2018), the care sector is one of the fastest-growing sectors globally, and investments in the care services sector are estimated to generate 475 million jobs globally by 2030. In the case of India, direct public investment equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP has the potential to generate 11 million jobs, nearly 70 per cent of which will go to women. 79\n\n## Multidimensional impact of creches - Empirical evidence\n\n8.63  A wide range of research has emphasised the impact of affordable and reliable childcare on freeing women's time for paid employment, enhancing mental health and improving children's learning and nutrition. That said, the literature is mainly foreign and empirical studies on India are scarce.\n\n76    Palriwala, R. and Neetha, N. 2012.

First, low-income mothers received assistance in finding paid employment. Second, the initiative created some 45,000 paid positions for caregivers and their assistants - the majority of whom were women (OECD 2012) 80 .\n\n8.65  In  Brazil,  children  aged  0-3  who  live  in  low-income  neighbourhoods  could  access integrated social, health, and educational services through the Rio de Janeiro Public Day Care programme. According to Barros et al. (2011), the programme had significant impact on female economic opportunities as mothers' employment increased by 27 per cent, and a very high utilisation rate resulted from having access to the programme. 81  While India-specific research on the impact of access to childcare is very limited, some of the studies that examined the situation in India are presented below.\n\n8.66  According to a qualitative study by Mobile Creches NGO in 4 states (Gujarat, Jharkhand, Odisha, Karnataka) 82  carried out in December 2021- February 2022, 61 per cent of employed women  availing  creches  relied  on  NGOs,  while  the  share  of  government-run  creches  was relatively small (21 per cent). The employed women not availing creches relied mainly on adult family members (41 per cent) and elder daughters (11 per cent). The study found a positive impact  of  quality  creche  facilities  on  women's  well-being,  income,  child  well-being,  and relationships with family members.\n\n80    OECD. 2012.

Creches  helped  reduce malnutrition, decrease stress, and increase the self-reported happiness of mothers (Nandi et al.) 84\n\n## Government Programme: Revamped Palna scheme for creches\n\n8.69  The Anganwadi-Cum-CrÃ¨che initiative under the Palna Scheme of the Ministry of Women and Child Development underwent revisions and was included in the Mission Shakti in April 2022. The scheme aims to address the gap that exists mainly in urban areas where support for childcare from family members is not available, and there is a need for institutional support to facilitate the contribution of women to the economy. The Government aims to establish 17,000 Anganwadi-cum-CrÃ¨ches under the scheme, of which 5222 have been approved as of December 2023. 85  The scheme can significantly benefit from broader coverage in rural and urban areas.\n\n## Senior care reforms in India: Reimagining the senior care paradigm\n\n8.70  As India strives to become a developed economy by 2047, it will also get older. According to the Asian Development Bank's (ADB) 'Ageing Well in Asia' report, 86  The old-age dependency ratio is expected to rise from less than 20 per cent in 2022 to over 30 per cent by 2050. The care responsibility associated with an increasingly older population necessitates initiating early dialogues around senior care to develop a future-ready elderly care policy.\n\n## The rising need for elderly care\n\n8.71  The India Ageing Report 2023 87  by UNFPA and the International Institute for Population Sciences highlights that a significant portion of the elderly population suffers from chronic diseases, functional limitations, depressive symptoms, and low life satisfaction. As the elderly population is increasingly female and residing in rural areas, feminisation and ruralisation of the elderly are linked with poverty, dependency, and loneliness. The recommendations of the report are as follows.\n\n- Including\trelevant\tquestions\tin\tthe\tNational\tSample\tSurvey,\tthe\tNational\tFamily\tHealth Survey, and the Census of India to inform evidence-based policymaking.\n\n83    Association  for  Stimulating  Know  How  (2011),  'SEWA  Childcare:  Impact  Assessment Report for Year 2011'.

India, therefore, needs a structured elderly care policy framework.\n\n8.73  According to the ADB report 89 , the working capacity of older people is a sizeable economic resource. Utilising this 'silver dividend' of untapped work capacity of population aged 60-69 years is  estimated  to  increase  GDP  by  an  average  of  1.5  per  cent  for  Asian  economies.  The report advocates for age-friendly jobs with a gradual work-to-retirement path encompassing lifelong learning and skill development. From the care perspective, suitable job roles for older population can offer social engagement, financial security, besides reducing the overall care requirement. Box VIII.6 presents some suggestions on building a care economy ecosystem in the country.\n\n## Box VIII.6: Building a better care ecosystem\n\nStrategic reforms are required to build a solid structure of the care economy. The reforms could  be  along  the  following  lines:  (i)  support  for  parental  leave  policies;  (ii)  subsidies for care services; (iii) public and private investments in building care infrastructure; (iv) mechanisms for skill training for care workers; and (v) mechanisms for monitoring service quality  and  benchmarks;  offers  a  comprehensive  framework  for  addressing  the  gender disparities  in  care  and  domestic  work  and  boosting  women's  labour  force  participation. Some specific policy interventions could be:\n\n- Sector\tSkill\tCouncil\tfor\tCare\tServices\tcan\tbe\tset\tup to help develop a skill training framework for the care sector, formulate skilling modules, and undertake partnerships with international skill training institutes. There is a need for a dedicated Care Sector Skills Council.\n\n88 Niti\tAayog\tpaper\ton\t'\tSenior\tCare\tReforms\tin\tIndia\t-\tReimagining\tthe\tSenior\tCare\tParadigm:\tA\tPosition\tPaper', February, 2024\n\n89    Ibid; Note 70.\n\n- Public-private\t partnerships\t (PPP) could  play  a  significant  role  in  building  the care infrastructure, especially institutions for childcare and the elderly. Policies may be formulated to invest in mobile creches in offices, hospitals, and other public areas, encouraging women to take up paid employment opportunities.\n- Care services provision, both publicly run or privately operated facilities, would require institutional  oversight  and  continuous  monitoring .  This  ensures  that  the infrastructure is well-maintained and care services are satisfactory. In some countries, there are formal regulatory mechanisms to maintain defined minimum standards of infrastructure and service provision in care facilities. 90\n- Collaboration\twith\tcommunity-based\tand\tcivil\tsociety\torganisations\t(CSOs) can acquaint the system with ground-level reality and help address operational issues with the care infrastructure and financial constraints.\n- Subsidising\tcare\tservices can be considered. The successful international models of Australia, Argentina, Brazil, and the USA in this sector may offer valuable insights for India. These countries provide financial assistance through vouchers and tax rebates to the care workers based on their income, child's age, number of offspring, etc.\n- Owing\t to\t the\t SHGs'\t strong\t sense\t of\t entrepreneurship,\t the\t model\t of\t self-managed institutions,  for  example,  Jeevika  in  Bihar,  may  be  followed  to  provide  a  dedicated childcare services programme and a capacity-building programme for care workers.\n- Generating\tawareness\tabout\tcreches\tto\tcater\tto\tinformal\tworkers'\tlatent\tdemand\tfor affordable childcare.\n- Ground-level\t work\t with\t community\t groups\t and\t local\t decision-makers\t would\t bring contextualised management innovations for quality and sustainability.\n- Developing\tinnovative\tbusiness\tmodels\t-\tStart-up\tIndia\tcan\tbe\tleveraged\tto\tincentivise commercial and community-based models to pilot and scale up childcare support for women in the informal sector.\n- A\tRating\tsystem\tof\tcreches\tand\telderly\thomes\t-\ton\tthe\tlines\tof\tOFSTED\t(Office\tfor Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills) of the UK.\n\n8.74  The non-government sector has developed innovative solutions for the rising need for elderly  care  providers.  Tata-funded start-up Goodfellows 91 is  a  leading  initiative  attempting to tackle the challenge of loneliness, which has been termed as a serious health issue putting individuals  at  a  greater  risk  of  dementia  and  mental  decline. 92 This  start-up  hires  young people\tcalled\t'grandpals'\thaving\temotional\tintelligence\tand\tempathy\tto\tinteract\twith\tlonely senior  citizens  longing  for  companionship.  It  is  also  an  excellent  example  of  strengthening multigenerational communication and understanding, with mutual benefits.\n\n90    For  instance,  in  the  United  Kingdom,  the  Office  for  Standards  in  Education,  Children's  Services  and  Skills (OFSTED) inspects and regulates care services for children and young people. On similar lines, there is a need for institutional mechanisms in India for quality assurance of care service provision.\n\n91    Link to the website: https://www.thegoodfellows.in/\n\n92    Mushtaq R, Shoib S, Shah T, Mushtaq S.

Closer home, Haryana's recent crÃ¨che policy is notable for being the pioneer among Indian states, as per which working women can keep their child aged six months to six years in the crÃ¨che for eight to ten hours where skilled and trained personnel will be deployed. 94\n\n8.76  To  sum  up,  the  care  economy  is  a  top-tier  entry  in  India's  to-do  list  for  becoming  a developed nation by 2047. Not only does the availability of care infrastructure and services reduce women's time poverty and enhance FLFPR, but the provision of care infrastructure and services also acts as a standalone business opportunity, particularly suited for women-led entrepreneurship and women's employment. The care sector thus offers a vast potential for India's economic growth. While the attitudinal shift towards gender-neutral sharing of parental responsibilities would be gradual, policies can accentuate the shift. That requires creating a fair, efficient, and contextual ecosystem of affordable care services. The prevalence of smallscale care models (such as Mobile Creches 95 ) for more than half a century suggests that it is possible.",
