The government's social sector expenditure has increased, with a focus on health, education, and sanitation. Key initiatives include PM Ujjwala Yojana, Swachh Bharat Mission, and Ayushman Bharat Scheme. The government has also emphasized digital empowerment, with 52.6 crore Jan Dhan accounts opened and ₹38 lakh crore transferred via Direct Benefit Transfer. The National Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) has shown significant improvements in reducing poverty. The government has prioritized social enablers, including investments in health and sanitation, and has implemented targeted programs such as the Aspirational Districts Programme and the Aspirational Blocks Programme. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spending has also increased, with ₹1.53 lakh crore spent on CSR initiatives between 2014 and 2022. The government aims to continue its focus on welfare and development, with a goal-oriented approach to budgetary allocation and an emphasis on process reforms and accountability.\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n7.1 India is on the path to scaling the next level of the development ladder to a ' Developed India' step by 2047 (ViksitBharat@2047). Economic growth is a pathway to achieve the end goal  of  development  comprising  economic, social,  technological,  and  institutional  progress. However,  the  direction  of  public  policy  and  its  implementation  are  also  instrumental  in translating growth to across-the-board human development. Home to 18 per cent of humanity 1 , India's  social  infrastructure  must  reach  a  diverse  and  expansive  populace,  transcending cultures, languages, and geographies. Boasting a young and aspirational society, India aims to seize the opportunities provided by steady and high economic growth while also ensuring a  society  characterised  by  better  health  care,  education,  clean  water,  sanitation  facilities, affordable housing, electricity, and the internet. A vast amount of ground has been covered to ensure sustainable and equitable economic growth and the journey continues with challenges, old and new, as well as solutions, centralised and local.\n\n7.2 Over the last decade, the Indian concept of welfare has been significantly transformed into a more long-term-oriented, efficient, and empowering avatar. This has further strengthened the welfare ecosystem and helped lay a solid foundation for human development in the country.\n\n1  UN estimate https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/population\n\nBesides, the Government's social sector expenditure has been keeping pace with the sector's growing importance. The Government's spending on social services has shown a rising trend since FY16, with a focus on many aspects of the social well-being of citizens of the country, as evident from Table VII.1. Between FY18 and FY24, nominal GDP has grown at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 9.5 per cent. Overall, welfare expenditure has grown at a CAGR of 12.8 per cent. Expenditure on education has grown at a CAGR of 9.4 per cent- a tad below the rate of nominal GDP growth. Expenditure on health, as shown in the Table below, has grown at a CAGR of 15.8 per cent.\n\nTable VII.1 Trends in social services expenditure by general Government\n\n(Combined Centre and States)\n\n(₹ crore)\n\n| Items                            | 2017-18           | 2018-19           | 2019-20           | 2020-21           | 2021-22           | 2022-23 (RE)      | 2023-24 (BE)      |\n|----------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Total Expenditure                | 45,15,946         | 50,40,747         | 54,10,887         | 63,53,359         | 70,98,451         | 83,76,972         | 90,45,119         |\n| Expenditure on Social Services 2 | 11,39,524         | 12,78,124         | 13,64,906         | 14,79,389         | 17,87,019         | 21,49,346         | 23,50,584         |\n| of which:                        |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |                   |\n| Education 3                      | 4,83,481          | 5,26,481          | 5,79,575          | 5,75,834          | 6,39,436          | 7,68,946          | 8,28,747          |\n| Education (MoE's estimates)*     | 6,621,51          | 7,36,581          | 8,63,118 (RE)     | 9,19,145 (BE)     |                   |                   |                   |\n| Health 4                         | 2,43,388          | 2,65,813          | 2,72,648          | 3,17,687          | 4,56,109          | 5,12,742          | 5,85,706          |\n| Others                           | 4,12,655          | 4,85,829          | 5,12,683          | 5,85,868          | 6,91,474          | 8,67,659          | 9,36,131          |\n| As per cent ofGDP                | As per cent ofGDP | As per cent ofGDP | As per cent ofGDP | As per cent ofGDP | As per cent ofGDP | As per cent ofGDP | As per cent ofGDP |\n| Expenditure on Social Services   | 6.7               | 6.8               | 6.8               | 7.5               | 7.6               | 8.0               | 7.8               |\n| of which:                        | of which:         | of which:         | of which:         | of which:         | of which:         | of which:         | of which:         |\n| Education                        | 2.8               | 2.8               | 2.9               | 2.9               | 2.7               | 2.9               | 2.7               |\n| Education (MoE's estimates)*     | 3.9               | 3.9               | 4.3 (RE)          | 4.6 (BE)          |                   |                   |                   |\n| Health                           | 1.4               | 1.4               | 1.4               | 1.6               | 1.9               | 1.9               | 1.9               |\n| Others                           | 2.4               | 2.6               | 2.6               | 3.0               | 2.9               | 3.2               | 3.1               |\n\n2    Social services include education, sports, art, and culture;

While  RBI's  data  on  Education  expenditure  incorporates  the  spending  incurred  by  Centre  and States on 'Education, Sports, Arts, and culture, MoE's estimates also include expenditure incurred on medical and public health education, agriculture research and education, welfare of SC, ST, OBC &amp; Minority's education, other scientific research &amp; development, Education under social security, Nutritious food expenditure under midday meal, expenditure on imparting training to police, Labour employment and skill development expenditure, education/training  expenditure  under  rural  development  Programmes  etc.  This  leads  to  a  higher  estimate  of expenditure on education, which is 4.64 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 (latest available).\n\n7.3 This  chapter  presents  the  impact  of  the  high  economic  growth  in  recent  years  on  the citizens of the country. Section I discusses some critical outcomes in the overarching area of the standard of living of the populace. Some key areas, such as health, and education, are covered in some detail. In light of the emphasis on Nari Shakti , Section II dwells on the rising women power  in  the  country  and  the  active  role  of  Government  policies  and  programmes  in  this regard. A large population of the country resides in rural India. The developments happening at the grassroots level and the role of Government policies and programmes for rural India are presented in Section III.",
