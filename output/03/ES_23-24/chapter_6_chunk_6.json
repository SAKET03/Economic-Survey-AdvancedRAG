The country envisions a 'Viksit Bharat' by 2047, with Net Zero carbon emissions by 2070 guiding its interventions for high and robust economic growth. India faces challenges in balancing development needs with a low-carbon pathway. The global approach to dealing with climate change is flawed as it ignores trade-offs. Developed nations have postponed their climate-related targets, such as the UK delaying the ban on petrol and diesel vehicles from 2030 to 2035. Germany diluted its rules for banning boilers running on fossil fuels. The rise of alternative political parties in developed nations is attributed to public resistance to climate-related rules. Climate change continues to dominate policy and discourses worldwide. India's energy needs are expected to grow 2 to 2.5 times by 2047. The country aims to add 30 GW of solar capacity and reduce 720 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. India has made significant progress on climate action, achieving 40% cumulative electrical power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy sources in 2021. The country has updated its Nationally Determined Contribution, enhancing its targets. India submitted its Third National Communication and first Adaptation Communication to the UNFCCC in December 2023. The energy sector contributed the most to overall anthropogenic emissions at 75.81%. India's GDP grew at a CAGR of about 7% between 2005 and 2019, while emissions grew at a CAGR of about 4%. The country has successfully decoupled its economic growth from greenhouse gas emissions. India is on track to make an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3.0 billion tonnes through tree and forest cover by 2030. The country has adopted the mission-mode approach to address climate change through the National Action Plan on Climate Change. India has made significant progress in renewable energy, with a cumulative solar power capacity of 82.64 GW as of April 2024. The Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme has resulted in significant energy savings and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. India aims to reduce the emission intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030 from 2005 levels. The country has launched several initiatives to improve energy efficiency, including the Energy Conservation Building Code and the Standards and Labelling program. India's energy mix is expected to change significantly, with a share of non-fossil power capacity reaching 45.4% as of May 2024. The country aims to achieve Net Zero by 2070, requiring an orderly transition to a diversified mix of energy sources. India has launched initiatives such as PM-Surya Ghar Yojana to enhance renewable energy production. The country has also notified the national offshore wind energy policy and offshore wind energy lease rules. India's Green Hydrogen Mission targets 5 MMT of green hydrogen by 2030. The electrolysis and renewable energy used as inputs are major components of green hydrogen production cost. India faces challenges in energy transition, including intermittency and discontinuous supply of renewable energy. The country needs to develop energy storage systems, including battery storage. India has announced a viability gap funding scheme for offshore wind energy projects. The country aims to triple its global renewable energy capacity and accelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power. India has emphasized the importance of energy efficiency measures in accelerating clean energy transitions. The country has implemented several measures to improve energy efficiency, including the Perform, Achieve, and Trade scheme and the Standards and Labelling program. India's carbon market will allow the determination of a price for one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. The country has established the Indian Carbon Market to enable a per-output emissions limit. India aims to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve Net Zero by 2070. The country needs to enhance international cooperation in R&D, especially in domains such as distributed RE, offshore wind, and green hydrogen. India faces challenges in accessing affordable finance for its low-carbon development pathway. The country requires an estimated USD 2.5 trillion in investments to achieve its climate goals. India has taken several measures to improve the business environment and catalyze greater quantum of resources. The country has issued sovereign green bonds to raise proceeds for public sector projects. India's Mission LiFE aims to encourage the adoption of sustainable lifestyles to address climate change. The country supports voluntary environmental actions such as the Green Credit Programme. India has led several international initiatives towards climate change mitigation and building resilience. The country has established the International Solar Alliance to deploy solar energy solutions. India aims to interconnect solar energy systems on a massive scale through the One World, One Sun, One Grid initiative. The country has launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure to promote the resilience of new and existing infrastructure systems. India aims to achieve its ambitious growth targets while reducing carbon emissions. The country faces the dual challenge of meeting energy demands while reducing carbon emissions. India's energy needs are expected to grow significantly, and the country needs to target a diversified set of energy sources.\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Conclusion\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n6.54.  As  India  aims  to  achieve  its  ambitious  growth  targets,  it  faces  the  dual  challenge  of meeting energy demands while reducing carbon emissions. Given the close linkage between energy consumption and various social indicators, the Government has a priority to ensure access to sustainable and clean energy sources. Non-fossil fuel sources are critical to India's ambitious NDCs and Net Zero commitment. However, phasing in of non-fossil sources has its  challenges  -  intermittency  related  to  renewables,  handling  of  nuclear  and  solar  panel waste, implications of biofuel production on food security, etc. Depending on the evolving and ambitious NDC targets and the objective of ensuring energy security, it is amply clear that India needs to target a diversified set of energy sources. Such diversification will help minimise risks associated with energy systems while pursuing low-emission pathways in line with national commitments.  The integration of renewables, alongside exploring nuclear energy and biofuels, presents a path towards achieving these objectives. This will also include a significant role for thermal power, especially coal-based power plants, in providing base-load to support largescale deployment of renewables.\n\n6.55.  In exploring the landscape for ensuring energy security, it has become evident that risks are not merely obstacles but also harbingers of opportunities. While uncertainties loom, they present avenues for innovation, adaptation, and growth for India. While phasing in renewables to  the  extent  possible  is  imperative,  in  the  short  to  medium  term,  the  focus  should  also  be on actively adopting clean coal technologies.  The Government's initiatives for (cleaner) coal, such as the Coal Gasification Mission, extraction of Coal Bed Methane gases, exploring Coal to Hydrogen, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), and Coal beneficiation through washeries, etc. to mitigate emissions and enhance environmental sustainability needs to be promoted. With the advent of ultra super-critical technologies for coal power plants, it would be possible to lower emissions and achieve higher efficiency.\n\n79 Infrastructure for Resilient Island States (IRIS), UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Sustainable Development, https://sdgs.un.org/partnerships/infrastructure-resilient-island-states-iris.\n\n6.56.  India's successful renewable energy growth story is well-established. Solar power installed capacity has increased drastically by over 25 times between 2014 to 2023. However, several risks are associated with the large-scale phasing-in of renewables, such as intermittency, grid integration, backup power generation, storage, etc. It is important to supplement with other non-fossil fuel sources such as Nuclear, Biofuels, and Hydrogen.\n\n6.57. It  should  not  be  that  India's  high  dependency  on  imports  mainly  for  petroleum  for its energy needs, shifts to high import dependency for Solar PV panels and critical minerals (systemic risks), whose supply chain and geopolitics may be even trickier. India needs to target diversified energy sources, including renewables (Solar, Wind, Large and Small Hydro), green hydrogen, nuclear, and biofuels. Such diversification will help minimise risks associated with energy systems while pursuing low-emission pathways in line with national commitments. The diversification also includes a significant role for thermal power in providing the base load to support large-scale deployment of renewables.\n\n6.58.  Many technologies required for global Net Zero are commercially unavailable, such as hydrogen-fuelled Steel/Cement, Steel and Aluminium production with CCUS, etc. There is a need to enhance international cooperation in R&amp;D, especially in the domains of distributed RE, offshore wind, geothermal, tidal energy, biofuels, Compressed Bio Gas, green hydrogen, energy storage, electrolysers, and nuclear power (including Small Modular Reactors SMR).\n\n6.59.  Availability,  affordability,  and  accessibility  of  financial  resources  will  drive  the  green transition.  While  India  has  relied  upon  its  resources  so  far,  it  is  vital  that  resources  from developed countries and mobilised by the latter flow to the developing countries in line with the objectives of the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement. The negotiations on the New Collective Quantified Goal must lead to outcomes required to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement.  The  global  narrative  on  the  issue  of  climate  change,  describing  it  as  a  climate emergency, shifts focus from the equally, if not more, critical developmental problems and can cause panic. 80,81   The world needs a more balanced approach to the issue of climate change. It should also focus on nearer-term policy goals of improving human welfare rather than being excessively preoccupied with one large, longer-term goal of global climate management.\n\n********\n\n80 Hulme, M.
