The Indian stock market was among the best-performing markets, with India\\'s Nifty50 index ascending by 26.8% during FY24. The market capitalization of the Indian stock market has seen a remarkable surge, with the market capitalization to GDP ratio being the fifth largest in the world. \\n\\nThe pension sector witnessed a robust increase in subscribers and assets under management.

Credit growth remains robust, mainly driven by lending to services and personal loans. As mentioned in para 2.9-2.10, deposit growth has also gained momentum due to the transmission of previous rate increases, resulting in the repricing of deposits and higher accretion to term deposits. Lending by non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) accelerated, led by personal loans and loans to the industry, and their asset quality has improved.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Deployment of Bank Credit by Major Sectors, Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy, Table No. 170, RBI Note: Data includes the impact of merger of a non-bank with a bank\n\n9    Schumpeter, Joseph A.

Journal of Development Economics, 72(1), 321-334.\n\n2.17 Bank credit growth has sustained momentum during FY24, with broad-based growth across sectors. Credit disbursal by SCBs stood at ₹164.3 lakh crore, growing by 20.2 per cent at the end of March 2024, compared to 15 per cent growth at the end of March 2023. The trend is continuing in FY25, as reflected in a 19 per cent and 19.8 per cent YoY growth in bank credit in April and May 2024.\n\n## Sectoral credit growth\n\n2.18 Growth in credit to agriculture and allied activities was in double digits during FY24. Agricultural credit had increased nearly 1.5 times from ₹13.3 lakh crore in FY21 to ₹20.7 lakh crore in FY24. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has played a pivotal role in providing timely and hassle-free credit to farmers, with over 7.4 crore operative KCC accounts at the end of 2023. 11   Increased credit disbursal to the agricultural sector continued in April and May 2024 with bank credit to agriculture and allied sectors growing by 19.7 per cent and 21.6 per cent YoY, respectively\n\n2.19 Industrial  credit  growth  picked  up  in  H2  of  FY24,  registering  8.5  per  cent  growth  in March 2024, compared to 5.2 per cent a year ago, driven by an increase in bank credit to small and large industries. The boost in credit disbursal to Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) has been supported by the availability of collateral-free loans with a 100 per cent credit guarantee under the Emergency Credit Linked Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS). Further, the availability of enriched and timely credit data and rapid implementation of digital lending infrastructure  have  significantly  contributed  towards  enhancing  lender  confidence  Box  II.1 discusses the measures undertaken by the Government to ensure credit availability to MSMEs and their success. In the future, the development of new technologies, such as the Open Credit Enablement Network (OCEN) 12 , are expected to boost credit flow to the MSME sector.\n\n## Box II.1: Enhancing the flow of bank credit to MSMEs through  formalisation\n\nImproving credit  flow  to  the  MSME  sector  at  low  cost  has  been  a  policy  priority  of  the Government and RBI. Various initiatives have been undertaken in this regard. These are elaborated below 13 :-\n\n- Introduction  of  Trade  Receivables  Discounting  System  (TReDS): TReDS is  a  digital  platform  that  facilitates  the  discounting  of  MSMEs'  trade  receivables through multiple financiers- Banks and NBFCs- to meet liquidity and working capital requirements. Cumulatively, 98.9 lakh invoices amounting to ₹2.9 lakh crore have been discounted on TReDS platforms, as of 31 March, 2024 supporting MSMEs for better liquidity and working capital management.\n\n11 PIB Press Release of Ministry of Finance dated 27 December 2023, https://shorturl.at/EqWwK\n\n12 OCEN is a decentralised open credit network that codifies the flow of credit between borrowers, lenders, and credit distributors under a common set of standards. It is expected further to strengthen the digital public infrastructure of the country\n\n13 This box write up is based on information/data from the Ministry of MSME and UDYAM Portal, https://www.msme.gov.in/, https://udyamregistration.gov.in/\n\n- Change in definition of MSMEs: From 1 July 2020, MSMEs are defined as per a composite  criterion  of  turnover  and  investment  in  plant  and  machinery/equipment. This is envisaged to bring a large number of entrepreneurs under the ambit of the formal banking sector, which will facilitate the flow of credit to the industry at subsidised rates.\n- Registration of MSMEs on Udyam Portal: The Ministry of MSMEs launched the Udyam Registration Portal (URP) on 1 July 2020 and since then has established itself as an essential enabler for ease of doing business, as it is free of cost, simple and online. This was done to bring entrepreneurs under the ambit of the formal banking sector, which  will  facilitate  the  flow  of  credit  to  MSMEs  at  subsidised  rates.  However,  one challenge with URP is the registration of Informal Micro Enterprises (IMEs) which are sizeable in number. As per the 73rd National Sample Survey, 6.3 crore unincorporated non-agricultural entities existed in FY16, primarily micro-enterprises. Since IMEs do not have a PAN/GST, they cannot register on URP and avail themselves of the benefits of  Government  programmes.  To  formalise  such  enterprises,  the  Ministry  of  MSME, in  collaboration  with  the  Small  Industries  and  Development  Bank  of  India  (SIDBI), launched the Udyam Assist Platform (UAP) on 11 January 2023. Through formalisation, informal micro enterprises will be linked to various facilities such as access to markets and credit etc. As of June 2024, 1.86 crore IMEs have been onboarded on UAP. More than 4.5 crore enterprises have been registered on URP and UAP as of 3 June 2024.\n- Revamp of Credit Guarantee Scheme (CGS) for MSEs: In  the Union Budget FY23, the revamp of the CGS for Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) was announced with a required infusion of funds to facilitate an additional credit of ₹2 lakh crore for MSEs. Accordingly, the CGS was revamped with an infusion of ₹9,000 crore in the corpus of Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for MSEs. Subsequently, the credit limit under the said scheme was enhanced from ₹2 crore to ₹ 5 crore, with a minimum annual guarantee fee of as low as 0.37 per cent per annum. Consequently, credit guarantees worth ₹3 lakh crore were approved during FY23 and FY24 against the target of ₹2 lakh crore in four years. During FY23, out of the guarantees of ₹1.04 lakh crore, ₹16,373 crore and ₹2,750 crore were extended to women and SC/ST-owned enterprises, respectively. Guarantees worth ₹2.02 lakh crore were extended in FY24, out of which ₹32,223 crore and ₹5,393 crore were extended to women &amp; SC/ST-owned enterprises, respectively.\n\nTo ensure credit availability to IMEs, w.e.f 14 February 2024, the Ministry of MSME made a special provision under the existing CGS for MSEs providing that IMEs registered on UAP can avail of credit up to ₹20 lakh without primary security and with 85 per cent guarantee coverage  and  a  reduced  annual  guarantee  fee.  Additionally,  initiating  legal  action  is  not required for financial institutions to invoke the guarantee.\n\n2.20 Bank credit disbursal to the services sector remained resilient despite a slowdown in credit growth to NBFCs. Within the services sector, credit disbursal to the 'commercial real estate' and 'trade' sub-sectors improved in H2 of FY24. Personal loans and NBFCs have the largest share of credit disbursed by banks. Within personal loans, housing loan growth remained range-bound during FY24, with signs of improvement in April and May 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource: Deployment of Bank Credit by Major Sectors, Handbook of Statistics on Indian Economy, Table No. 170, RBI Note: Data includes the impact of merger of a non-bank with a bank\n\n2.21 Credit disbursal for housing loans increased from ₹19.9 lakh crore in March 2023 to ₹27.2  lakh  crore  in  March  2024.  Credit  growth  in  personal  loans  can  be  attributed  to  the significant  digitalisation  of  the  ecosystem  with  increased  use  of  credit  bureaus  for  faster decisions, data collation and validation and e-commerce transactions. However, personal loan growth moderated after December 2023 due to increased capital requirements for unsecured personal loans, credit cards and lending to NBFCs by the RBI from 100 per cent to 125 per cent. 14, 15\n\n## Improvement in asset quality of banks\n\n2.22 There has been a significant enhancement in the asset quality of banks, led by improved borrower selection, more effective debt recovery and heightened debt awareness among large borrowers. 16   In addition to regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, qualitative metrics such as enhanced disclosures, robust code of conduct, and transparent governance structures have also improved banking performance.\n\n2.23 The gross non-performing assets (GNPA) ratio of SCBs continued its downward trend, reaching a 12-year low of 2.8 per cent at the end of March 2024 from its peak of 11.2 per cent in FY18. Lower slippages and a reduction in outstanding GNPAs through recoveries, upgradations\n\n14 RBI notification, 'Regulatory measures towards consumer credit and bank credit to NBFCs', dated 16 November 2023, https:// rbi.org.in/Scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12567&amp;Mode=0\n\n15   As per the RBI Annual Report 2023-24\n\n16  Ibid 15\n\nand write-offs led to this decrease. The improvement in SCBs' asset quality has been broadbased. The GNPA ratio of the agriculture sector remains high at 6.5 per cent at the end of March 2024, but it has recorded persistent improvement during H2 of FY24. The GNPA ratio in the personal loans segment improved across all categories. Asset quality improved across all significant sub-sectors within the industrial sector, barring vehicles and transport equipment. Lower GNPAs and high provisions accumulated in recent years contributed to a decline in net NPAs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.24 As  SCBs  bolstered  their  capital  base  by  capitalising  reserves  from  higher  profits  and raising fresh capital, their CRAR  increased to 16.8 per cent at the end of March 2024. As of the end of March 2024, all banks met this as well as the CET-1 ratio 17 requirement of 13.9 per cent, well above the regulatory minimum.\n\n2.25 The net interest margin (NIM) of SCBs remained robust at 3.6 per cent in March 2024. With growing net interest income and other operating income  and as the need for additional provisions fell, their profit after tax rose by 32.5 per cent (YoY) in March 2024, in spite of a large increase in operating expenses. Profitability indicators remained strong, with return on equity (RoE) and return on assets (RoA) ratios touching decadal highs in March 2024. Lagged effects of transmission of monetary policy rate increases and shifts in liquidity conditions led to a 100 basis points increase in the cost of funds as against the 75 basis points rise in the yield on assets in FY24. The yield on assets further improved due to the rise in interest rates.\n\n2.26 It is important to note that in its annual report on 'Trend and Progress of in Banking in India 2021-22', RBI observed that a high NIM is negatively correlated with financial stability. Still, the threshold above which a high NIM is antithetical to financial stability is 5 per cent. The\n\n17   Common Equity Tier 1 refers to the sum of common shares (equivalent for non-joint stock companies) and stock surplus, retained earnings, other comprehensive income, qualifying minority interest and regulatory adjustments\n\nNIM of SCBs is well below that. It peaked at 3.9 per cent in Q1 of FY24, after which it moderated to 3.6 per cent as of March 2024.\n\nConsistent improvement in performance indicators\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.27 India's banking sector has shown remarkable resilience. The macro-and micro-prudential measures by RBI and the Government have enhanced risk absorption capacity in recent years, improving the banking system's stability. The RBI's Basic Statistical Returns 2 (Deposits with SCBs) reveal that as of March 2024, 56.9 per cent of India's deposits are with Public Sector Banks (PSBs). 61.1 per cent of total deposits are owned by households considered sticky retail customers; therefore, deposit withdrawals in this category, in case of an adverse event, are likely to remain limited. Second, for the top 10 Indian banks in asset size, loans constitute more\n\nthan 50 per cent of their total assets, making banks immune to the rising interest rate cycle. Third, after a phase of recapitalisation and cleaning up of bank balance sheets during the past years, there is a visible improvement in various banking indicators. The CRAR for the top 10 SCB (based on asset size) has been well above Basel III Norms. Fourth, interest rate cycles have been quite prominent in India, aligning with RBI's financial conditions and goal to maintain economic stability and manage inflationary pressures. The exposure to regular interest rate cycles has made Indian banks well-equipped to handle the cycles.\n\n2.28 Based on the analysis mentioned above, it is seen that the Indian banking system remains sound and resilient, backed by high capital adequacy ratio, improved asset quality and robust earnings growth. The trend of improvement in the profitability of SCBs, which began in FY20, continued for the fifth consecutive year in FY24. This has been aided by higher income and lower provisions and contingencies.\n\n## Dealing with distressed assets\n\n2.29 The  ability  to  resolve  stres s  in  the  market  is  a  measure  of  an  economy's  soundness, and the ability to do so in the face of an economic slowdown is an essential indicator of the economy's resilience. The last decade saw Indian commercial banks face a crisis due to the significant burden of NPA. As of March 2016, the GNPA ratio of the public sector banks was 14.5 per cent.  The other side of this was the plateauing of the bank debt, which fuelled an increase in corporate leverage, leading to the twin-balance sheet problem. Maximum stress was in the industry and infrastructure sectors.\n\n2.30 The Government has paid close attention to resolving stress in banks and corporations over  the  past  decade.  Measures  such  as  strengthening  the  banking  regulatory  framework, amending the recovery laws, enacting comprehensive insolvency and bankruptcy legislation, and  establishing  a  public  sector  asset  reconstruction  company  were  implemented.  These measures have nursed the credit sector back to sound health, and the GNPA ratio shrunk to 2.8 per cent in March 2024.\n\n2.31 The emergence of stress in the market due to the operation of market forces and the subsequent business/venture failures is a sign of an active and dynamic economy. Since banks form the most significant and predominant source of finance for businesses in India, banks need to be equipped to deal with the flow of distressed assets, and the markets need to be equipped to channel investments into the reconstruction and revival of such assets.\n\n2.32 Banking regulations provide for monitoring and timely identification of stressed assets, and RBI has taken several measures to strengthen its prudential framework. Regulations also provide measures to address stress at its initial stages through restructuring and rescheduling loans. The broad contours of these options form a part of banks' risk management tool kit. Banking regulations form the first line of defence and measures to address stress. The RBI updates them in response to market needs and economic conditions.\n\n## Conventional channels of recovery and reconstruction\n\n2.33 The recovery routes viz., Debt Recovery Tribunals (DRTs) and the Securitisation and Reconstruction  of  Financial  Assets  and  Enforcement  of  Security  Interest  (SARFAESI)  Act, 2002, form the second line of measures available to address stress. During FY23, around 45 per cent of the reduction in GNPAs of SCBs was contributed by recoveries and upgradations. 18\n\n2.34 The Asset Reconstruction Companies (ARCs) 19 regulated under the SARFAESI Act are emerging as an alternative channel for investors, including FPIs , to access the NPAs/distressed assets held by banks. During FY23, 28 ARCs were operating in the market. 20 Such acquisition is done by issuing security receipts (SRs), and ARCs are mandated to take at least 15 per cent of the SRs issued or 2.5 per cent of the total SRs issued, whichever is higher. The regulatory framework has allowed the ARCs to participate as resolution applicants under the IBC process subject to certain conditions. It has thereby allowed  harnessing the synergies and complementarities of the two market channels of asset reconstruction. During FY23, 9.7 per cent of the previous year's stock of SCBs' GNPAs was sold to ARCs, compared to only 3.2 per cent in FY22. The number  of  SRs  ultimately  redeemed  increased  during  FY23,  indicating  enhanced  recovery through this mode.\n\n2.35 The  prerequisites  for  an  efficient  market  for  the  NPAs  are  that  it  should  be  deep, competitive and have adequate liquidity. The market has to have enough investors to ensure that the price discovery of the NPAs is efficient. It has to have adequate liquidity to support acquisition from the banks and support asset's turn-around. Apart from direct measures taken to reduce the GNPAs, the Government is building systemic strength in the market with marketbased  interventions  to  improve  liquidity  and  competition  by  establishing  a  bad  bank  and encouraging the insolvency and bankruptcy ecosystem.\n\n2.36 The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has implemented several measures to  improve  liquidity  in  the  market  for  distressed  assets.  FPIs  are  permitted  to  invest  in debt  instruments  issued  by  companies  undergoing  resolution  and  in  SRs  issued  by  ARCs. No minimum investor limit or residual maturity requirement is imposed on FPIs for these investments. These measures have led to an increase in FPI investment in SRs issued by ARCs from around ₹10,000 crore to ₹14,482 crore during FY22 21 . SEBI also opened a particular route in 2022, the Special Situation Fund, a sub-component of the Alternative Investment Funds, to participate in the distressed asset market. It allowed these investment vehicles to invest in SRs issued by ARCs and to act as resolution applicants under the IBC process subject to certain conditions. With increased access to funds, market participants are likely to invest in more NPAs/distressed assets, and the recovery rate for banks is expected to be higher.\n\n18  RBI Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2022-23, Page 80, https://shorturl.at/dOXt1\n\n19 ARCs are entities registered with the RBI and are permitted to acquire financial assets, including loans, advances, bonds, guarantees and letters of credit from banks/financial institutions for reconstruction\n\n20 https://tinyurl.com/56vmwnkv\n\n21 RBI Report on Trend and Progress of Banking in India 2021-22, https://shorturl.at/yx9n4\n\n## Increasing competition in the distressed asset market\n\n2.37 To deepen the distressed asset market further, the Government, in July 2021, set up the National Asset Reconstruction Company Ltd. (NARCL) and India Debt Resolution Company Ltd. (IDRCL). NARCL acquires assets from banks, and the Government guarantees back the SRs  issued  against  these  assets.  The  India  Debt  Resolution  Company  Ltd  (IDRCL)  has  an exclusive  arrangement  with  NARCL  to  resolve  assets  acquired  by  the  latter.  The  IDRCL  is mandated to identify the appropriate resolution strategy for the asset and to aid NARCL in optimal resolution outcomes. The assets acquired by the NARCL clear the bank balance sheets immediately, freeing capital for further lending.\n\n2.38 NARCL has so far acquired 18 accounts with loan exposure of around ₹92,000 crore 22 , which includes the acquisition of the ailing Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd and Srei Equipment Finance  Ltd  as  resolution  applicants.  While  offers  on  assets  worth  ₹1.25  lakh  crore  are  at different stages of acquisition, due diligence, and evaluations for assets of around ₹40,000 crore are underway. The establishment of a government-backed company for the aggregation and resolution of distressed assets will further improve liquidity and competition in the market.\n\n## Addressing distressed assets through insolvency resolution\n\n2.39 The IBC has been recognised as an effective solution for the twin balance sheet problem, where banks are under the stress of NPAs while corporates are overleveraged and unable to repay their debt. The Code provides for addressing financial distress early in time. It mandates the insolvency professional to conduct the insolvency process and run the operations of the distressed corporate debtor. At the same time, the committee of creditors steers the resolution process and all significant decisions, thus reducing further erosion of value during the process itself. By design and operation, the Code balances the needs of all stakeholders. IBC has provided an avenue for corporate debtors to resolve their debt and get an honourable exit from failed business endeavours, thus promoting ease of doing business and encouraging entrepreneurship. The Code has established itself as an effective solution for addressing banks' stress by aiding in significantly reducing GNPAs and helping rescue failing corporate debtors. It has offered fresh  impetus  to  the  recovery  segment  of  the  financial  markets  and  the  reconstruction  of failed/distressed  assets  in  the  real  sector.    In  the  eight  years  since  2016,  31,394  corporate debtors involving a value of ₹13.9 lakh crore have been disposed of (including pre-admission case disposals) as of March 2024. The loss of control immediately after admission into the resolution process has led debtors to settle with creditors as soon as the applications are filed with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). A singularly notable fact is that ₹10.2 lakh crore of underlying defaults were addressed at the pre-admission stage. 23   This change in debtor\n\n22  Data of the Department of Financial Services\n\n23 Source:  IBBI  newsletter,  January-March  2024,  https://ibbi.gov.in/uploads  publication/21aa7620a9e809f7a20b432eec89888b. pdf\n\nbehaviour has been a big boon for banks and other lending institutions. The Code has created an optimal incentive-disincentive mix to facilitate  above-board and transparent dealings in creditor-debtor relations.\n\nRemarkable progress in cases resolved under the IBC and realisation by creditors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.40 The Code uses the corporate insolvency resolution processes (CIRPs) to identify the best means to resolve a distressed asset. It has facilitated the successful closure of 4,131 CIRPs until March 2024. 3,171 corporate debtors have been rescued, of which 947 cases have been resolved through approved resolution plans, which brought in a realisable value of ₹3.36 lakh crore. In the resolved cases, the creditors recovered approximately 32 per cent of their claims. This amounted to a recovery of 85 per cent of the fair value and 162 per cent of the liquidation value of assets.\n\n- 2.41 The impact of IBC on the health of the financial markets is evident as it is the dominant recovery route for SCBs  today. 24   As per the RBI's Report on Trends and Progress of Banking in India, 2022-23, the IBC held a share of 43 per cent of the total amount recovered by SCBs in FY23. In the six years since FY18, the IBC has enabled over ₹3 lakh crore recovery for the SCBs, more than what they have recovered through the Lok Adalats, DRTs, and the SARFAESI Act.\n\n2.42 More significant to the real sector is that over 3,000 businesses have emerged out of the CIRP, with continued business operations extending the productive use of resources trapped due to financial distress in these corporate debtors. A study conducted by the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, reports 25   that the resolved firms that went through the resolution process  under  the  Code  have  witnessed  a  significant  improvement  in  their  performance  in\n\n24  It is important to note that the foremost objective of the Code is resolution of stressed corporate debtors. Recovery of claims is only incidental to the process of resolution.\n\n25 IIM Ahmedabad report, 'Effectiveness of the Resolution process: From Outcomes in the Post-IBC Period', https://ibbi.gov.in/ uploads/resources/59f737b213b4700cc16428aefd62869a.pdf\n\nterms of increase in tangible assets and average capex in the post-resolution period compared to the pre-resolution period, the aggregate market valuation of resolved firms rose from around ₹2 lakh crore in the pre-resolution phase to ₹6 lakh crore in the post-resolution phase. There is a substantial increase in total employment and around a 50 per cent increase in the average employee expenses in the resolved firms (listed) in the three years post-resolution. It is hard to find another policy measure that has created winners.\n\n2.43 As of March 2024, the total CIRPs ending in liquidation were 2,476. Around 77 per cent of these corporate debtors were defunct at the beginning of the process and were, on average, valued at 7 per cent of the outstanding debt.  The liquidation process provides a last window of opportunity for the revival of the asset through a going concern Sale/Compromise/Arrangement to maximise the value rescued. Around 50 businesses have been rescued at this last resort. 586 firms were dissolved at the end of the liquidation process, releasing whatever resources were needed for alternate uses.\n\n2.44 Nine of the  twelve  large  accounts 26 referred  by  the  RBI  for  resolution  under  the  IBC have been resolved. The resolution plans for these corporate debtors yielded 54 per cent of the claims admitted. These debtors included steel and power majors such as Electrosteel Steels Ltd., Bhushan Steel Ltd., Monnet Ispat &amp; Energy Ltd., Essar Steel India Ltd., Bhushan Power &amp; Steel Ltd., etc., and their resolutions played a significant role in the revival of the steel sector. The framework under Section 227 of the IBC provides for the resolution of financial  service providers, and, at present, NBFCs, including Housing Finance Companies with asset size of ₹500 crore or more, are covered. The framework has enabled the resolution of Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd., Srei Equipment Finance Limited and Srei Infrastructure Finance Limited under this  framework. In each case, the creditors have recovered around 42 per cent of the claims. Box II.2 discusses the role of the IBC process in resolving financial stress of real estate companies.\n\n## Box II.2: Role of IBC in reviving stalled real estate projects and strengthening homebuyers' rights\n\nBefore 2016, the only remedy available for homebuyers whose housing projects were stalled for various reasons was through the Consumer Forums established under the Consumer Protection Act of 1986. In FY24, over 5,500 27 cases were filed with the National Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, and almost 21 per cent were related to the housing sector. However, the number of cases resolved through the consumer redressal route has been minimal. It  was  estimated  that  4.1  lakh  dwelling  units  in  real  estate  projects  across  the country involving ₹4.1 lakh crore were under stress. 28\n\n26   The first set of corporate debtors referred by RBI for resolution under the IBC.\n\n27 CONFONET Dashboard at https://cms.nic.in/ncdrcusersWeb/dashboard.do?method=loadDashBoardPub as reflected on 21 May 2024\n\n28  Model Building Bye-Laws 2016 Towns and Country Planning Organisation, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, https:// mohua.gov.in/upload/uploadfiles/files/report(1).pdf\n\nThe year 2016 saw the enactment of the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act 2016  (RERA  Act).  This  provided  a  dedicated  grievance  redressal  mechanism  to  the aggrieved homebuyers and a means to rein in errant real estate contractors and companies. Subsequent enactment of the IBC in the same year opened another channel and has been the most favoured among the three available remedies. As of March 2024, over 1500 real estate companies were admitted into the insolvency resolution process under the IBC, accounting for 21 per cent of total admissions. One in four cases settled after admission was also from this sector. Of the 891 corporate debtors resolved, 133 were real estate companies, forming 15 per cent of the companies resolved.\n\nInsolvency  resolution  of  real  estate  companies  posed  a  unique  set  of  challenges  for  the standardised corporate insolvency process. Real estate companies have multiple projects spread  across  geographies,  projects  at  different  stages  of  construction,  and  diversified business models. The large number of homebuyers across these projects meant claims from thousands  of  homebuyers  who  needed  to  be  included  in  the  process.  The  judiciary,  the Government, and the market have recognised these difficulties and moved in cohesive steps to improve outcomes for these projects. The availability of two new remedial routes led to discord and friction in the system.\n\nThe Insolvency Law Committee, in its March 2018 29 report took cognisance of the peculiarity of  the  real  estate  sector.  It  recommended  that  the  amount  raised  from  homebuyers  be considered financial debt as it formed a significant contribution to finances raised and had the commercial effect of borrowing. This led to substantial changes in the CIRP by making homebuyers a distinguished class of creditors and a part of the Committee of Creditors, enabling  their  direct  participation  in  decision-making.  A  system  to  organise  and  derive decisions, through consensus of majority voting of the thousands of homebuyers, was also worked out to  introduce  insolvency  professionals  as  authorised  representatives.  Further amendments enabled insolvency to be initiated by a joint application of not less than 100 allottees or not less than 10 per cent of the total number of allottees under the same project, ensuring that frivolous applications are not filed. As clarity emerged on the use of IBC as a remedy for homebuyers, it was also laid out that resolution plans approved for real estate projects should necessarily be compliant with the RERA Act, thereby restoring primacy to the sectoral law and the sectoral regulator in its domain for optimal oversight of the sector.\n\nBy way of innovation in economic law, the judiciary paved the way for solutions in resolving real estate corporate debtors. As a class of creditors, it enabled homebuyers to act as resolution applicants. It approved what was termed a 'reverse CIRP', where the corporate debtor could take measures to complete the project even as the resolution process was underway. The judiciary has allowed project-specific resolution plans, targeting the affected project alone under the same corporate debtor. This measure relieved the corporate debtors and allottees of different projects, and the market has responded positively.\n\n29  Ministry of Corporate Affairs report of the Insolvency Law Committee, March 2018, https://ibbi.gov.in/uploads/resources/ ILRReport2603\\_03042018.pdf\n\nSeveral real estate companies have successfully resolved and enabled the progress of stalled projects. In the case of Value Infracon India Private Limited, the resolution process yielded creditors 98 per cent of the claim value and 189 per cent of the asset's liquidation value.\n\nIn the cases of Ashiana Landcraft Realty Private Limited and Anudan Properties Private Limited, the resolutions yielded around 2.5 times the liquidation value of the assets. Large corporate debtors in the sector, like Jaypee Infratech Limited, have been resolved with a recovery of 88 per cent for creditors, and assets have been acquired at over 114 per cent of liquidation value. 30\n\nEven as the pace of resolutions picked up under the IBC, there was still a need to channel/ redirect investments into these stressed projects. To address this vital gap, the Government set up the Special Window for Affordable and Mid-Income Housing (SWAMIH) with a target corpus  of  ₹12,500  crore  in  2019.  It  is  a  professionally  managed  Alternative  Investment Fund (AIF) aimed at providing priority debt financing for the completion of stalled housing projects, including corporate debtors and projects undergoing the resolution process under the  Code.  As  of  April  2024,  the  SWAMIH  Fund  has  delivered  32,000+  homes  and  the delivery of 20,000 homes every year for the next three years is being targeted.\n\nThe  impact  of  seamless  resolutions  and  progress  of  cases  under  IBC  and  improvement in  liquidity  through  the  AIF  is  reflected  in  the  healthy  balance  sheets  of  banks,  thereby enhancing their ability to lend further.\n\n2.45 The Government has taken several measures to improve the insolvency ecosystem. It has strengthened the NCLT regarding infrastructure, increasing its strength by filling vacancies and proposing an integrated IT platform. The regulations have been amended to keep in line with the needs of the markets and the advances in judicial pronouncements. The IBC has established itself as an indispensable component of the asset recovery and reconstruction market. In the process, it has forever changed the credit market landscape in the country for good.\n\n## Financial inclusion is within reach; digital financial inclusion is the next goal\n\n2.46 Financial inclusion is not just a goal but also a means to an end as an enabler for sustainable economic growth, reduction of inequality and elimination of poverty. The United Nations (UN) has positioned financial inclusion as a prominent enabler of other development goals in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Academic evidence states that financial inclusion can enhance overall economic growth and facilitate the achievement of different SDGs.\n\n2.47 The  Government  has  prioritised  delivering  financial  services  to  the  last  mile.  Given the low levels of financial inclusion and formal identification in 2008, the magnitude of the challenges facing India a little over a decade ago was immense. According to the World Bank's Global  Financial  Inclusion  Database,  India  has  made  remarkable  progress  in  its  financial inclusion  goals  over  the  past  ten  years.  The  number  of  adults  with  an  account  in  a  formal financial institution increased from 35 per cent in 2011 to 77 per cent in 2021.  There has been\n\n30 As per data as reflected in the summary of outcomes released by IBBI, https://ibbi.gov.in/en/claims/cd-summary\n\nan increase in the percentage of adults saving in a financial institution and borrowing from formal sources. There is a decline in the access gap between the rich and the poor. Further, the gender divide in terms of financial inclusion has also narrowed. While progress has been made on gender in financial inclusion, India's youth are seeing the same benefits (Table II.2). Compared to South Asian and world averages, it is seen that India's performance is better in specific indicators (Table II.3).\n\n2.48 Based on the bank account data and the relationship with GDP per capita, one rough estimate is that it would have taken 47 years to achieve 80 per cent of adults with a bank account had India solely relied on traditional growth processes. 31\n\nTable II.2: India's performance across indicators of financial inclusion and financial education\n\n|   S.No. | Indicators of Financial Inclusion                                     | 2011   |   2021 |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n|       1 | Adults with an account at a formal financial institution (%, age 15+) | 35     |     77 |\n|       2 | Made or received a digital payment (% age 15+)                        | 22*    |     35 |\n|       3 | Borrowed from a formal financial institution, older (% age 15+)       | 8      |     12 |\n|       4 | Account, poorest 40% (% age 15+)                                      | 27     |     78 |\n|       5 | Account, richest 60% (% age 15+)                                      | 41     |     77 |\n|       6 | Account, female (% age 15+)                                           | 26     |     78 |\n|       7 | Account, male (% age 15+)                                             | 44     |     78 |\n|       8 | Youth (age 15-24 years) made or received digital payment              | 19*    |     30 |\n\nSource: World Bank's Global Financial Inclusion Database\n\nNote: *data is for 2014, as data for 2011 is not available\n\nTable II.3: A cross-country comparison of financial inclusion and financial education parameters\n\n|              |   Adults with an account at a formal financial institution (%, age 15+) |   Adults saving at a financial institution (% ages 25+) |   Borrowed from a formal financial institution, older (% age 25+) |\n|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| World        |                                                                      76 |                                                      29 |                                                                32 |\n| South Asia   |                                                                      68 |                                                      11 |                                                                12 |\n| Brazil       |                                                                      84 |                                                      23 |                                                                42 |\n| China        |                                                                      89 |                                                      45 |                                                                42 |\n| India        |                                                                      78 |                                                      13 |                                                                13 |\n| Indonesia    |                                                                      52 |                                                      20 |                                                                15 |\n| South Africa |                                                                      85 |                                                      37 |                                                                20 |\n\nSource: World Bank's Global Financial Inclusion Database, Data for 2021 (latest available)\n\n- 2.49 More recently, there has been a shift in focus of the financial inclusion strategy in the country, from 'every household' to 'every adult,' with added emphasis on the usage of accounts\n\n31 BIS Papers No 106: The design of digital financial infrastructure: lessons from India by Derryl D'Silva, Zuzana Filková, Frank Packer  and  Siddharth  Tiwari,  Monetary  and  Economic  Department,  December  2019,  (https://www.bis.org/publ/bppdf/ bispap106.pdf)\n\nby enhancing direct benefit transfer (DBT) flows through these accounts, promoting digital payments using RuPay cards, UPI etc. The RBI launched UPI123Pay in March 2022 as an option to make UPI payments for feature phones, and the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) introduced UPI Lite, an on-device wallet service provided by select banks that allows low-value transactions up to ₹200 through the BHIM app. These innovations are steps towards accelerating the digital adoption process in India by creating a more prosperous and inclusive ecosystem that can accommodate larger sections of the population. India is also collaborating with several countries to bring more efficiency to national and cross-border payment systems.\n\n2.50 RBI  has  been  collaborating  bilaterally  with  various  countries  to  link  India's  Fast Payments System (FPS), i.e., UPI, with their respective FPSs for cross-border Person to Person (P2P) and Person to Merchant (P2M) payments. The RBI joined Project Nexus, a multilateral international initiative to enable instant cross-border retail payments by interlinking domestic FPSs. The Nexus aims to connect the FPSs of four ASEAN countries (Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) and India, who would be the founding members and first mover countries of this platform. An agreement to this effect was signed by the BIS and the central banks of the founding countries on 30 June 2024. 32   The platform is expected to go live by 2026. Once functional, Nexus is expected to play an important role in making retail cross-border payments efficient, faster, and more cost-effective.\n\n2.51 The main components of the RBI's strategy for financial inclusion have been a target-based approach,  market  development,  strengthening  infrastructure,  innovation,  and  technology, last-mile delivery, consumer protection and financial literacy and awareness. 33  Following this strategy, the progress on financial inclusion so far is presented below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Digital Financial Inclusion\n\n2.52 A key enabler of this financial inclusion drive has been the digitalisation of the financial system, which has catalysed the transformation of the financial services landscape worldwide. With financial services now available on tap on digital devices, the next big challenge is to ensure 'Digital financial inclusion (DFI).' DFI involves arranging cost-effective digital means to reach currently financially excluded and underserved citizens with a range of formal financial services suited to their needs. The essential components of DFI include the availability of digital transactional platforms to enable customers to make or receive payments and devices to enable such transactions. These retail agents have digital devices and additional financial services via a digital transactional platform.\n\n2.53 While  measures  were  afoot  towards  digitisation  of  financial  services  in  India,  the COVID-19 pandemic gave further momentum to the process when the most vulnerable and excluded citizens were severely affected. The Government, accordingly, encouraged innovation and developed a well-stacked digital infrastructure and technology-led system. This has evolved into an inclusive, cost-efficient, and responsible DPI.\n\n2.54 With the objective of India emerging as a fintech nation, the Government has launched many flagship schemes such as the Digital India Mission, Make-in-India, etc. Greater emphasis has  been  given  to  the  creation  of  DPI  such  as  Aadhaar,  e-KYC,  Aadhaar-enabled  Payment System, UPI, Bharat QR, DigiLocker, e-sign, Account Aggregator, Open Network for Digital Commerce, etc. These DPIs can be utilised on a shared basis by different players to ensure optimum outcomes. Their usage has brought transparency, scale operation and timely delivery of financial services to the public.\n\n2.55 India's robust DPI has played a pivotal role in enabling the country's digital transformation, providing citizen-centric and transparent governance services. India's fast-growing population, world-class DPI, and proactive regulations have underpinned the Fintech industry's growth. India is among the fastest-growing fintech markets in the World, hailing as the third-largest growing fintech economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNote: Figures as of July 2024,\n\nSource: Dashboard of respective schemes/programmes\n\n2.56 Advances in DFI have enabled millions of people in the formal and vast informal economy to  accept  payments, settle invoices, and transfer funds anywhere in the country with just a few screen taps. These advances are built on the India Stack, a comprehensive digital identity, payment, and data-management system. India Stack consists of three interconnected layers that provide a digital identity to every Indian while facilitating easy, cost-free, mobile-first digital transactions. The three critical components of India Stack 34  are the Identity Layer, payment layer and data governance layer. Regarding the identity layer, Aadhaar has been instrumental in transforming India's authentication ecosystem. It has facilitated the KYC process, reducing the cost of conducting e-KYC from USD 12 to 6 cents, extending banking to millions of Indians and improving financial inclusion. In the case of the payment layer, the UPI has revolutionised the  country's  payment  system.  The  success  of  UPI  has  been  enhanced  by  the  expansion  of smartphone usage in India, with more than 116.5 crore smartphone subscribers as of 31 March 2024. 35   The value of transactions conducted on the UPI platform has increased multifold from ₹0.07 lakh crore in FY17 to ₹200 lakh crore in FY24. 36  The data governance layer focuses on ensuring ownership and control over the user data to its rightful owners.\n\n2.57 Digital credit can be a powerful agent for sustainable and inclusive growth by empowering individuals  and  firms  to  cultivate  economic  opportunities.  According  to  the  International Monetary Fund (IMF) research, an increase in digital financial inclusion in payments leads to a 2.2 per cent rise in average economic growth, likely driven through the consumption channel and higher formalisation. 37\n\n## Microfinance institutions: facilitating financial inclusion\n\n'Access to formal finance can boost job creation, reduce vulnerability to economic shocks and increase investment in human capital. With adequate access to financial services, individuals and firms can rely on costly informal sources of finance to meet their financial needs and pursue  growth  opportunities.  At  a  macro  level,  greater  financial  inclusion  can  support sustainable and inclusive socio-economic growth for all.'\n\n## - National Strategy for Financial Inclusion 2019-24, RBI\n\n2.58 Microfinance  refers  to  providing  financial  services,  including  small-value  loans  to households, small businesses and entrepreneurs who lack access to formal banking services. It is an effective tool for financial inclusion, which involves sustainably providing microfinance and  related  services  to  enable  the  poor  and  the  marginalised  to  achieve  social  equity  and empowerment.  Microfinance  has  been  playing  an  essential  role  in  meeting  low-income households' credit needs by providing affordable doorstep services.

Two hundred and thirteen MFIs operate in India as of FY23, with a branch network of 25,790, engaging 2.2 lakh employees. Together, they have reached out to over 532 lakh clients with a total loan outstanding of ₹1.8 lakh crore under micro-credit. 41 The addition of new clients reflects the continuing inclusion efforts of the sector and offers hope for the remoter and underserved geographies.

As  an  SRO,  Sa-Dhan  has  been  at  the  forefront  of  formulating  and  administering  industry regulations, tools, and performance standards for effective monitoring of MFIs, their compliance with regulations and the Code of Conduct in the best interest of clients.\n\n39  https://mfinindia.org/\n\n40 Inclusive Finance India Report, 2023, Access Development  Services, https://inclusivefinanceindia.org/wp-content/ uploads/2023/12/IFI-Report-2023.pdf\n\n41 Bharat Microfinance Report, 2023, Sa-dhan, https://rb.gy/hnq8z0\n\nloans outstanding with MFIs, including those overdue over 179 days, was 571 lakhs. Out of these, the active clients (excluding the clients having overdue over 179 days) served by MFIs stood at 532 lakhs, posting a YoY growth of 19 per cent.\n\n2.62 Though MFIs serve both rural and urban poor, they are oriented more towards rural areas in India. Urban borrowers dominated for a while.There is a definite shift thereafter towards the rural sector, and it has continued for the last four years. The present share of the rural clientele is at 74 per cent.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2.63 Microfinance  is  mostly  a  woman-focused  activity.  Women  constitute  98  per  cent  of the total clients of MFIs. Further, it also serves other weaker and marginalised sections like scheduled castes (SC), scheduled tribes (ST) and minorities in a significant way. The SC/ST borrowers constitute a substantial 23 per cent of the clients.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\n2.64 Disbursement of loans by MFIs recorded steady growth throughout, except in some years due to external events like the COVID-19 pandemic, etc. During FY23, the microfinance sector bounced back strongly, achieving an aggregate disbursement of ₹1.8 lakh crore, 55 per cent higher than the previous year.\n\n2.65 The performance and profitability ratios of MFIs during FY23 provide a picture of good health and improving prospects of the industry. The industry managed to trim operating costs while retaining finance costs at more or less the same level as in previous years. The total assets of the MFIs stood at ₹1.5 lakh crore at the end of FY23, 30 per cent higher than the previous year. The sector has been going from strength to strength for the last few years, except for one or two years in between owing to some external events. In FY23, RoA and RoE stood at 2.5 per cent and 12.2 per cent for all MFIs, reflecting an improvement over the previous year. As per the RBI regulatory norms, NBFC-MFIs need to maintain at least 15 per cent of their riskweighted assets in the form of capital. The capital adequacy of Indian MFIs is largely well above the prescribed norms, with the median CAR for FY23 at 26.5 per cent.\n\n2.66 During FY23, good progress in enhancing portfolio quality has been achieved by the MFIs, as they have been able to rein in defaults, improve recoveries, and deal with chronic cases  through  settlements  and  write-offs.  The  Performance  and  Accountability  Reporting (PAR) 30+ ratios for MFIs are moving towards pre-COVID levels but are still short of the lowest delinquency ratios achieved in FY19. The CRIF-Highmark analysis shows that, during FY23, MFIs were able to reduce forward flows of impaired loans 42  from one bucket to the next in the case of 30, 60, and 90-day PAR. However, the forward flows in the 91 to 180-day buckets increased for MFIs and banks. 43\n\n2.67 The success  of  the  microfinance  sector  in  rural  India  can  be  measured  using  several indicators. The most extensive microfinance programme, the SHG-Bank Linkage Programme (SHG-BLP), has captured the post-pandemic recovery through the number and amount of SHGs with loans outstanding with banks over FY22 and FY23. During FY23, the credit disbursement under SHG-BLP was ₹1.5 lakh crore, registering a growth of 45.6 per cent. The number of SHGs credit linked during FY23 increased to 43 lakh from 34 lakh in FY22. As of March 2023, the banking system held SHG savings to the tune of ₹58,893 crore with a growth of 24.7 per cent, with average savings per SHG amounting to ₹43,940. 44   The improvement in the RBI's Financial Inclusion Index from 60.1 in March 2023 to 64.2 in March 2024 indicates the strides being made in the area of access, usage, and quality of the financial sector in India. 45\n\n42  An impaired loan is a loan that is not performing according to the original terms of the agreement.\n\n43 Volume XXIII of CRIF Quarterly publication on Microfinance lending, 'MicroLend', March 2023, https://www.crifhighmark. com/media/2921/crif-microlend-vol-xxiii\\_mar-2023.pdf\n\n44 Status of Microfinance in India 2022-23, https://shorturl.at/Blzyn\n\n45  The FI-Index has been conceptualised as a comprehensive index incorporating details of banking, investments, insurance, postal, as well as the pension sector in consultation with the Government and respective sectoral regulators.
