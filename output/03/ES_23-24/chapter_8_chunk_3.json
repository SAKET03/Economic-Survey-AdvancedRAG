This  evolution  is  a  result  of  various  factors,  including  economic  reforms, technological  advancements, and an emphasis on skill development. The slew of structural reforms promoting ease of doing business, undertaken in the last decade and ongoing, remain crucial for productive employment generation in the current decade.\n\n8.4 According to the annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) by the National Statistical Organisation, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), the all-India annual unemployment rate (UR) 1  (persons aged 15 years and above, as per usual status 2 ) has been witnessing a declining trend since the COVID-19 pandemic. This has been accompanied by a rise in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) 3  and worker-to-population ratio (WPR) 4 . Even  by  the  relatively  strict  standards  of  current  weekly  status  (CWS) 5 ,  employment  has recovered from the pandemic in urban and rural areas.\n\n8.5 The quarterly PLFS reports for urban areas enable a more updated picture of employment. The quarterly urban unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and above declined to 6.7 per cent in the quarter ending March 2024 from 6.8 per cent in the corresponding quarter of the previous year, accompanied by a rise in the WPR and LFPR (Chart VIII.2).\n\n1    UR is defined as the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force.\n\n2    For a person to be categorised as employed as per usual status (ps+ss), he/she must have pursued an economic activity for at least 30 days during the 365 days preceding the date of the survey.\n\n3    According to the PLFS, LFPR is the percentage of working-age population engaged in work or making tangible efforts to seek 'work' or being available for 'work' if it is available. 'Work' includes self-employment (subsistence agriculture  and  collection  of  firewood,  poultry  farming,  etc.,  for  self-consumption),  regular  wage/salaried employment, and casual labour.\n\n4    WPR is defined as the percentage of employed persons in the total population.\n\n5    In the case of CWS, the activity status is determined on the basis of a reference period of the last 7 days preceding the date of the survey\n\n## Chart VIII.1: Improving annual labour market indicators (July-June period)\n\n## (a) Usual status, aged 15 years and above\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n(b) Current Weekly status, aged 15 years and above\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: PLFS, MoSPI\n\nNote: Figures for ages 15 years and above, the period of the survey for 2022-23 is July 2023 to June 2024, and likewise for other years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.6 India's workforce is estimated to be nearly 56.5 crore in 2022-23 using WPR from PLFS and MoHFW's population projections. According to PLFS, more than 45 per cent of the workforce is employed in agriculture, 11.4 per cent in manufacturing, 28.9 per cent in services, and 13.0 per cent is in construction. The predominance of agriculture in the providing employment to nearly half of the population, especially females, is both a challenge and an opportunity, as explained in the section on agro-processing in this chapter.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Annual PLFS report 2022-23, MoSPI\n\nNote: The 'other services' category includes activities belonging to publishing, consultancy services, information services, financial and insurance services, real estate, legal and accounting, advertising, health and education services, tours and travels, arts, entertainment and recreation, etc.\n\n8.7 In terms of employment status of workers, 57.3 per cent of the total workforce is selfemployed, and 18.3 per cent is working as unpaid workers in household enterprises. Casual labour comprises 21.8 per cent of the total workforce and regular wage/salaried workers are 20.9 per cent of the total workforce. Gender-wise, it is the female workforce, which is shifting to self-employment, while the male workforce's share has been stable. This is evident in the sharp rise in female LFPR in the past six years (discussed in later in this chapter), driven by rural women joining agriculture and related activities.\n\n<!-- image -->",
