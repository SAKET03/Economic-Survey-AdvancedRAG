  "content": "Chapter 3 Summary:\nThe chapter discusses India's inflation management, focusing on prices and inflation. The pandemic and geopolitical tensions presented challenges to global economic stability, affecting India significantly. Supply disruptions and increased commodity prices led to elevated inflationary pressures in FY23 and FY24. However, prudent monetary policy responses and calibrated trade policy measures helped reduce core inflation to a four-year low in FY24. Food inflation was mitigated through administrative actions, including dynamic stock management and subsidized provision of essential food items. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) inflation projections indicate a benign and range-bound inflation outlook for India. India's retail inflation was 5.4% in FY24, the lowest since the Covid-19 pandemic. The inflation rate was within the target range of 2-6% in 2023. India's inflation management was relatively better compared to developed and emerging economies. The chapter highlights key policy recommendations, including strengthening price monitoring mechanisms, increasing domestic production of essential food items, and improving storage and processing facilities for vegetables. The RBI and IMF project India's consumer price inflation to align towards the inflation target in FY26, with projected inflation rates of 4.5% in FY25 and 4.1% in FY26. The World Bank expects a 3% decline in the commodity price index in 2024 and a 4% decrease in 2025. The chapter emphasizes the importance of focused efforts to increase the production of major oilseeds, pulses, and other essential food items to stabilize domestic prices and mitigate import dependence.\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Interstate Variations in Retail Inflation\n\n## INTERSTATE VARIATIONS IN RETAIL INFLATION\n\n3.25. Consistent with the decline in the all-India average retail inflation rate in FY24 compared to FY23, inflation in most States and Union Territories (UTs) decreased. The inflation rate was less than 6 per cent in 29 out of the 36 States and Union Territories.\n\nChart III.24:Interstate variations in retail inflation (%) in FY24\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Prepared from Consumer Price Indices released by CSO, MoSPI\n\n## Interstate variations in inflation are more pronounced in rural areas\n\n3.26. The rural consumption basket has a much higher weightage of food items (47.3%) than the  urban (29.6%). Hence, in the last two years, States that witnessed elevated food prices also experienced higher rural inflation. It is also found that the inter-state variation calculated through standard deviation is higher in rural than urban inflation. Besides, States with higher overall inflation also tend to exhibit a wider rural-to-urban inflation gap, with rural inflation\n\nexceeding urban inflation. A scatter plot of overall inflation for different States against their rural-to-urban inflation ratio reveals a positive correlation. For instance, the difference between rural and urban inflation in Haryana was much wider compared with Goa, which had relatively lower inflation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",
