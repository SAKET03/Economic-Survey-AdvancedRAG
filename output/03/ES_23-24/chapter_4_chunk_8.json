  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nIndia's external sector remained strong amidst ongoing geopolitical headwinds and sticky inflation. Merchandise exports moderated due to lower demand from major trading partners, but services exports continued to perform well, cushioning the overall trade deficit from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24. Lower prices of imported commodities, including crude oil, also helped. The current account deficit (CAD) improved due to moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports. Software/IT services drove an increase in overall exports, while business services exports also rose, supported by India emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India's participation in global value chains (GVCs) increased, with the share of GVC-related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3% in 2022 from 35.1% in 2019. The country's rank in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023. India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows of USD 44.1 billion in FY24, supported by strong economic growth, a stable business environment, and increased investor confidence. The Indian Rupee remained in a manageable range of ₹82 to ₹83.5/USD in FY24 and was the least volatile currency among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies. The shock absorbers of India's external sector, including forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, and a market-determined exchange rate, are in place to cushion global headwinds. Going forward, the changing composition of India's export basket, enhancement in trade-related infrastructure, enhanced quality consciousness and product safety considerations in the private sector, and a stable policy environment are expected to drive India's rise as a global supplier of goods and services. India's trade openness indicator rose from 37.5 in FY05 to 45.9 in FY24, contributing significantly to economic growth. The share of trade (excluding petroleum products exports and crude oil imports) in GDP rose from 32.3% in FY05 to 40.8% in FY23. India's merchandise exports contracted in H2 of FY23 and H1 of FY24 due to geopolitical tensions but showed a trend reversal in H2 of FY24. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed to USD 238.3 billion in FY24 from USD 264.9 billion in the previous year. Non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery merchandise exports showed resilience with a sustained uptick, resulting in exports worth USD 320.2 billion in FY24, 1.5% higher than the previous year. India's defence production grew substantially from ₹74,054 crore in FY17 to ₹108,684 crore in FY23, boosting defence exports. India's toy exports registered a CAGR of 15.9% between FY13 and FY24, transforming India from a deficit to a surplus nation in the trade of toys. Footwear exports increased from USD 1.9 billion in FY21 to USD 2.5 billion in FY24. Smartphone exports ranked among India's top five export items, with a 42.2% increase in exports in FY24. India's domestic production and exports of smartphones have been increasing steadily, with significant changes achieved since the launch of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020.\n\nSubchapter 8 Content:\n# Outlook and Challenges\n\n## OUTLOOK AND CHALLENGES\n\n4.84  Though ongoing geopolitical headwinds impacted India's merchandise exports, lowering international commodity prices ensured a lower trade deficit in FY24 than in FY23. A  narrowing  merchandise  trade  deficit  and  rising  service  exports  have  improved  the  CAD, ending with a surplus of 0.6 per cent of GDP in Q4 of FY24. In the coming years, India's trade deficit is expected to decline further as the PLI scheme is expanded and India creates a globally competitive manufacturing base in several product categories. Further, the recently signed FTAs are expected to increase the global market share of the country's exports. Various international agencies and RBI expect the CAD to GDP to moderate to below one per cent for FY24, driven by growing merchandise and services exports and resilient remittances.\n\n4.85 However, the risks to the performance of India's external sector are on the downside due  to  the  persistence  of  current  geopolitical  tensions  and  policy  uncertainty.  Some  of  the challenges are mentioned below: -\n\n-  Fall in demand from major trading partners: As per the DGCIS data, the US was India's  second-largest  trading  partner  in  FY24  after  China.  However,  the  USA's  overall import volume declined by 1.7 per cent in 2023 compared to a growth of 8.6 per cent in 2022, as  per  OECD. This significantly influenced export growth in trading partners, including\n\nIndia. 115  Rising protectionism is another risk that could undermine trade recovery in 2024 and 2025.\n\n-  Rise  in  trade  cost: Attacks  on  shipping  in  the  Red  Sea  and  drought  in  the  Panama Canal  have  resulted  in  trade  flows  being  re-routed,  increasing  journey  time  and  costs as  mentioned  in  para  4.8  above.  India's  merchandise  trade  relies  heavily  on  maritime trade, so disturbances in major shipping routes can impact its economy. A CRISIL report 116 highlighted that the Red Sea crisis has impacted the Middle East's fertiliser exports to India as imports of the Muriate of Potash from Jordan and Israel have been affected.\n-  Commodity price volatility: Fluctuations in commodity prices, especially for critical imports like oil, metals, and agricultural products, can impact India's trade balance and inflation  levels.  Disappointing  global  growth  presents  a  downside  risk,  especially  for industrial commodities. Additional trade restrictions could push food prices higher.\n-  Trade policy changes: Changes in trade policies by major trading partners or geopolitical developments can affect India's export opportunities and market access. As per the WTO's Trade Monitoring Report, November 2023 117 , the pace of WTO members' implementation of new export restrictions has increased significantly since 2020. 75 export restrictions on food, feed and fertilisers are still in place globally, in addition to 20 COVID-19-related export restrictions. For 2023, the trade covered by import restrictions in force was estimated at USD 2,480 billion, representing almost one-tenth of total world imports.\n\n4.86 It is critical to explore what these changing paradigms mean for India. Policies need to be a mix that straddles security concerns with economic considerations. India's push towards manufacturing in complex and niche sectors through schemes such as PLI and Make in India aims  to  balance  these  goals.  On  the  other  hand,  India's  edge  in  services  will  catalyse  our globalisation over the coming years. A recent paper by the Peterson Institute for International Economics 118 , asserts that globalisation in services is ongoing, even as we are past the era of hyperglobalised trade in goods. This implies that the global demand for India's services sector exports is here to stay.\n\n4.87 India  is  simultaneously  working  towards  unlocking  the  potential  gains  from  growing integration  by  augmenting  the  logistics  front.  This  is  evident  from  the  large  infrastructure deals which have been signed to ramp up trade. For instance, the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is expected to shorten trade time for shipments to Russia and Europe.  Another  major  joint  infrastructure  deal,  the  India-Middle  East  Europe  corridor (IMEC), will connect Asia with Europe via ports and railroads. Similarly, there is a concerted effort towards striking trade agreements with countries spanning geographies.\n\n115  OECD Economic Outlook, May 2024, https://www.oecd.org/economic-outlook/may-2024/\n\n116  https://tinyurl.com/2xf5cb6x\n\n117 WTO end year Trade Monitoring Report November 2023, https://www.wto.org/english/news\\_e/spno\\_e/spno42\\_e.htm 118  Ibid, Note 37.\n\n4.88 Ultimately, India needs to focus on improving its competitiveness in many product areas. For example, India has tremendous potential in becoming a large global exporter in agricultural commodities. Fostering stronger regional trade ties and adding more markets for Indian goods will help mitigate global demand fluctuations. In an era when global economic growth is likely to be buffeted by geopolitical tensions and protectionism, growing India's exports of goods and services will be a stiffer challenge than before. Product safety and quality consciousness in the private sector and policy stability in the public sector are obvious starting points to turn the challenge into an opportunity.\n\n********",
