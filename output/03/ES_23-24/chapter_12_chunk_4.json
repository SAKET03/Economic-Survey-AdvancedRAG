See 'failed_generation' for more details.\", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'tool_use_failed', 'failed_generation': \"The Indian government has initiated several measures to overcome the pandemic-driven slowdown in the economy, including increasing capital expenditure, particularly in high-quality physical and social infrastructure facilities. The capital expenditure of the government has seen an almost three-fold increase in FY24 relative to FY20 levels, with major beneficiaries being key foundational assets like roads and railways.\\n\\nThe government has also implemented institutional and procedural reforms to facilitate project execution and timely issue resolutions, including initiatives to enhance private sector participation through PPPs, and measures like National Infrastructure Pipeline and Project Monitoring Group. The chapter highlights that with increased public investment over the last five years, India has witnessed significant expansion in physical and digital connectivity and social infrastructure.\\n\\nThe creation of resilient, world-class infrastructure is a key plank of India's policy strategy to become Viksit Bharat @2047. The chapter examines recent developments in India's infrastructure space, with a special focus on progress achieved in FY24. The chapter is divided into six sections, investigating infrastructure financing, sectoral developments, challenges, and outlook.\\n\\nInfrastructure financing in India still relies heavily on capital expenditure by the Union and State Governments. Despite financial innovations, public expenditure continues to play a central role in funding large-scale infrastructure projects. The capital expenditure of the Union Government increased by 2.2 times from FY21 to FY24, while that of State governments increased by 2.1 times during the same period.\\n\\nThe share of gross budgetary support to two key connectivity segments, Railways and National Highway Authority of India, in the total capital expenditure of the Union Government increased from 36.4% in FY21 to 42.9% in FY24. The aggregate investible resources of CPSEs, consisting of GBS and resources raised by CPSEs, have been optimized to reduce borrowing costs.\\n\\nThe net flow of funds to infrastructure sectors through bank credit between March 2023 to March 2024 was around ₹79,000 crore. The credit growth to infrastructure sectors in FY24 recovered to 6.5%, as against the growth of 2.3% in FY23. The gross inflow of external commercial borrowings to infrastructure sectors picked up to USD 9.05 billion in FY24.\\n\\nThe resource mobilization by infrastructure sectors through debt and equity issuances in the capital market was just over ₹1,00,000 crore during FY24. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have raised ₹18,840 crore from 2019 to 2024, while Infrastructure investment trusts (InvITs) raised a total of ₹1,11,294 crore in the last five years.\\n\\nThe National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) was announced in August 2021, with an aggregate monetization potential of ₹6.0 lakh crore over four years. During the first two years, transactions aggregating to about ₹2.3 lakh crore in accruals or private investments were completed under the core asset monetization program.\\n\\nThe development of expressways and corridors, along with transformative initiatives, has been the highlight of the recent road sector growth journey. The Bharatmala Pariyojana has significantly expanded the national highway network, increasing the length of high-speed corridors by 12 times and 4-lane roads by 2.6 times between 2014 and 2024.\\n\\nThe average pace of NH construction increased by ~3 times from 11.7 km per day in FY14 to ~34 km per day by FY24. The Indian Railways' capital expenditure increased by 77% over the past 5 years, with significant investments in new lines, gauge conversion, and doubling.\\n\\nThe power transmission system in India is connected into one grid running on one frequency, with an inter-regional capability of transferring 1,18,740 megawatts. The peak electricity demand increased by 13% to 243 GW in FY24. The renewable energy sector received approximately USD 17.88 billion as FDI from April 2000 until March 2024.\\n\\nThe Jal Jeevan Mission was launched in August 2019 to provide a tap water connection to every rural household by 2024 with a total outlay of ₹3.6 lakh crore. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) was launched in 2015 to provide pucca houses with basic amenities to all eligible beneficiaries in urban areas.\\n\\nThe Smart Cities Mission was launched in June 2015 to promote cities that provide core infrastructure, clean and sustainable environment, and give a decent quality of life to their citizens. The Swachh Bharat Mission Urban focuses on ensuring every citizen, including the poor household of urban India, has access to sanitation facilities.\\n\\nThe tourism sector has seen significant growth, with 29 new sites identified for development under the PRASHAD scheme. The Indian space sector has seen remarkable progress, with 55 active space assets, including 18 communication satellites and 20 Earth Observation satellites.\\n\\nThe digital infrastructure in India has been improving, with the usage and underlying technologies of telecommunications undergoing massive changes. The Government has introduced guidelines for the Spectrum Regulatory Sandbox to foster innovation and enhance ease of doing business in the telecommunications sector.\\n\\nThe electronics and information technology sector has seen significant growth, with the Government envisioning the India AI program as a mission-centric approach for leveraging transformative technologies. The India AI program aims to democratize access to AI innovation pillars and ensure global competitiveness of India's AI ecosystem.\\n\\nThe chapter highlights several challenges, including land-related issues, skill demands, need to improve private participation, climate and environmental sustainability, and lack of aggregation of financial flows into infrastructure. The government has launched several initiatives to address these challenges, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline, Project Monitoring Group, and PM GatiShakti National Master Plan.\\n\\nThe National Logistics Policy was launched in September 2022 to complement PMGS-NMP, aiming to drive business competitiveness through an integrated, efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective logistics network. The policy aims to reduce the cost of logistics, improve the Logistics Performance Index ranking, and create a data-driven decision support mechanism for an efficient logistics ecosystem.\\n\\nOverall, the chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments in India's infrastructure space, highlighting the progress achieved in FY24, and the challenges and opportunities ahead.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Developments across infrastructure sectors\n\n## DEVELOPMENTS ACROSS INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS\n\n12.12. This section discusses the progress in key infrastructure sectors along with outlook and challenges, including covering physical connectivity, electricity, water and sanitation, urban\n\n6 Asset Monetization Pipeline.pdf (niti.gov.in) -https://tinyurl.com/mw3bdr74\n\ndevelopment, strategic and digital infrastructure. An attempt has been made to present only the details relating to infrastructure development in this chapter, leaving the discussion on infrastructure-related services to chapter on services.\n\n## Physical Connectivity Infrastructure\n\n## Road Transport\n\n12.13. Strategic planning and step-up in public investment have resulted in the upgradation of the road network system into a resilient and efficient infrastructure. The capital investment by the Government and private sector rose from 0.4 per cent in FY15 to about 1.0 per cent of GDP (around ₹3.01 lakh crore) in FY24. The sector has attracted its highest-ever private investment in FY24 as the private sector capitalises on a conducive policy environment. Further, tapping on the private investment, funds garnered through asset monetisation in the roads sector have exceeded ₹1 lakh crore since FY19. Notably, the Government achieved its highest-ever asset monetisation revenues of ₹40,314 crore in FY24.\n\n12.14. Over the last ten years, there has been significant progress in the development of national highways, increasing by 1.6 times from 2014 to 2024. The Bharatmala Pariyojana has significantly expanded the national highway network, increasing the length of high-speed corridors by 12 times and 4-lane roads by 2.6 times between 2014 and 2024. Further, the efficiency of highway construction has improved due to the systematic push through the corridor-based National Highway development approach. The average pace of NH construction increased by ~3 times from 11.7 km per day in FY14 to ~34 km per day by FY24. The remarkable improvement of the NH network has brought about substantial advancements in logistics efficiency. This is evidenced by the consistently rising India's ranking in the World Bank's 'Logistics Performance Index, from 54 in 2014 and 44 in 2018, to 38 in 2023.\n\nSource: Union Budget Documents, Inputs Received from Ministry of Road Transport and Highways\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.15. To  further  enhance  logistic  efficiency,  Ministry  of  Road  Transport  &amp;  Highways (MoRT&amp;H) has dedicated Multi-Modal  Logistics  Parks  (MMLP).  A  total  of  six  multimodal logistics parks (MMLPs) have been awarded until FY24, and ₹2,505 crore have been awarded for dedicated multimodal logistics parks (MMLPs) in FY24. Further, seven MMLPs are planned to be awarded in FY25.\n\n## Box XII.2: Key Initiatives Enhancing Road Connectivity\n\n- Toll digitisation has reduced waiting time at toll plazas by nearly 16 times from 734 seconds to 47 seconds during 2014-24 7 . Free flow tolling through Automatic Number Plate Recognition/Global Navigation Satellite System has also been initiated.\n- About 900 wayside amenities (WSAs) are planned to be established to provide worldclass facilities and amenities. 322 WSAs have already been awarded out of which 50 are operational. In FY24 alone, 162 WSAs have been awarded.\n- A proactive policy for NH maintenance has been adopted by engaging a contractual maintenance agency for each km of the entire NH network. Contractual maintenance is  done  either  through  performance-based  maintenance  contracts  or  short-term maintenance  contracts.  About  37,500  km  of  NH  network  has  been  taken  up  under these two maintenance contracts. Long-term maintenance contracts on developed NH stretches of about 20 years have also been undertaken through toll operate transfer and infrastructure investment trust mode.\n- Sustainable raw materials and new-age construction techniques have been incorporated into highway development. 13.79 lakh tonnes of inert material from landfill sites have been  used  in  urban  extension  road-II  and  spur  of  the  Delhi-Mumbai  expressway. Recycling of bitumen &amp; asphalt is done during the brownfield upgradation of NHs.\n- High-tech machinery and cloud-based data-driven construction have resulted in time and cost reduction.\n- Under the 'Parvatmala Pariyojana' to boost last-mile religious and tourist connectivity, six  ropeway  projects  have  been  awarded.  Bids  have  been  received  for  another  two projects.\n\n12.16. Outlook: The  development  of  expressways  and  corridors,  along  with  the  adoption of  transformative initiatives to promote user convenience and environmental sustainability, have been the highlight of the recent road sector growth journey. However, continuous ribbon development along developed NHs is posing a challenge for the construction of a new parallel road/bypass.  Now,  the  Government  has  started  focusing  on  the  development  of  accesscontrolled NHs. The Government is also targeting to make all NHs a minimum of two lanes with paved shoulders standards. Another challenge is the slow onboarding of digital land records, leading to land acquisition delays. This is further impacted by delays in approvals for forest and other environmental clearances.\n\n## Box XII.3:Key Initiatives for Road Development\n\n## Development of Rural Roads - Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY)\n\n- PMGSY-I launched in December 2000, to provide connectivity through an all-weather road  with  necessary  culverts  and  cross-drainage  structures  to  eligible  unconnected habitations in rural areas.\n- PMGSY-II  launched  in  2013  to  upgrade  50,000  km  of  selected  through-routes  and major rural links (MRLs) in various states and union territories.\n- In  2016,  a  road  connectivity  project  for  strategically  important  roads  in  left-wing extremism affected areas was launched as a separate vertical under PMGSY.\n- PMGSY-III launched in 2019 for consolidation of 1,25,000 km through routes and MRLs connecting  habitations,  inter-alia,  to  gramin  agricultural  markets,  higher  secondary schools, and hospitals.\n- A total of 8,29,409 km of road length has been sanctioned under PMGSY out of which, 7,63,308 km of road length has been completed as on 18 th  June 2024 under various interventions/verticals of PMGSY at an expenditure of ₹3.23 lakh crore (including state share).\n- 99.6 per cent of the targeted habitations under PMGSY-I have been provided connectivity.\n\n## Development of Industrial Corridors\n\n- The Government is developing 11 industrial corridor projects as part of the national industrial corridor programme in a phased manner. These include industrial corridors connecting Delhi-Mumbai, Chennai-Bengaluru, Amritsar Kolkata , East Coast and Vizag Chennai  Corridor,  Bengaluru-Mumbai,  Extension  of  CBIC  to  Kochi  via  Coimbatore, Hyderabad-Nagpur,  Hyderabad-Warangal,  Hyderabad-Bengaluru,  Delhi-Nagpur  and Odisha Economic Corridor.\n- The programme is aimed at providing multi-modal connectivity with complete 'plug and play' infrastructure until the plot level with resilient and sustainable future-ready cities.\n- A total of 308 Plots (1,789 acres) have been allotted until March 2024 in four cities.\n- At present, about 2,104 acres of developed industrial land and 2,250 acres of commercial/ residential/ other land use are readily available for allotment.\n\n## Rail Transport\n\n12.17. Indian Railways, with over 68,584 route km (as of 31 st  March 2023) and 12.54 lakh employees  (as  of  1 st April  2024),  is  the  fourth  largest  network  in  the  world  under  single management. Capital expenditure on Railways has increased by 77 per cent over the past 5 years (₹2.62 lakh crore in FY24) with significant investments in the construction of new lines, gauge conversion, and doubling.\n\nSource: Ministry of Railways\n\nNote: P stands for Provisional\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Box XII. 4: Initiatives for Railway Enhancement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Box XII. 4: Initiatives for Railway Enhancement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Box XII. 4: Initiatives for Railway Enhancement                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Amrit Bharat Station Scheme                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Mumbai-Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) project                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Dedicated freight corridors (DFCs)                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ● Launched in August 2023 for developmentofstations on a continuous basis. ● Involves preparation of master plans and its phased implementation to improve amenities, building improvements, multimodal integration, and sustainability. ● 1,324 stations have been identified for upgradation so far. | ● Under this 508 Km project, executed with co- operation from Govt. of Japan, land acquisition and civil conduct award have been completed. ● Overall physical progress of 41.7 per cent has been achieved and financial expenditure of ₹59,291 crore was incurred until 31 st March 2024. | ● Two DFCs are under i mpl e ment a t i o n namely the eastern DFC with route length of 1,337 kilometre and the western DFC with route length of 1,506 kilometre. ● By the end of FY24, 96.1 per cent of the total DFC route length has been completed. |\n\n12.18. Railways  achieved  its  highest-ever  production  for  both  locomotives  and  wagons  in FY24. Fifty one pairs of Vande Bharat have been introduced until March 2024. The fast pace of infrastructure augmentation has been the result of a substantial increase in financial allocation along with close project monitoring and regular follow-up with stakeholders for expeditious land acquisition and clearances.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.19.

The notification of the Inland Vessels Act 2021, was aimed at replacing the over 100 years old Inland Vessels Act of 1917, making the legislative framework user-friendly.\n\n12.30.  Capital expenditure by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) for FY24 was ₹1010.5 crore. Based on feasibility and detailed project reports prepared for 106 new National Waterways (NWs), technical interventions have been planned for safe navigation and shipping on technically viable waterways. Over 63 per cent of the Jal Marg Vikas Project on NW-1 has been completed as of March 2024. Phase-I development of NW-3, NW-4, NW-5 &amp; 13 new NWs was approved at a cost of ₹267 crore for 2025-2026.\n\n12.31. The Indo Bangladesh Protocol (IBP) route, developed jointly by India and Bangladesh at an estimated cost of ₹305.84 Crore, provides an alternate connectivity for all North-eastern states from Guwahati and Jogighopa to Kolkata and Haldia ports. With the initiatives taken in last 9 years, the cargo handled via IBP route has increased significantly.\n\n## Civil Aviation\n\n12.32.  India  is  amongst  the  fastest-growing  aviation  markets  globally.  The  Government has a capital expenditure plan of more than ₹26,000 crore for the period FY20 to FY25 to develop, upgrade and modernise airports to meet international standards. Out of the planned expenditure, the Airport Authority of India (AAI) has achieved around ₹23,000 crore during FY20 to FY24. PPP and other airport operators have incurred an amount of around ₹49,000 crore during the same period, taking the total capital expenditure of around ₹72,000 crore in the airport sector during the last 5 years.\n\n11    As per Chapter 15, Report of the National Transport Policy Committee 1980) India's navigable inland waterways extend nearly 14,500 kilometers, comprising a variety of river systems, canals, backwaters, creeks, and tidal inlets. These include all waterways navigable by country boats. Source: Government of India, Ministry of Shipping &amp; Transport, Report of the Committee on National Waterways, 1974, p. 58'\n\n12.33.  21 Greenfield airports were accorded in-principle approval, out of which 12 airports have  been  operationalised.  During  FY24,  new  terminal  buildings  at  21  airports  have  been operationalised which has led to an overall increase in passenger handling capacity of these airports  by  approximately  62  million  passengers  per  annum.  During  last  seven  years,  after commencement of Ude Desh ka Aam Nagrik (UDAN) Regional Connectivity Scheme (RCS), 1,390 valid awarded routes have been allotted to various airlines. Out of this, 579 RCS routes connecting 85 unserved and underserved airports have been operationalized.\n\n## Box XII. 7: New Segments - Drones, Leasing and MRO\n\n- Drones  offer  vast  benefits  across  sectors  like  agriculture,  healthcare,  disaster  relief, surveillance, and defence. The Government introduced liberalized drone rules in 2021. Other measures include publishing drone airspace maps, implementing a PLI scheme, and introducing a drone certification scheme. Key progress includes the establishment of  109  training  organisations  and  the  issuance  of  10,603  remote  pilot  certificates, 22,943 unique identification numbers for registered drones, and 67 DGCA-approved Type-Certificate for drone models.\n- The  Government  is  promoting  aircraft  leasing  through  the  International  Financial Services  Centre  (IFSC)  at  GIFT  City.  More  than  28  aircraft  lessors  have  already registered, which have together leased more than 20 aircraft and 49 aircraft engines. Recently, Air India has commenced leasing of its wide body aircrafts from the IFSC zone and other airlines are also in process of establishing leasing company in IFSC .\n- Realising the potential of the MRO industry in India, the Government has introduced several policies and regulations to bring India's MRO sector at par with global peers. MROs in India have enhanced their capacities in traditional segments such as airframes and the industry is branching to other MRO segments such as engines in collaboration with global OEMs. After the announcement of the National Civil Aviation Policy (NCAP2016), the number of MROs in India has increased to 147, from 114 in 2016. The setting up of new MROs has increased employment in the sector . More airports are building MRO facilities to add capacity thereby addressing infrastructure constraints.\n\nOutlook : The number of airports in India has more than doubled since 2014. However, there is  need to augment this capacity by adding more airports as well as expansion/upgradation of existing airports in the next five years. In spite of impressive growth in the last decade in the Indian aviation market, there is still largely untapped potential. At around 0.13 air trips per capita 12 , the current passenger air traffic is a fraction of India's potential. MRO and skill development will fuel the growth of the sector further. Initiatives such as the International Aviation  Hub  Strategy  and  engagements  with  global  bodies  signal  India's  intent  to  emerge as  a  key  player  in  the  global  aviation  landscape.  For  India  to  take  a  leadership  position  in aviation, focus is required on improving the efficiency and viability of airlines while ensuring environmental sustainability. A large proportion of Indian international traffic for the long\n\n12    Ministry of Civil Aviation\n\nhaul goes through connectivity hubs in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. There is also need to provide adequate long-haul connectivity from India by strengthening Indian airlines.\n\n## Energy Infrastructure\n\n## Power Sector\n\n12.34.  Power transmission in India is connected into one grid running on one frequency with the inter-regional capability of transferring 1,18,740 megawatts (MW). It is emerging as one of the largest unified electricity grids in the world. Until 31 March 2024, transmission systems have expanded to 4,85,544 circuit kilometre of transmission lines and 12,51,080 mega volt amp (MVA) of transformation capacity.\n\n12.35.  The peak electricity demand increased by 13 per cent to 243 GW in FY24. The Government of  India  has  accelerated  its  efforts  to  enhance  the  sector  and  meet  the  continuously  rising demand for electricity in the country. Between FY23 and FY24, the maximum rise in electricity generation was recorded in renewable energy resources for utilities.\n\n## Box XII. 8: Revamped distribution sector scheme (RDSS)\n\nRDSS was launched in 2021 to help distribution companies improve operational efficiencies and  financial  sustainability  by  providing  result-linked  financial  assistance  to  strengthen supply infrastructure based on meeting pre-qualifying criteria and achieving basic minimum benchmarks.\n\n- RDSS has an outlay of around ₹3.04 lakh crore from FY22 to FY26 13  which includes an estimated Government budgetary support of around ₹0.98 lakh crore.\n- RDSS aims  to  reduce  aggregate  technical  &amp;  commercial  losses  to  12-15  per  cent  by FY25 14 , reduce the Average Cost of Supply and the Average Revenue Realized gap to zero by FY25 and improve quality, reliability, and affordability of power supply to consumers through a financially sustainable and operationally efficient distribution sector.\n- Under RDSS, 19.79 crore prepaid smart meters, 52 lakh distribution transformer meters and 1.88 lakh feeder meters have been sanctioned.\n\n12.36.  A total of 2.86 crore households have been electrified since the launch of the Saubhagya period in October 2017 under various schemes. Further, the implementation of Electricity (late payment surcharge and related matters) Rules, 2022 have given relief to the DISCOMs, as well as electricity consumers and generating companies. Since implementation, as of 2 nd  April 2024, total bills amounting to ₹8.1 lakh crore have been settled against the total billed amount of ₹8.7 lakh crore from May 2022 (excluding EMI Payments against legacy dues and including disputed invoices).\n\n13 PIB dated 11 Aug 2023, Ministry of Power - https://tinyurl.com/yc6e8wev\n\n14 PIB dated 11 Aug 2023, Ministry of Power - https://tinyurl.com/yc6e8wev\n\n| Box XII. 9: Some Key Initiatives in the Power Sector                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Box XII. 9: Some Key Initiatives in the Power Sector                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| SAMARTH Mission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | One Sun, One World, One Grid Initiative                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ● Launched in 2021, the Sustainable Agrarian Mission on Use of Agri- Residue in Thermal Power Plant (SAMARTH) has a full-time mission directorate to coordinate and monitor implementation. ● Biomass co-firinginNCRthermalpower plants has reached 1.68 per cent; efforts are underway to take it up to 5 per cent.                                                                                                                                                                     | ● A task force is studying the feasibility of interconnection of regional grids viz.
