Globally,  India's  services  exports constituted 4.4 per cent of the world's commercial services exports in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n11.6 The contribution of the services sector to the overall GVA has increased significantly in the last decade. The sector's share dropped in FY21 due to the pandemic-induced contraction. However, as shown in Chart XI.3, the sector's share has almost recovered to the pre-COVID levels.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: National Accounts Statistics (NAS), MoSPI\n\nNote: Estimates for FY23 are First Revised Estimates, and for FY24 are Provisional Estimates.\n\n11.7 For a decade before COVID, the services sector's real growth rate consistently exceeded the overall economic growth. However, in FY21, the services sector saw a sharper contraction of 8.4 per cent compared to a 4.1 per cent decline in overall GVA. Non-contact intensive services, primarily  financial,  information  technology  and  professional  services,  experienced  positive and steady growth due to fewer disruptions and increased demand for digital services. The contraction was concentrated in contact-intensive services due to lockdowns, restricted travel, and reduced demand for hospitality, entertainment, and personal services due to preventive measures. As the restrictions  were  lifted,  these  sectors  rebounded,  aided  by  the  supportive policy environment. Hence, post-COVID, the services sector's growth outpaced overall GVA growth in FY23 and FY24, reclaiming its role in driving the economy's upward trajectory.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n11.8 As per the Provisional Estimates, the services sector is estimated to have grown 7.6 per cent  in  FY24.  Various  high-frequency  indicators  support  the  services  sector's  growth  story. Both  GST  collections  and  the  issuance  of  e-way  bills,  reflecting  wholesale  and  retail  trade, demonstrated a double-digit growth. The gross GST collection reached ₹20.18 lakh crore 2 in FY24, marking 11.7 per cent increase from the previous year, underscoring robust domestic trading activity. Average daily electronic toll collection, total air passengers handled, and rail freight traffic registered a YoY growth of 18.9 per cent, 15 per cent and 5.3 per cent, respectively, in  FY24,  supporting  the  steady  growth  of  transportation  services.  However,  there  is  some catching  up  left  to  be  achieved  in  the  pre  pandemic  trend  in  the  levels  of  trade,  hotel  and transport sector, as pointed out in Box I.1 of Chapter 1 of this Survey. Bank credit and deposits expanded YoY by 20.2 per cent and 12.9 per cent, respectively, as of March 2024, suggesting continued buoyancy in financial services. The residential property market also demonstrated a promising trend in 2023, with demand and new supply experiencing double-digit growth. 3\n\n## Box XI.1: The services sector continues to command the highest share in the number of registered companies\n\nA total number of 16,91,495 active companies exist in India as of 31 March 2024. The services sector has the highest number of active companies (65 per cent). Within the services sector, business services has the highest number of active companies (28 per cent), followed by trading (13 per cent) and community, personal and social services (11 per cent). In FY24 alone, 1,85,312 new companies were registered, out of which 71 per cent were services sector companies. 4\n\n## Chart XI.5: Economic activity-wise distribution of active companies (as of 31 March 2024)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource: Monthly Information Bulletin (March 2024), Ministry of Corporate Affairs\n\nNote: CP&amp;S - Community, Personal and Social Services, Agri &amp; Allied - Agriculture and Allied Activities, RE&amp;R Real Estate and Renting, TS&amp;C - Transport, Storage and Communications, EG&amp;WS - Electricity, Gas and Water Supply Companies, M&amp;Q - Mining and Quarrying.

The  rapid  formalisation of the services sector, increased demand for digital, financial, and entertainment services, integration into the global supply chain, and the availability of skilled professionals for startups are driving the sector's growth in the economy.\n\n## Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)- Services\n\n11.9 Business activity in the services sector in India transcended the obstacles of the pandemic and  other  disruptions  worldwide.  The  sector  picked  up  significantly  from  April  2023  and remained resilient throughout the financial year. HSBC's India Services Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) 5  is a widely used high-frequency indicator that supports the overall services sector growth narrative. In March 2024, services PMI soared to 61.2, marking one of the sector's most significant sales and business activity expansions in nearly 14 years.  This was primarily attributed to the latest upturn in business activity due to healthy demand conditions, efficiency gains and positive sales developments. PMI services averaged 60.3 in FY24 for the entire year compared to 57.3 in FY23. 6  As can be seen from Chart XI.6, the services PMI has remained above 50 since August 2021, implying continuous expansion for the last 35 months. The sector has continued to expand amidst dynamic market conditions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Compiled from various monthly HSBC India Services PMI reports\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\nNote: The index varies between 0 and 100, with a reading above 50 indicating an overall increase compared to the previous month and below 50, an overall decrease.\n\n5    The services PMI include consumer (excluding retail), transport, information, communication, finance, insurance, real estate, and business services.\n\n6    S&amp;P Global (04  April  2024).

Post-pandemic, services exports have maintained a steady momentum and accounted for 44 per cent of India's total exports in FY24.\n\n11.11 The weakening of global trade weighed down India's services exports during FY24, with a deceleration in growth to 4.8 per cent from 27.8 per cent a year ago. However, India ranked fifth 7  in services exports, with other countries being the European Union (excluding intra-EU trade), the United States, the United Kingdom, and China. Computer services and business services exports accounted for about 73 per cent of India's services exports and witnessed a 9.6 per cent growth YoY in FY24. The export of travel services experienced a significant growth of  24.6  per  cent  YoY,  benefitting  from  the  continued  recovery  in  tourism  post-pandemic restrictions.  On  the  contrary,  transportation  receipts  declined  by  19.1  per  cent,  primarily induced by a decrease in global freight rates, also reflected by a decline in the average Baltic Dry Index. 8 , which decreased by 3.9 per cent on a YoY basis during FY24.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource: RBI Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy (Table No.196 - India's Overall Balance of PaymentsQuarterly- US Dollars)\n\nNote: Other services not presented in the chart include- Insurance, Government not included elsewhere (G.n.i.e), Miscellaneous, financial and communication services.\n\n11.12 Recently, the growth in the 'other business services' segment has been primarily driven by  sectors  such  as  business  and  management  consultancy,  public  relations,  engineering services, advertising, trade fair services and other technical services, including scientific and space services.

As many of these commodities are raw materials that go into the production of  finished goods, the BDI is often considered an indicator of economic growth and production. The index is maintained by the London-based Baltic Exchange.\n\nCentres (GCCs) by multinational corporations seeking efficiency gains and reduced business costs  has  significantly  boosted  software  and  business  services  exports.  Over  the  years,  the share of travel and business services has increased while transportation has marginally fallen. Furthermore, the pandemic has catalysed a structural shift in global demand towards digitally delivered services. Consequently, India's share in digitally delivered services exports globally increased to 6.0 per cent in 2023 from 4.4 per cent in 2019. 9\n\n11.13 During FY24, services imports stood at USD 178.3 billion, a 2.1 per cent decrease on a YoY basis, dragged down by a reduction of global freight rates. The rise in services exports, coupled with a fall in imports, led to an increase in net services receipts on a YoY basis during FY24, which helped cushion India's current account deficit.",
