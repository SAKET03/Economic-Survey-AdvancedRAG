  "content": "Chapter 13 Summary:\nThe chapter discusses the issue of climate change and India's approach to addressing it. The author argues that the current global approach to climate change is flawed and that India needs to follow its own path to address the problem. The chapter highlights India's achievements in reducing emission intensity and increasing non-fossil fuel-based electric capacity. It also discusses the need for a sustainable lifestyle and the importance of individual actions in addressing climate change. The author introduces the concept of Mission LiFE, a unique initiative announced by the Prime Minister of India to bring individual responsibility to the forefront of the fight against climate change. The chapter also discusses the global pursuit of energy-guzzling technologies and the need for a collective policy reflective of individual pro-planet choices. The author emphasizes the importance of public policy and not the market in undertaking the 'right' decision. The chapter concludes by highlighting the need for a philosophical shift in understanding life and the importance of mindful consumption of resources.\n\nSubchapter 3 Content:\n# Why is the Current Approach Flawed?\n\n## WHY IS THE CURRENT APPROACH FLAWED?\n\n13.7.  To inform the design of emission-limiting pathways, IPCC has quantified the remaining carbon space available as the 'carbon budget.' As per their estimates, from the beginning of 2020, the world has approximately 500 GtCO2 left for a target of 1.5°C and 1150 GtCO2 for a target of 2°C (with a likelihood of 50% and 67%, respectively). With each passing year, the budget gets smaller, and the time available to act slips away. Nations are then expected to commit to ' accelerated and equitable mitigation pathways '  while walking the tightrope of developmental demands. The alarmism sounds quite dreadful, with the IPCC stating, ' there is  a  rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future for\n\n4    The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assessment Report (IPCC AR6) states, 'Human-caused climate  change  is  already  affecting  many  weather  and  climate  extremes.  This  has  led  to  widespread  adverse impacts on food and water security, human health and on economies and society'. The half-life of CO2 and a stock of the damage already caused has thus given rise to a need for collective action if we are to limit temperature rises and the consequent environmental damage.\n\n5    The Atmosphere: Getting a Handle on Carbon Dioxide, Alan Buis, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, October 2019 (https://tinyurl.com/4hjfzxev)\n\nall '.  Such forebodings notwithstanding, the purported climate solution has some fundamental issues.\n\n## Little principled understanding of laws of Life\n\n13.8. Life exists only in the form as we know it today. Hence, any strategy that aims to confuse man-made  actions  as  entire  solutions  by  themselves  is  extremely  short-sighted  in  nature. Ultimately, we cannot ignore the reality that we come from nature, and the systems required for life must necessarily be linked to the organic flow of nature and life. No artificial mechanism is  a  workable  system  in  its  entirety  because  as  much  as  we  can  ingeniously  tinker  with manufacturing processes, two simple principles stand paramount- 1) Humans cannot create a new element, cannot change any law of nature, and cannot synthesise a process that doesn't take or release to the environment. 2) Fundamentals of existence remain the same eternally. This means humans will continue to want oxygen, water, and food in the form we know it. Yet, we continue to disrupt the same for both us and other species. That's why the adopted strategy for addressing climate change suffers from foundational issues.\n\n13.9. Climate  change  strategies  continue  to  be  prescriptive  in  the  acceptable  mandates  for geographically,  economically,  and  climatically  different  countries.  Without  cross-learning, many  natural  ideas  relevant  to  sustainable  development,  such  as  consumption  patterns, lifestyles, plant vs meat-based diet, etc., are not factored in.\n\n13.10. Globally,  Power  and  Transport  industries  have  the  maximum  contribution  to  GHG emissions, followed by Industrial combustion, Agriculture, and Waste industries. Of the latter, Beef production has the highest emissions per kilogram of food product as seen in Tab XIII.1. Despite this, there is not even a call for change, let alone a mandate.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource:  Poore,  J.,  &amp;  Nemecek,  T.  (2018).  Reducing  food's  environmental  impacts  through  producers  and consumers. Science, 360(6392), 987-992.- processed by Our World in Data (https://tinyurl.com/3xja4ajs)\n\n13.11.  The entire developed world uses toilet paper made of 'virgin wood' for the most regular body activity, every single day, multiple times over. One of the best global sustainability blogs 'TreeHugger' states that 'Making one single roll of toilet paper uses 1.5 pounds of wood 6 , 37 gallons  of  water  and  1.3  kWh  of  electricity.  Many  Asian  countries  provide  valuable  lessons around these, yet their non-capitalist strategies often remain excluded from mainstream discussions because Behavioural and Lifestyle Change seems to be more difficult than Climate Change.\n\n13.12. Man, and Nature (gross forms of Purush and Prakriti in the Samkhya Tradition) are indestructible entities that interact to provide meaning to consciousness in the form of reality as we know it. Hence, any strategy that aims to alter things far beyond the comprehension or control of man, such as ensuring that the planet's temperature doesn't cross 2 degrees Celsius, must travel the journey inwards and not outwards.\n\n## Ignores the interconnected nature of existence\n\n13.13. Climate is nature's reality so inherently interconnected in ways that science hasn't even discovered its nuances. Surprisingly, our accepted pathways seem to ignore this unmissable reality to focus on siloed solutions, unintegrated with natural value chains. A case in point is the substitution of energy - to renewables from fossil fuels.\n\n13.14. There  is  hardly  any  inequivalence  foundationally  between  extracting  earth  for  one resource over another. Solar panels may generate renewable energy, but solar batteries are formed of materials extracted from the earth's crust 7 , particularly Lithium, Cobalt, Nickel, and some rare earth minerals 8 .  According to some estimates 9 , this not only leaves 'large scars in the landscape' but requires substantial water, releasing about 15 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of mineral 10 . Bringing the extracted ore to usable forms requires heat between 800-1000 degrees Celsius 11 ,  temperatures  that  can,  ironically,  be  cost-effectively  brought  out  by  only  burning fossil fuels (Chart XIII.2).\n\n13.15. Cobalt and Copper, used extensively in Li-ion batteries, electric vehicles, and mobile phones, have a raging sustainability crisis at the heart of their extraction. About four-fifths of the world's cobalt supply is buried deep within a single country that is also one of the world's poorest - the Democratic Republic of Congo (hereafter referred to as Congo). About 80% of the country's cobalt production is controlled by Chinese companies who refine in China, and subsequently sell to battery manufacturers globally. Siddharth Kara, a fellow at Harvard's T.H Chan School of Public Health, states in his book 'Cobalt Red' that much of Congo's Cobalt extraction is done by 'artisanal miners'' - a new-age euphemistic term for freelance workers\n\n6  Stop Using Toiler Paper; Get the Blue Bidet, Treehugger, October 2018 (https://tinyurl.com/3rmjz8kn)\n\n7    Most of the minerals extracted are from hard rock mines or underground brine reservoirs through a process that requires energy generated from CO2-emitting fossil fuels.\n\n8    Some of the magnets used in their production comprise rare earth minerals like neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) and samarium cobalt (SmCo). They are not 'rare' in the actual sense of the word but abundant in the earth's crust. However, since they occur in relatively low concentrations in the ores compared to other normally extractable metals, they pose significant difficulty in mining and refining, which again does huge damage to the environment.\n\n9   The new 'gold rush' for green lithium, BBC, November 2020 (https://tinyurl.com/mrjsuw9w).\n\n10  Analysis by raw materials experts Minviro for the lithium and geothermal energy firm Vulcan Energy Resources.\n\n11    How much CO2 is emitted by manufacturing batteries?, MIT Climate Portal, March 2022 (https://tinyurl.com/ pvbxkx44).\n\nwho work in dangerous mines for the equivalent of few dollars a day 12 . It is sad and ironical that all of this is done in the name of sustainable electric vehicles, which may contain up to 3.5 times as much copper as a gas powered cars 13 .\n\nSource: J.P. Morgan Global Energy Strategy: The Energy Transition (April 2024), Figure 8: Energy Intensity of transition, Page 6\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n13.16. The generative value chain of 'clean energy' products such as solar panels and windmills, stretching from mining to manufacturing to transportation to use to the last stage of disposal, has similar emission effects as other fuels would, depending on material and distances travelled. Additionally,  it  consists  of  the  disruption  of  existing  supply  chains  made  over  decades  and creating new pathways involving monumental environmental externalities such as emissions during  extraction,  transportation,  the  establishment  of  new  factories  involving  new  land, machinery production, and ancillary development, transportation of mobile renewable units to individual consumers, rendering existing infrastructure and pathways redundant.\n\n13.17. For example - switching to EVs requires uprooting the existing network of petrol pumps and creating a new network of charging stations involving all of the above. Unfortunately, all of  these  'hidden costs' - both from a monetary, and an environmental perspective are not accounted for in the lifecycle costs when advocating for the displacement of fossil fuels with renewable  options.  Their  greatest  'climate-friendly'  emission  control  rests  only  in  end-user emissions, which makes the comparison of climate costs across the options incomparable.\n\n13.18. There is not enough research on how much the end-to-end lifecycle costs. Land is finite, but demand is not. Solar can need 300 times as much space as nuclear, and biomass more than 8,000 times 14 . At the same time, wind turbine blades and solar panels have to be replaced every couple of decades, resulting in potentially enormous waste problems. Apart from space and\n\n12    How 'modern-day slavery' in the Congo powers the rechargeable battery economy, NPR, February 2023 (https:// tinyurl.com/28nuum3e).\n\n13    In  Congo's  Cobalt  Mines,  Nicolas  Niarchos,  The  New  York  Review,  December  2023  (https://tinyurl.com/ tfphf988).\n\n14    Climate action: Our energy transition need not follow preset pathways, V. Anantha Nageswaran &amp; Bjorn Lomborg, 21st February 2024 (https://tinyurl.com/5bv5272t)\n\nwaste issues, the main challenge preventing swift transition is that solar and wind power are only cheaper than fossil fuels when the sun shines and the wind blows. Industrialisation and development require power and energy 24/7. Even factoring in four hours of storage makes solar and wind go from the cheapest power available to much more expensive than gas and coal power (Chart XIII.3).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n13.19. Moreover, to provide firmly reliable power, studies 15  show that a 100% solar and wind system would need a large storage capacity, which is impossibly expensive. Overall, there are critical sustainability issues connected to the production of wind turbines, solar photovoltaic modules,  electric  vehicles,  and  lithium-ion  batteries,  such  as  the  use  of  conflict  minerals, toxicity, limited availability or supply chain governance issues of rare earth elements, cobalt &amp; lithium 16 . What the strategy excludes is indeed as noteworthy as what it includes.\n\n## Insufficient for the ordained purpose\n\n13.20.  In normal parlance, energy and power are often used interchangeably. However, their difference is another factor that makes climate change strategy a difficult one to follow. Matthew L Wald, an independent energy analyst, says in 'The Myth of Solar Power':\n\n'In November 2022, France passed a law requiring that all parking lots with 80 spaces or more install roofs with solar panels to cover at least half the spaces. According to estimates, the initiative will result in 11 GW of power-an amount, Grist gleefully reported, that would be enough to power 8 million homes. In fact, it's enough to power zero homes.\n\nIf  you  have  a  small  rooftop  solar  panel  that  can  generate  50  watts  of  power,  it  wouldn't matter how long the generator runs for or how much energy it produces and stores-on a\n\n15    Fekete, B.

Vaclav Smil goes so far as to say in a 48-page report 17  published by Fraser Institute, ' Net Zero Carbon is a highly unlikely outcome '.\n\n'In terms of final energy uses and specific energy converters, the unfolding transition would have to replace more than 4 terawatts (TW) of electricity-generating capacity now installed in  large  coal-  and  gas-fired  stations  by  converting  to  non-carbon  sources;  to  substitute nearly 1.5 billion combustion (gasoline and diesel) engines in road and off-road vehicles; to convert all agricultural and crop processing machinery (including about 50 million tractors and more than 100 million irrigation pumps); to find new sources of heat, hot air, and hot water used in a wide variety of industrial processes (from iron smelting and cement and glass making to chemical syntheses and food preservation) that now consume close to 30 percent of all final uses of fossil fuels; to replace more than half a billion natural gas furnaces now heating houses and industrial, institutional, and commercial places with heat pumps or other sources of heat; and to find new ways to power nearly 120,000 merchant fleet vessels (bulk carriers of ores, cement, fertilizers, wood and grain, and container ships, the largest one with capacities of some 24,000 units, now running mostly on heavy fuel oil and diesel fuel) and nearly 25,000 active jetliners that form the foundation of global long-distance transportation (fuelled by kerosene)... On the face of it, and even without performing any informed technical and economic analyses, this seems to be an impossible task given that:\n\n- We have only a single generation (about 25 years) to do it;\n- We have not even reached the peak of global consumption of fossil fuels;\n- The peak will not be followed by precipitous declines;\n- We still have not deployed any zero-carbon large-scale commercial processes to produce essential materials;\n- The electrification has, at the end of 2022, converted only about 2 per cent of passenger vehicles (more than 40 million) to different varieties of battery-powered cars, and that decarbonisation is yet to affect heavy road transport, shipping, and flying .\n\n## Earth has enough for needs but not for greed\n\n13.22.  The current Climate Change strategy seems to say that given that our energy needs will continue to rise, we must try replacing conventional fuel with renewables and clean energy thus making it a substitution issue rather than a global lifestyle issue. This replacement must be done only in the way we know - through swapping of one preferred industry to another, through the creation of new transportation and supply lines in place of existing ones, to penalising the low-emitters with disproportionately higher payments.\n\n13.23.  What this strategy doesn't do is attack the root of the problem - overconsumption, which is  starker  among  developed  countries.  Moreover,  do  each  of  us  really  need  multiple screens,  even  if  they  are  charged  by  renewable  energy  sources,  or  must  everyone  fly  off  to\n\n17  Halfway Between Kyoto and 2050: Net Zero Carbon is a Highly Unlikely Outcome, Fraser Institute, May 2024.\n\na  fancy  destination  in  fancy  planes  for  a  great  conversation  on  reducing  climate  impact,  or that we must eat for taste what we shouldn't eat for health or environment.  As Derek Bower says in FT 18 , ' If we want oil companies to stop selling fossil fuels, we should consume less of them and we should vote for governments that make them more expensive, not less. Yes, our physical infrastructure has been built over decades around petroleum use. Yes, oil companies have lobbied forever to preserve this arrangement and slow down alternatives. But no one is compelling those of us in the rich world to fly so much, drive Escalades, devour so much meat, or buy so much stuff .'\n\n13.24.  It  doesn't  encourage  a  genuine  cathartic  approach  to  nature  but  instead  focuses  on creating  another  industry  out  of  sustainability  -  instead  of  imbibing  sustainable  practices in the way we live, we worry more about carrying PETA labels on our bags. The fact of the matter is organisations, people, and countries are less bothered about ensuring virtuosity in the process of production than about getting a 'Fair Trade' global label in the fear of being shut out of premium places. This exclusive club does not question the drive towards overconsumption - more energy, more video entertainment, more houses, more transportation but questions the labels under which this happens. That is the hypocrisy in-built under the modern climate change strategy.\n\n## Global pursuit of energy-guzzling technologies\n\n13.25. On  the  one  hand,  developing  nations  are  forcefully  nudged  to  sign  up  for  climate commitments that they are not ready for. On the other hand, the developed world is in a mad 'Scramble for Africa' kind of rush to usher in the latest and the most expansive AI (Artificial Intelligence) ecosystem. The fact is that AI is an energy guzzler. Even as the data centres are ramping up energy demand, cloud storage facilities, crypto mining, and AI are all expected to increase this exponentially (Chart XIII.4).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Financial Times (https://tinyurl.com/4teb29ck); S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights *Includes cryptocurrency mining and manufacturing facilities and electrification of oil and gas operations\n\n18    The  Energy  Transition  will  be  volatile,  Financial  Times,  accessed  on  25th  June  2024  (https://tinyurl. com/52syuz7j).\n\n13.26.  As per a broad estimate by the International Energy Agency, a single Chat-GPT search consumes 10 times more energy than a similar query on Google. One large data centre in Iowa owned by Meta is estimated to burn just in one year, the equivalent of 7 million laptops working 8 hours a day 19 .  FT reports that power demand from data centres globally could reach up to 1,000 TWh by 2026 (Chart XIII.4). To put this figure in perspective - Germany's and France's net power demand today is roughly around 500 TWh each respectively 20 . Elon Musk, most famously said recently at Bosch Connected World Conference, ' I've never seen any technology advance faster than this. The chip shortage may be behind us, but AI and EVs are expanding at such a rapacious rate that the world will face supply crunches in electricity and transformers next year '. By 2034, global energy consumption by data centres is expected to top 1,580 TWh, about as much as is used by all of India 21 .\n\n13.27. This electricity demand is rising more exponentially than green energy production can keep pace with. Already, there seems to be a movement to push away green commitments and delay retiring of some coal-fired plants - in the Salt Lake City region, a coal plant retirement has been pushed back by a decade to 2042 and another delayed to 2036. While there are talks by tech leaders of attempting nuclear fusion startups to power the tech's Bakasur 22 -like hunger, practically, it seems to be much farther away in the future, given that the solution is not yet viable.\n\n13.28.  The incompatibility of the two major movements of AI and Green energy being pushed by the West is not unseen by the global world. It seems like little thought has been put into the inevitable discordance in the chosen economic and sustainable strategies.\n\n## Pretends to be data-driven but is shy of per-person data\n\n13.29.  It is said that India is the 3rd largest emitter after the US and China and, therefore, is repeatedly asked to accept a greater share of responsibility.  What is constantly de-emphasised is that since the period of the first settlement of societies, western nations with a forward position on the industrial revolution indulged in fossil-fuelled development with reckless abandon that led to the position the world is in today.  Despite advocacy by developing nations on this, a sanitised reference to 'historical emissions' is submerged deep within abstruse literature and is met with a casual indifference towards its real role and impact on the emerging countries' climate targets.  Even copious amounts of data inundation cannot change a basic fact: energy is a per-capita phenomenon. To put it simply:\n\nEnergy Consumption (at time T) = Energy consumed by 1 person (E1) * Number of people (N) + Energy consumed by common activities required for N (EN)\n\n19  AI is exhausting the power grid. Tech firms are seeking a miracle solution, The Washington Post, June 2024.\n\n20    Statistisches Bundesamt Gross Electricity Production in Germany and RTE France Electricity Analysis and Data, Accessed on 8th July, 2024.\n\n21  AI is already wreaking havoc on global power systems, Bloomberg, June 2024 (https://tinyurl.com/56494s6a).\n\n22    Bakasur is a figure from Indian Mythology, symbolizing limitless hunger and greed. The demon would force the king of the city to send him an unending supply of food every day, which he promptly devoured along with the people who delivered it to him.\n\n13.30.   Because all modern policy-making starts from baseline assessment, it is essential that the climate target for each country is proportional to its economic status. On the contrary, it is  observed that the top 10% of the per-capita emitters averaged 22 tonnes of CO2 in 2021, which is over 200 times what the bottom 10 % emits 23 . 85% of the current largest emitters live in advanced economies like the US, Europe, and China, and the bottom 10% of emitters live in developing countries of Africa and South Asia where even access to electricity is a challenge 24 . Illustrating  this  stark  difference  in  per-capita  consumption  and  emissions,  the  Economist highlights that the average African consumes 185 kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year while Europe and the United States consume 6500 kWh and 12700 kWh, respectively 25 . On the contrary, India's historical cumulative emissions and per capita emissions are very low despite being home to more than 17% of the global population - contributing only about 4% of the global cumulative greenhouse gas emissions between 1850 and 2019 (Chart XIII.5).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource:  EDGAR  (Emissions  Database  for  Global  Atmospheric  Research)  Community  GHG  Database,  a collaboration between the European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC), the International Energy Agency (IEA),  and  comprising  IEA-EDGAR  CO2,  EDGAR  CH4,  EDGAR  N2O,  EDGAR  F-GASES  version  8.0,  (2023) European Commission, JRC (Datasets)\n\n13.31. In this wonderland, Alice would have remarked, ' Curiouser and Curiouser ' - for even though  global  comparison  of  countries  uses  data  such  as  per-capita  income  or  per-capita consumption, the same is not followed while assessing energy emissions, even when it is directly dependent  on  per-person  use.  Countries  assumed  to  be  'greener'  by  various  international indices turn a dark shade of brown when the filter of per capita is applied.\n\n23    The world's top 1% of emitters produce over 1000 times more CO2 than the bottom 1%, IEA, February 2023 (https://tinyurl.com/bdtf4tda)\n\n24    IEA estimates state that as of 2022, approximately 774 million people lacked access to electricity, with more\n\nthan 80 per cent of them living in Sub-Saharan Africa; Data &amp; Statistics - IEA (https://tinyurl.com/4atwv4d2). 25  Africa will remain poor unless it uses more energy, Published in The Economist (https://tinyurl.com/yzpkzecm).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: The Green Future Index 2023, MIT Technology Review Insights and EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) Community GHG Database\n\n13.32.  Comparatively, India's per capita emissions have consistently remained low between 2.5 and 2.8 Tons CO2eq/ year, despite substantial economic growth over the last decade. Per capita emissions of EU27 nations (8 Tons CO2eq/ year) 26  were almost 3 times that of India. Even in the three scenarios for demand estimation employed by World Energy Outlook 2023, it was reported that the ' per-capita energy demand of emerging countries remains well below that of developed countries, even by 2030' 27 . A point that casually falls through the crevices in the discussions around climate change.\n\n13.33.  With such extreme disparities and large and persistent inequalities in historical and current  global  energy  consumption,  the  targets  and  strategies  for  the  attainment  of  zero emissions should not be dictated or mandated. It is important for countries to take ownership of  the  climate  problem  and  work  through  a  collaborative  approach  for  meaningful  climate action, unencumbered by external pressure or excessive criticism.\n\n## Historical Blindspot and a surprising lack of Guilt\n\n13.34.  Globally, there seems to be a tendency to overburden oneself with the need to set right today, the wrongs of the past. This is also complemented by a moralistic angle taken by the developed world on governance and policy towards countries with different understandings, including sustainability. However, in the case of climate change, where the data is as clear as\n\n26  Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research, GHG Emissions of all world countries 2023 Report\n\n27    'Global energy demand per capita is around 80 gigajoules (GJ) today, a level that has remained broadly stable over the last decade (Figure 3.3). It remains stable in the STEPS (Stated Policies Scenario) to 2030, but it declines by 7% in the APS (Announced Pledges Scenario) and by 15% in the NZE (Net Zero Emissions) Scenario. In advanced economies, per capita demand declines in all scenarios to 2030. In emerging market and developing economies, it continues to rise in the STEPS as economic growth drives an increase in energy services demand.' IEA World Energy Outlook 2023, Figure 3.3: Energy intensity and energy per capita in selected regions in the Stated Policies and Announced Pledges scenarios, 2022 and 2030.\n\nchalk and cheese, the origin of the problem and the actual privilege enjoyed for a large number of decades (exploiting resources with a gay abandon to achieve economic progress) are also ignored. As Alice says in her Wonderland 28 , ' But that's just the trouble with me. I give myself very good advice, but I very seldom follow it .''\n\n13.35.  A significant disparity in energy access and carbon footprints can be observed among developed and developing countries. While developed nations have built their infrastructure at a leisurely, uninterrupted pace, many countries in Africa and South Asia are still striving to  achieve  regular  electricity  supply  in  urban  areas.  About  55  per  cent  of  the  population  in least-developed countries still lack access to electricity 29 .  Research alludes that high-income countries use 6 times more resources and generate 10 times larger climate impacts than lowincome countries. 30  This disparity makes it unfair to have a single deadline for zero emissions across countries.\n\n13.36.  Low-  and  middle-income  countries  face  triple  threats  in  terms  of  increasing  energy demand,  unaffordable  costs  of  clean  technologies,  and  a  deep  dependence  on  fossil  fuels. This calls for a genuine recognition by developed nations of their historical contribution to environmental degradation and transfer of resources, technology, as well as technical capacity to developing countries which helps in closing the financing gap and progressing towards the shared goal of combating climate change.\n\n## Inadequate climate financing\n\n13.37. The West turns a March Hare 31  I have an excellent idea! Let's change the subject -every time the subject of real climate financing due to historical reparations comes into play. Research shows that developing countries require ~USD 6 trillion by 2030 to achieve just about half of their existing NDC targets. Against this, only USD 100 billion was pledged by developed countries till 2020 32 , of which only USD 83.3 billion was provided 33 . This level of financing still does not match up to the scale of the challenge faced - climate adaptation needs of developing countries are expected to reach USD 300 billion by 2030 and USD 500 billion by 2050 34 , which is 5-10 times greater than the current fund flows.\n\n13.38.  Robert Burns in his poem says ' There is no such uncertainty as a sure thing '.  The surety of such climate pledges looks far more problematic once the lens is zoomed. Most of the current funding comprises loans to middle-income countries that are already struggling with heavy public debt burdens to meet their essential service requirements. Over two-thirds of the climate finance received by middle-income countries between 2015 and 2020 was in the form of loans 35 . Moreover, profits and returns on investments are often prioritised over long-term\n\n28  Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll.\n\n29    UNCTAD calculations based on data from the International Energy Agency and UNCTADstat (https://tinyurl. com/53cxcstz).\n\n30  Global Resources Outlook 2024, UNEP.\n\n31  Alice in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll\n\n- 32   A climate finance goal that works for developing countries, UNCTAD, June 2023 (https://tinyurl.com/2vpxe86k).\n- 33    Climate Finance and the USD 100 billion goal, OECD (https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/climate-finance-andthe-usd-100-billion-goal.html)\n\n34  UNEP Adaptation Gap Report 2020\n\n- 35    Climate finance programme funnelling billions of dollars back to rich countries, Frontline Research, May 2024 (https://tinyurl.com/ycyp7ybv)\n\nenvironmental sustainability during fund allocation.\n\n13.39.  They say the devil lies in the details. Under the golden wrapper of a committed USD100bn financing, the elves are at work polishing the quirks, as is evidenced in this small fact reported by Hindustan Times 36  - At the Cartagena Ad Hoc Work Programme (AHWP) talks - in the runup to the actual negotiations at the Conference of Parties (CoP) - the United States and other western countries have reportedly pushed to make the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) contributions 'voluntary' for those who 'choose to pay'. They have also advocated widening the pool of contributors to include developing nations based on the latter's 'economic realities' and 'current emission share'. So, the reason behind this vacillation on 'Who's to pay' is wellindicated through Box XIII.3.\n\n## Box XIII.3: Willingness to Change and Willingness to pay for Environmentally Sustainable Policies\n\nOne would imagine that given most of the climate sustainability debate largely stems from the developed world, they would be the first ones to accept the financial impact of changing their  consumption-oriented  lifestyle.  However,  research  says  otherwise.  Almost  63%  of respondents of the OECD Environmental Policies and Individual Behaviour Change Survey in 2022 (administered to over 17,000 households) feel that sustainable choices should not impact them financially and therefore 'they are unwilling to pay extra'. Contrast this directly with the CBAM tax that EU is willing to impose on products such as steel, for the so-called 'fair price on carbon emitted' during production, imported from developing countries.  In the same survey, ~43% of respondents reported regular consumption of red meat and showed resistance to changing this lifestyle attribute with a large impact on climate change. The analysis further indicates that households' general proclivity to the environment, does not influence their frequency of red meat consumption.\n\nAt this rate, the question seems less about sustainable choices, but more about a new play for capitalism. Having exhausted the extant industrial networks and saturation in product consumption, one can only create space for a whole new dynamic of industrial consumption - new industrial products, new markets, and new ways of taxing the ones still struggling to survive, so that the old status quo keeps thriving, and the 'emerging' are in a perpetual state of question.\n\n## ADOPTING THE WESTERN PRACTICES HAS NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DEVELOPING WORLD\n\n13.40.  With the largest population in the world, India has only the 7th largest area, culminating in  a  significant  resource  constraint.  And  yet  this  country  consistently  delivers  not  only  on sustaining its vast population but also on touching the pinnacles of an aspirational society. The authors would like to argue that a principal reason for this inherent ability of the country to be resilient to economic, social, and historical challenges, is its inherent 'Dharmic' nature that 36  Retrieved from Hindustan Times (https://tinyurl.com/2zpr2rfn)\n\nmakes it want to become an efficient Market Economy, but not a Market Society. The difference between the two was first described by Karl Polanyi, who described the two 37  as follows:\n\n'This  institutional  gadget,  which  became  the  dominant  force  in  the  economy-now justly  described  as  a  market  economy-then  gave  rise  to  yet  another,  even  more  extreme development, namely as a whole society embedded in the mechanism of its own economy-a market society.'\n\n13.41. Simply put, a market economy - dominating the world economy today- is centred on the notion that supply and demand drive the production of goods and services, and prices are derived from the 'invisible hand of free markets.' A market society is often the culmination of  a  long-standing  culture  of  market  economics,  whereby  the  social  mores  become  heavily permeated by market values, leading to the commodification of areas that were traditionally governed by non-market norms.\n\n13.42.  India is not only not a market society but also at its root, a unique society where our culture,  economy, societal norms, and environment are interlinked in a circuitous manner. As the forces foreign to us continue to shape our thought processes, India must be cautious in changing both lifestyle and user behaviour learning from societies different from ours, lest it impacts us in the future on 3Es - Equity, Environment, and Economics.\n\n13.43.  That market economics must not follow a universally-designed golden mean and must adapt to local conditions, is a point brought out well on several international platforms such as the 2005 and ensuing G20 declarations, the 2010-13 UN agreement that explicitly discarded One-Size-Fits-All (OSFA) and the 2015 Millennium Development Goals (Chart XIII.7).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n13.44.  It's  time  to  acknowledge  the  market  economy's  limitation  in  achieving  emissions mitigation. Market discipline exists in theory as seen in numerous financial market busts. The market mechanism is pro-cyclical. Hence, it foments instability rather than being a force for stability. It seldom rewards a 'good choice' principally, but always the good choice financially.\n\n37    For more description on the subject, the paper by Frank Cunningham serves as a revelationary read: http:// individual.utoronto.ca/frankcunningham/marketEco.pdf\n\n## The Meat Production Process and the destruction of the food-feed balance\n\n13.45. Meat, due to its calorie density, has played a catalytic role 38  in the evolution of humans and was an important source of nutrition until the development of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago. As societies settled and civilisations oriented around agriculture emerged in various parts of the world, the human race moved to a blend of plant- and animal-based cuisines over time. With time, improvements in agricultural research facilitated a significant expansion  of  the  available  plant-based  food  options,  which  are  rich  in  nutrients  and  offer significant health benefits. Agricultural research has made it so that today, if one chooses to do so, it is completely possible for a human to meet all the nutritional requirements of their body from an exclusively plant-based diet and live a long, healthy life.\n\n13.46.  However, since  the  preference  for  meat  is  part  of  our  evolutionary  process  and  our digestive systems being clearly selected for an omnivorous diet, meat remains an important part of the nutritional mix. As societies moved towards affluence, the quantity of meat demanded also rose. North America and Europe saw their meat production grow by 2.5 times and 1.7 times, respectively, between 1961 and 2000 39 . More important is the fact that increased production in these regions was facilitated by the emergence of the modern mass-scale feed industry, which now presents a credible and significant threat to food security around the globe.\n\n13.47.  The feed industry has emerged as such a massive undertaking that 33 per cent of the total arable land on the planet is now being utilised for feed crop production 40 , and new land being added through deforestation 41   or repurposing existing farmlands 42 . Further, the reliance on human-edible crops under the Western method of meat production has set into motion a food-feed competition 43  as more than one-third of the global cereal produced is utilised as animal feed. At the same time, one in ten humans still do not get enough to eat 44 .\n\n13.48.   A recent analysis published in 'Nature' highlighted that only 37 per cent of the harvested area of major crops is used for direct food consumption, 45  while a large share of the humanedible crops is now facing competing uses, primarily from the livestock industry. This is because 1  kilogram of beef requires 25 kilograms of feed crop while 1 kilogram of lamb requires 15 kilograms of feed crop 46 . Among the crops serving as the primary source of feed in the Western\n\n38    Despite  our  ancestors  being  'hunter-gatherers',  it  is  often  believed  that  foraged  plants  were  relied  upon  as fallback options when meat availability was scarce.\n\n39  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n40    Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\n41    Demand for meat is destroying the Amazon, The Washington Post, March 2022.

These five crops are among the ten global crops that provide 83 per cent of all harvested food calories 47 .\n\n13.49.  Furthermore, while croplands and crop yields have increased around the world, the proportion of crops being grown for food consumption has been declining since the 1960s (right around the time the feed industry began expanding in the West) 48 . For example, the United States, with its abundance of cropland, was once thought of as the 'food basket', but today, with the rampant appropriation of arable land for feed crops, it is more likely to be termed the 'feed basket.' 49 .\n\n## Chart XIII.8: Average fraction of harvest used for Direct food, feed, and processing (1964-1968)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Ray, D.

Similar trends have begun emerging in other developing nations adopting the Western methods of animal husbandry, as rampant deforestation and shifting agricultural  practices towards feed crop cultivation are presenting themselves as a major risk to food security in the  developing  world,  especially  with  projected  population  growth  trends.  By  2030,  many developing  countries  will  not  be  able  to  fulfil  the  calories  required  for  nourishment  of  the growing population due to the deficit in calories harvested as direct food crops 50 . Many nondirect food crops not grown in wealthy countries are grown in developing countries for export to wealthy countries to supplement Western-style diets (such as feed for the meat industry) 51 . This is grim since land is already scarce, and arable land is even more so.\n\n47    Tilman, D., Balzer, C., Hill, J., &amp; Befort, B. L. (2011).

This shortage of land is now leading to a land squeeze around the world, as just feeding the growing population would require an additional 600 million hectares (nearly twice the size of India) by 2050 52 . With more and more land being dedicated to growing animal feed rather than feeding each of the 828 million undernourished people affected by hunger 53 , is now not the time to arrest this trend? We should ponder for a minute to ask ourselves if this is really the best use of our scarce natural resources.\n\n13.52.  In addition to resource scarcity and food security threats looming over the horizon, the established methods of livestock cultivation are also highly unsustainable for the environment. Growing feed has been facilitated through industry standard practices such as monocropping, restricted crop rotation, incessant freshwater withdrawals 54 , excessive tillage, threatening local biodiversity 55 , and the application of synthetic pesticides and herbicides 56 . As one would expect, such practices are depleting farmland of its nutrients permanently, causing soil erosion and degrading the water quality 57 .\n\n13.53.  These practices cannot continue in the developed world. With the demand for meat expected to increase by 2050 due to rising incomes in the developing world, they definitely\n\n52  How to Manage the Global Land Squeeze?, World Resources Institute, July 2023\n\n53  State of Food Security and Nutrition 2022, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations\n\n54  Accounting for 8 per cent of Global human water use as highlighted by UNFAO\n\n55    Approximately  306  of  the  825  terrestrial  ecoregions  identified  by  the  Worldwide  Fund  for  Nature  (WWF) reported livestock as one of the major threats they face\n\n56    Poore, J., &amp; Nemecek, T. (2018). Reducing food's environmental impacts through producers and consumers. Science, 360(6392), 987-992.\n\n57    Livestock's Long Shadow: Environmental Issues and Options, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\ncannot adopt the same practices established by the Western feed industries. These concerns had already been elucidated 22 years ago by Gerbens-Leenes &amp; Nonhebel (2022) 58 . They stated, ' In Western countries, the influence of food consumption patterns on related land requirement is substantial, resulting in large regional as well as inter-generational differences…On a global scale, it should be realized that a large part of the population is undernourished…If patterns in developing countries shift towards the affluent menus of western countries, related per capita land requirements will rise substantially .' India is already among the largest producers of meat in the world. Adopting the same practices followed elsewhere would result in disastrous consequences for the environment and the people at large.\n\n13.54. Traditional  farming  practices  from  the  developing  world,  where  several  agricultural activities are integrated with livestock rearing, offer one solution to the problem. Taking the example  of  India,  our  agricultural  sector,  primarily  small  and  medium  farm  undertakings that engage in agriculture and livestock cultivation, has been practising sustainable farming for decades now (also called Integrated Farming System) 59 . By recycling farm waste and byproducts from other agricultural activities to serve as inputs for another activity (human inedible sources of feed such as grass and weeds plucked from fields, chaff and stubble collected postharvest, and other agro-waste), farming enterprises within India have been able to lower costs of production and enhance the productivity of their undertakings without upsetting the natural cycle. Similarly, the Integrated Farming Systems tested in African countries demonstrated that livestock-based integration not only helped the daily agricultural processes but also helped mitigate food security and malnutrition risks in humans as well as livestock 60 .\n\n13.55. Shifting livestock to human-inedible feed can free up significant shares of global arable land to address global hunger. More food crops can be directed towards human consumption and alleviate food security risks worldwide. While such a strategy has obvious climate change mitigation  benefits,  one  cannot  ignore  the  adaptation  benefits  this  strategy  offers,  too. Empowering farmers to reduce wastage and cultivate  multiple  income  streams  through  an integrated farming system would help make a stressed sector within most developing countries a significant employment generator.\n\n13.56.  How meat is cultivated will heavily influence the risks associated with food security and our environment. While it is utopian to assume that the world would abandon meat consumption altogether and take up a completely vegan diet, in this hypothetical scenario, doing so would reduce the total land requirements for agriculture from 4.1 billion hectares to 1 billion hectares\n\n58    Gerbens-Leenes, P. W., &amp; Nonhebel, S. (2002). Consumption patterns and their effects on land required for food. Ecological Economics, 42(1-2), 185-199.\n\n59    Shanmugam, P. M., Sangeetha, S. P., Prabu, P.

Can integrated livestockfish culture be a solution to East Africa's food insecurity? A review. African J. Food, Agric. Nutr. Dev. 13, 80588076. doi: 10.18697/ajfand.59.12920\n\n(an area the size of North America, plus Brazil) 61 . The purpose of this hypothetical is not to agonise over whether to eat meat or not but to demonstrate that many more efficient ways are available to feed the planet.\n\n13.57. Feeding an expected 10 billion people by 2050 is not trivial. Changes need to be brought about to the meat production processes without any delay, and the developing world should not only avoid emulating the environmentally and climatically unsustainable practices of the West but also point the way to the West, with its own food-feed balance practised for aeons.\n\n13.58.  To  reiterate,  a  better  food-feed  balance  will  only  need  a  fraction  of  the  land  that  is currently used for food production. The entire world can still be well-fed and leave more land for other purposes, such as renewable power generation. Instead, what we face is the danger or prospect that Western practices of cattle-rearing will spread to the rest of the world, just as  the  Western  obsession  with  Artificial  Intelligence  and  feeding  it  with  copious  quantities of data for it to become truly intelligent is consuming vast amounts of energy and water and upending energy generation plans in many countries. Developing countries are falling line, lest they fall behind in a chimeric race for technological competitiveness, unmindful of social and environmental consequences. The parallel cannot be any more uncanny than this.\n\n## Housing\n\n13.59.  As countries move towards economic development, one of the changes they experience is in the social fabric of society which in today's world, is a Western model of living, i.e., nucleated families and single-person residences. It is estimated 62   today that nearly 50 per cent of all households 63   in India are nuclear (1-4 members), up from 38 per cent in 2008. On average, a typical nuclear family in India had an average of 3 members vis-a-vis 7 in a joint family setup - nucleation rising in South India as opposed to North India. This is a major shift from our older societal norms of multi-generational living with Hindu undivided families (HUF) living under the same roof.  Chapter 8 of this survey on India's labour markets notes that a report by the United Nations Population Fund and the International Institute for Population Sciences emphasises the importance of elderly people living in multi-generational households. Indians did not really have to learn this from a United Nations report. It was part of our tradition. Naturally nucleated living gives rise to demand for additional housing units, smaller and more independent in nature. Given that the demand is only expected to double by 2050 64  and the sheer complexity involved due to urban areas in size ranging from over 15 million to a few thousand people as well as local vs new settlements, and different housing-building practices, India has a looming housing issue on the horizon.\n\n61    Hannah Ritchie (2021) - 'If the world adopted a plant-based diet, we would reduce global agricultural land use from 4 to 1 billion hectares' Published online at OurWorldInData.org. Retrieved from: (https://ourworldindata. org/land-use-diets).\n\n62  As per data from Kantar Worldwide in 2022.\n\n63  12.98 crore nuclear out of 24.88 crore households as per Census 2011.\n\n64  World Bank article (https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/urbandevelopment/overview)\n\n13.60.  Land, on the other hand, remains constricted, but aspirations are not so. Many highincome urban nucleated settlements give rise to the tendency of urban sprawl 65 , which is linked to higher energy consumption, elevated pollution levels, and increased traffic congestion causing significant negative environmental externalities 66 .  The correlation between household size and adverse impact on sustainability is being recognised all over the world. A 2021 research paper 67 says that the decrease in average household size in China over the past few decades is leading to  a  loss  of  scale  economies.  The  paper  further  states,  '' CO2 emission,  water  withdrawal, smoke ash emission, SO2 emission, NOx emission, and industrial wastewater discharge were found to increase with a smaller household size. For example, a household size reduction of 0.5 (to 2.5 members) by 2030-2035 could result in a 0.5% increase in CO2 emission and a 0.3% increase in water withdrawal as compared with the levels in 2015. The increase in CO2 emission is almost equal to the entire emissions of Portugal .'\n\n13.61. Despite this, our living dwellings today mimic a universalised model of living - dominated by concrete, closed spaces, less ventilation, and a higher need for air conditioning, as opposed to multi-generational family homes in older times. Traditional Indian living spaces were built far more sustainably - a central courtyard that allowed for ventilation, natural lighting and cooling, and more co-habitation, usage of local building materials that prevented the need for transporting the high amount of concrete over long distances, building practices that did not require highly mechanised environments and had local labour filling in the gap. Unfortunately, much of this is not documented as 'sustainable practice'.\n\n13.62.  The  world  knows  sustainable  housing  as  one  that  is  characterised  by  solar  and wind-powered  energy,  specially  manufactured  low-energy  windows,  and  the  use  of  LEDs. Unfortunately, keeping only these norms as a measure of sustainability is a false positive due to two reasons - 1) it requires reengineering of the entire building and construction ecosystem which is difficult in a resource-constrained environment 2) the impact of small measures is overcalculated in place of the lifecycle cost of higher-density, non-nucleated living with traditional building homes.\n\n13.63.  With more and more changes in Indian lifestyles of living, the environmental impact of these activities of a large population is only going to exacerbate the climate change issue.\n\n65    Rapid geographic expansion of urban areas, characterized by low-density residential developments, single-use zoning, and increased dependence on automobiles.\n\n66    Expanding urban footprint leads to habitat destruction and the fragmentation of natural areas, imposing external costs on ecosystems.\n\n67    Wu, W., Kanamori, Y., Zhang, R., Zhou, Q., Takahashi, K., &amp; Masui, T.
