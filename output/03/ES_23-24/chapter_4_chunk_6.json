  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nIndia's external sector remained strong amidst ongoing geopolitical headwinds and sticky inflation. Merchandise exports moderated due to lower demand from major trading partners, but services exports continued to perform well, cushioning the overall trade deficit from USD 121.6 billion in FY23 to USD 78.1 billion in FY24. Lower prices of imported commodities, including crude oil, also helped. The current account deficit (CAD) improved due to moderation in merchandise imports and rising services exports. Software/IT services drove an increase in overall exports, while business services exports also rose, supported by India emerging as a hub for Global Capability Centres (GCCs). India's participation in global value chains (GVCs) increased, with the share of GVC-related trade in gross trade rising to 40.3% in 2022 from 35.1% in 2019. The country's rank in the World Bank's Logistics Performance Index improved by six places, from 44th in 2018 to 38th in 2023. India witnessed positive net foreign portfolio investment (FPI) inflows of USD 44.1 billion in FY24, supported by strong economic growth, a stable business environment, and increased investor confidence. The Indian Rupee remained in a manageable range of ₹82 to ₹83.5/USD in FY24 and was the least volatile currency among its emerging market peers and a few advanced economies. The shock absorbers of India's external sector, including forex reserves, sustainable external debt indicators, and a market-determined exchange rate, are in place to cushion global headwinds. Going forward, the changing composition of India's export basket, enhancement in trade-related infrastructure, enhanced quality consciousness and product safety considerations in the private sector, and a stable policy environment are expected to drive India's rise as a global supplier of goods and services. India's trade openness indicator rose from 37.5 in FY05 to 45.9 in FY24, contributing significantly to economic growth. The share of trade (excluding petroleum products exports and crude oil imports) in GDP rose from 32.3% in FY05 to 40.8% in FY23. India's merchandise exports contracted in H2 of FY23 and H1 of FY24 due to geopolitical tensions but showed a trend reversal in H2 of FY24. The merchandise trade deficit narrowed to USD 238.3 billion in FY24 from USD 264.9 billion in the previous year. Non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery merchandise exports showed resilience with a sustained uptick, resulting in exports worth USD 320.2 billion in FY24, 1.5% higher than the previous year. India's defence production grew substantially from ₹74,054 crore in FY17 to ₹108,684 crore in FY23, boosting defence exports. India's toy exports registered a CAGR of 15.9% between FY13 and FY24, transforming India from a deficit to a surplus nation in the trade of toys. Footwear exports increased from USD 1.9 billion in FY21 to USD 2.5 billion in FY24. Smartphone exports ranked among India's top five export items, with a 42.2% increase in exports in FY24. India's domestic production and exports of smartphones have been increasing steadily, with significant changes achieved since the launch of the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme in 2020.\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Capital Account Balance\n\n## CAPITAL ACCOUNT BALANCE\n\n4.58 Stable capital inflows continue to finance the CAD. During FY24, net capital flows stood at USD 86.3 billion against USD 58.9 billion during the previous year, primarily driven by FPI flows and net inflows of banking capital (including NRI deposits).\n\n4.59 The  net  FPI  flows  saw  a  significant  turnaround  in  FY24.  Supported  by  optimism surrounding India's growth story, progressive policy reform, economic stability, fiscal prudence and attractive investment avenues, India witnessed robust FPI inflows in FY24. Net FPI inflows stood at USD 44.1 billion during FY24 against net outflows in the preceding two years. This is the highest level of FPI inflow after FY15. India received the highest equity inflows among\n\n89  Migration and Development Brief 40, World Bank\n\nemerging market peers during FY24. Financial services,  automobile  and  auto  components, healthcare,  and  capital  goods  were  the  significant  sectors  attracting  equity  inflows  during FY24. The recent inclusion of India's Sovereign Bonds in the JP Morgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets 90  is expected to contribute to higher debt inflows going forward and will likely spur demand for further exposure to India.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4.60 The  UNCTAD  World  Investment  Report  2024 91   highlights  that  global  FDI  declined marginally by 2 per cent to USD 1.3 trillion in 2023 from USD 1.4 trillion in 2022. Weakening growth  prospects,  economic  fracturing  trends,  trade  and  geopolitical  tensions,  industrial policies and supply chain diversification are reshaping FDI patterns, causing some multinational enterprises (MNEs) to adopt a cautious approach to overseas expansion. International project finance and cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;As) were especially weak in 2023. M&amp;As, which mostly affect FDI in developed countries, fell by 46 per cent in value. Project finance, important for infrastructure investment, was down 26 per cent. Tighter financing conditions, investor uncertainty, volatility in financial markets and tighter regulatory scrutiny were the principal  causes  of  the  decline.  However,  Greenfield  investment  project  announcements provided a bright spot, with the number of projects increasing by 2 per cent, with the growth concentrated in manufacturing.\n\n90 On September 21, 2023, JPMorgan announced the inclusion of the Indian government bonds to its benchmark emergingmarket index, i.e., JPMorgan Government Bond Index-Emerging Markets- starting June 28, 2024.\n\n91   UNCTAD World Investment Report 2024-Investment Facilitation and Digital Government, https://unctad.org/system/files/ official-document/wir2024\\_overview\\_en.pdf\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4.61 The decline in global FDI flows has also impacted FDI flows to India. Net FDI inflows 93 to India declined from USD 42.0 billion during FY23 to USD 26.5 billion in FY24. However, gross FDI inflows moderated only by 0.6 per cent from USD 71.4 billion in FY23 to just under USD 71 billion in FY24. In other words, there was no change in investor interest in India. The contraction in net inflows was primarily due to a surge in repatriation/disinvestment due to many profitable exits. A market that allows investors to take profits and exit their investments is a healthy one. That is why the repatriation of investment increased from USD 29.3 billion in FY23 to USD 44.5 billion in FY24. The decline in FDI inflows in recent years is also attributable to  higher  interest  rates  in  developed  countries  and  attractive  exits  out  of  India  due  to  the buoyant stock market.\n\n## An examination of change in trend and composition of FDI flows\n\n## FDI in the industry vs services sector\n\n4.62 A close examination of the FDI equity inflows into major sectors reveals that FDI inflow into the industry and services sectors 94  has weakened in recent years. In fact, for both these sectors, the FDI-to-GDP ratio has dipped below pre-pandemic levels. The share of industry sectors' FDI in GDP declined from 0.62 per cent in FY20 to 0.39 per cent in FY24. During the same period, the share of the services sector in GDP fell from 0.87 per cent to 0.69 per cent.\n\n92  RBI data has been used here as DPIIT does not give data on Repatriation/Disinvestment\n\n93  Net FDI inflows=Gross FDI Inflows-Repatriation/Disinvestment\n\n94    Industry includes sectors such as drugs and pharmaceuticals, automobile industry, chemical, construction, electronics, etc. Services  include  sectors  such  as  computer  software  and  hardware,  banking  and  insurance  services,  telecommunications, consultancy services, etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Physical FDI vs Digital FDI\n\n4.63 FDI inflows can be divided into physical and digital for further analysis.  Physical FDI includes  sectors  such  as  automobiles,  pharmaceuticals,  and  construction,  while  digital  FDI includes computer services, telecommunications, consultancy services, and information and broadcasting. 95  A few years ago (FY14), physical FDI was about three times the value of digital FDI. Owing to a rise in foreign investment in sectors such as software and hardware, consultancy services, and telecommunications, among others, digital FDI witnessed an increase, coupled with a relative decline in physical FDI.\n\n4.64 Nomura's Global Market Research May 2024, 'Asia's New Flying Geese', highlights that rising protectionism and geopolitical tensions have triggered the stagnation of physical FDI. One factor exacerbating this trend is the growing prevalence of non-equity modes of international production,  such  as  contract  manufacturing,  third-party  outsourcing  or  franchising.  Under these  scenarios,  while  economies  may  become more integrated into GVCs, this may not be reflected in the FDI data. During the pandemic, there was a surge in the share of digital services in total FDI owing to the prevalence of work-from-home culture and the availability of efficient digital infrastructure. As a result, the share of digital FDI in total FDI rose from 46.6 per cent in FY17 to 69.2 per cent in FY21. However, both digital and physical FDI have been falling in recent times. The fall in digital FDI has much to do with tech start-ups. Following a big increase during the pandemic, global flows into tech start-ups have fallen, a global trend in flows that is mirrored in India as well.\n\n95    Reference: HSBC Global Research: India's FDI Mystery, Shifting Frontiers, https://www.hsbc.co.in/wealth/insights/marketoutlook/india-economics/2024-01/\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Actual FDI vs intentions\n\n4.65 The declining FDI flows to India are at odds with India gaining market share in global trade in goods and services exports. In this context, an exercise was undertaken to understand the relationship between FDI inflows and investment intentions. Two data sources have been used to estimate intentions. One is the UNCTAD data on announced greenfield FDI projects; the other is CMIE's announced foreign private sector projects. 96\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\n96    The UNCTAD data only refers to greenfield investments, while the CMIE database includes different sectors. UNCTAD records data when there is a clear indication that jobs and new capex will be created, while CMIE includes projects even before essential licenses or land has been obtained/acquired or the funding has been tied up.\n\n4.66 Over time, there  has  been  a  significant  change  in  the  trend  in  investment  intentions across  sectors.  While  investment  intentions  in  industries  such  as  computers  and  chemicals have softened, investment intentions in new and futuristic sectors are increasing. 97  In recent quarters,  investment  intentions  in  new  and  futuristic  sectors,  such  as  renewables,  artificial intelligence, data centres, EVs and batteries, green hydrogen, and semiconductors, have rapidly risen. India was a leading destination for AI-related FDI in 2022, receiving 122 AI-related FDI projects in 2022, with multinational companies such as ABB, Accenture, Deloitte, IBM, and Microsoft announcing investments in the country. 98  According to research by NASSCOM, India is an attractive destination for AI investment due to its relatively low operating costs and the world's second-largest pool of highly skilled AI, machine learning, and big data workers. 99\n\n4.67 A detailed examination of CMIE Investment Intentions and UNCTAD data on greenfield projects reveals that a strong correlation of more than 56 per cent exists between these data sources. Chart IV.30a shows that investment intentions have been a good predictor of future FDI inflows. FDI inflows followed the same direction as CMIE Investment Intentions till FY15; however, in FY16, the trend diverged.\n\n4.68 An  estimation  of  FDI  concentration  using  the  Hershman-Herfindahl  Index  (HHI) 100 highlights a positive correlation between total FDI inflows and the concentration index, which implies that in years in which the Indian economy witnessed a surge in FDI inflows, FDI was concentrated in a few sectors only and was not broad-based across sectors, and vice-versa.\n\n4.69 India has a well-established infrastructure to attract FDI in select sectors, i.e., greenfield projects such as renewables, digital services such as telecommunications, software and hardware, and consultancy services. However, this may be different across the board. Therefore, where investment intentions are high, the sectors must be made more accessible for investments. Notably, the focus must remain on improving the ease of doing business across sectors and extend beyond sectors attractive to FDI alone. While several low-hanging fruits with respect to the 'Ease of Doing Business' have been plucked already over the years, further work may lie in details across all levels of government - national, state and local - and across regulators.\n\n4.70 An article in Bloomberg in April 2024 101  noted that India was not competing with other developing nations only to attract FDI. It is competing with advanced nations who now actively and  aggressively  pursue  industrial  policies  that  privilege  domestic  investment  by  dangling subsidies to businesses to prevent them from investing abroad and to entice other overseas investors  who  might  otherwise  consider  emerging  nations  like  India.  Educated  labour  and a  skilled  workforce coupled with a vibrant R&amp;D culture are important magnets, apart from\n\n97  As per the CMIE investment intentions data sector-wise\n\n98  Global trends for FDI in AI, https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/features/what-are-the-global-trends-for-fdi-in-ai/?cf-view\n\n99   NASSCOM Strategic Report-resilience to Resurgence: Technology Sector in India 2022, https://nasscom.in/knowledge-center/\n\npublications/technology-sector-india-2022-strategic-review\n\n100  Hershman Herfindahl Index has been calculated by taking the sum of squares of the share of each sector in total FDI inflows 101   'Biden  Trumps  Modi  In  Fight  for  Foreign  Investment',  Bloomberg,  4  April  2024  (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/ newsletters/2024-04-04/modi-vs-biden-why-foreign-investment-into-india-is-still-declining)\n\npolitical  stability,  policy  predictability  and  stability,  reasonable  duties  and  taxes,  dispute resolution mechanisms and ease of repatriation. India has made considerable progress in many of these areas over the years. There may be unfinished work in other areas. But, above all, the route to sustained investor interest and consequent accumulation of knowledge and know-how in India may lie through better educational and skill outcomes.\n\n4.71 The box below discusses how increased FDI inflows from China can help in increasing India's global supply chain participation along with a push to exports.\n\n## Box IV.6: China Plus One strategy\n\nOver the last five years, a seismic change has occurred in the global manufacturing realm, with major multinational companies, including Apple and others, looking to 'de-risk' themselves from China, which was traditionally known as the 'world's factory'. This shift is primarily due to disruptions caused by COVID-19, growing tensions between the US and China, and rising costs of doing business in China. As a result, several companies have adopted a 'China plus one strategy' to reduce their reliance on China for high-tech electronic products and components. This approach involves supply chain decisions to decrease their risk exposure to China. For example, over 90 per cent of manufacturers in North America surveyed by the Boston Consulting Group in 2023 moved some or all of their production to other countries like Mexico, Thailand, and Vietnam, suggesting a move away from China. 102\n\nCan India benefit from this 'China plus one' strategy? The appeal of India lies in its large domestic consumer market, which makes it attractive for companies to set up operations there. In the electronics sector, there is a focus on smartphone manufacturing and assembly. The Government's PLI scheme, including tax breaks and subsidies, plays a significant role in attracting companies. The rise in India's domestic smartphone demand is also a key factor in companies' decisions to invest there. For instance, Apple assembled USD 14 billion worth of iPhones in India during FY24, constituting 14 per cent of its global iPhone production. 103 Foxconn has started production of Apple mobile phones in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. 104\n\nWhile India may not be an immediate beneficiary of the trade diversion from China, it has witnessed a substantial increase in its electronic exports over time. The implementation of the PLI scheme has been a key driver of this growth. For instance, India's electronic exports to the US have transitioned from a trade deficit of USD 0.6 billion in FY17 to a trade surplus of USD 8.7 billion in FY24, underscoring a significant increase in value addition. Within the electronics sector, the category that has experienced the most growth is mobile phones, with exports to the US rising from USD 2.2 billion in FY23 to USD 5.7 billion in FY24.\n\nAs India looks to deepen its involvement in Global Value Chains (GVCs), it will look to the successes and strategies of East Asian economies. These economies have typically pursued\n\n102  Boston Consultancy Group article, 'Harnessing the Tectonic Shifts in Global Manufacturing', https://tinyurl.com/bnrcrddz. 103    India Briefing, 'Apple's Contract Manufacturers and Component Suppliers in India', dated 17 April 2024,  https://tinyurl. com/357mv7hy\n\ntwo main strategies: reducing trade costs and facilitating foreign investment. Given that GVCs are designed to minimise costs, countries like Malaysia, Vietnam, and Taiwan have focused on lowering their trade costs over time. For India, improving logistical efficiency has been a key focus, as evidenced by a noticeable rise in India's score on the World Bank's LPI (as discussed in para 4.49). The second strategy, focused on investment facilitation, includes actions to increase and stabilise foreign investment. The PLI scheme, for example, encourages high-quality foreign investment by offering a market-linked incentive system for companies to comply with.\n\nOver the medium term, India is focusing on integrating its value chain with that of the West, particularly in sectors like renewable energy and advanced technology, including artificial intelligence,  semiconductors,  and  next-generation  telecommunications.  This  strategy  is being pursued through agreements such as the Australia-India Free Trade Agreement and the US-India Clean Energy Initiative. As a result, the trading patterns within these sectors are starting to develop. For example, the tariff classifications for environmentally friendly technology, such as solar water heaters, waste recycling devices, and wind turbines, show an increase in exports to the USA from USD 199.2 million in FY20 to USD 326.9 million in FY24 105 .  Further, leading American and European companies in the renewable energy sector, such as First Solar, Vesta, and Scatec, have established their operations in India to take advantage of the growing demand for green technologies.\n\nWill China plus one result in a total movement of trading relations away from China? This may not be the case. Take, for example, nations like Mexico, Vietnam, Taiwan and Korea, which were direct beneficiaries of the US's trade diversion from China. Even while these nations increased their share of exports to the US, they also displayed a concomitant rise in Chinese FDI. 106  Therefore, the world cannot completely look past China, even as it pursues China plus one.\n\nIndia faces two choices to benefit from China plus one strategy: it can integrate into China's supply chain or promote FDI from China. Among these choices, focusing on FDI from China seems more promising for boosting India's exports to the US, similar to how East Asian economies did in the past. Moreover, choosing FDI as a strategy to benefit from the China plus one approach appears more advantageous than relying on trade. This is because China is India's top import partner, and the trade deficit with China has been growing. As the US and Europe shift their immediate sourcing away from China, it is more effective to have Chinese companies invest in India and then export the products to these markets rather than importing from China, adding minimal value, and then re-exporting them. Further,\n\n105  HS Code-8402, 8406 and 8414.\n\n106    Sourced from the presentation made by Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, Economic Counsellor and Director of Research Department, IMF at NCEAR, India Policy Forum on 2 July 2024, 'CRACKS IN THE SYSTEM: How Geo-Economic Fragmentation is Reshaping the World'\n\na recent research note from the Rhodium Group points out, 'China's dominance over so many product categories creates, first and foremost, a risk of economic coercion, where the government restrains access to crucial inputs for political leverage.' 107   The same brief also notes, 'Brazil and Turkey have raised barriers to imports of Chinese EVs, but enacted measures to attract Chinese FDI in the sector.' European nations, too, have decided to follow a  similar  approach 108 .  Hence,  it  is  imperative  that  India  finds  the  right  balance  between importing goods from China and importing capital (FDI) from China.\n\n## Comfortable Foreign Exchange Reserves\n\n4.72 A moderation in the CAD amidst large capital inflows enabled the addition of foreign exchange reserves (FER) in FY24. The buffer of FER insulates domestic economic activity from global spillovers. These reserves act as a cushion and provide liquidity, ensuring India can meet its  external obligations. During FY24, India's FER increased by USD 68 billion, the highest increase among major foreign exchange reserves-holding countries. FER stood at USD 653.7 billion on 21 June 2024, enough to cover more than 10 months of imports projected for FY25 and more than 98 per cent of total external debt outstanding at the end of March 2024.\n\n## Chart IV.31: India witnessed the most significant increase in foreign exchange reserves holdings in FY24\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/AEGMLN+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource:  Bloomberg,  RBI  for  India  (Handbook  of  Statistics  on  Indian  Economy,  Foreign  Exchange  Reserves, Weekly, RBI)\n\n107  How China's Overcapacity Holds Back Emerging Economies', Rhodium Group, 13 June 2024 https://tinyurl.com/y9d6rpna. 108  'Europe's Response to China Shock 2.0: Hold China Closer', Wall Street Journal, 23 June 2024 https://tinyurl.com/j8trksxv\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Exchange Rates\n\n4.73 Despite  FY24  being  marked  by  geopolitical  risks,  rising  interest  rates  and  volatile commodity prices, the US economy exhibited resilience with positive economic indicators such as a tight labour market and upbeat consumer sentiments. These factors contributed to drawing global funds to US treasury markets as there was a higher demand for greenback on safe-haven appeal. In FY24, the US Dollar gained against virtually every major peer. The Rupee also came under  depreciation  pressure.  However,  INR  was  one  of  the  least  volatile  major  currencies. Further, it exhibited the lowest volatility in FY24 compared to the previous years. An estimation of volatility using the coefficient of variation (CV) highlights that CV was 0.58 during FY24, much lower than in the past years. The relative stability of the rupee, despite a stronger US dollar and elevated US treasury yields, reflects the strength of the Indian economy's sound macroeconomic fundamentals, financial stability, and improvements in external position. In the future, robust foreign inflows and comfortable trade deficits are expected to keep the rupee within a comfortable range.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4.74 The Rupee/USD exchange rate was in the range of ₹82-83.5/USD in FY24, depreciating against USD by only 2.9 per cent during FY24. The Rupee depreciated by 6.9 and 6.8 per cent against Pound Sterling and Euro, respectively, in FY24. However, it appreciated by 3.5 per cent against Japanese Yen during the period.\n\n4.75 The  exchange  rate  of  the  INR  is  market-determined.  The  RBI  regulates  the  foreign exchange market to ensure its orderly functioning and development and intervenes only to curb undue volatility in the INR. It has managed to contain INR volatility and keep foreign exchange markets stable.  Recently, it announced various measures to diversify and expand the sources of forex funding to mitigate exchange rate volatility and dampen global spillovers. For example, the regulatory regime relating to FPI investment in debt flows has been revised to encourage foreign investment in Indian debt instruments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Table No. 206, 'Sale and Purchase of US Dollar by Reserve Bank of India', External Sector, Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy, RBI\n\n4.76 The indices of Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) and Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) are used as indicators of external competitiveness. 109  In terms of 40-currency (trade-weighted), NEER depreciated by 0.6 per cent in FY24. However, REER appreciated by 0.8 per cent in FY24. In May 2024, NEER at 92.2 and REER at 104.7 recorded appreciation of 0.03 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively.\n\n## Chart IV.36: Movement of index of 40-Currency NEER and REER (trade-based weight) (Base year 2015-16 = 100)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Table No. 202, 'Indices of Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) and Nominal Effective Exchange Rate (NEER) of the Indian Rupee (40-currency bilateral weights, monthly average), External Sector, Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy, RBI\n\n4.77 The box below discusses the impact of exchange rate changes on the Indian economy through the trade channel as well as the financial channel.\n\n## Box IV.7: Trade and Financial channels of the Exchange rate\n\nHistorically, a depreciated currency has been a key driver of export growth. The Marshal Lerner  conditions,  if  met,  suggest  that  currency  depreciation  can  stimulate  an  increase in net exports by reducing export costs and increasing import prices. This 'trade' channel of  the  exchange  rate  has  been  well-documented  for  India.  However,  the  exchange  rate also influences the external sector through a 'financial' channel. Theory suggests that the financial channel of the exchange rate can potentially counterbalance the gains (or losses) made through the trade channel.\n\nA weak Rupee can affect the Balance of Payments (BoP) by changing the supply and cost of  foreign  funding.  For  instance,  depreciation  can  reduce  the  creditworthiness  of  local borrowers if they have Rupee-denominated assets and borrow in foreign currencies. This could raise the cost of foreign lending and lead to a net capital outflow. Globally, appreciation in domestic currencies (against the dollar) has increased cross-border banking capital flows. 110 However, Kearns and Patel (2016) show that the financial channel of the exchange rate is generally more potent in EMEs, where unhedged foreign currency exposures are more likely to be present. 111\n\n109    NEER is the weighted average of bilateral nominal exchange rates of the home currency in terms of foreign currencies. The REER is defined as a weighted average of nominal exchange rates adjusted for relative price differential between domestic and foreign countries.\n\n110  Bruno, V., &amp; Shin, H. S. (2015). Capital flows and the risk-taking channel of monetary policy. Journal of monetary economics, 71, 119-132.\n\n111  Banerjee, R., Hofmann, B., &amp; Mehrotra, A. N. (2020). Corporate investment and the exchange rate: The financial channel.\n\nOver the last two decades, India's FDI and equity portfolio inflows have totalled about 2.5 per cent of GDP annually (IMF, 2023). 112  In general, inflows to the capital account increased by 65 per cent between FY-14 and FY-24. Therefore, in the context of India's large and growing financial account with the rest of the world, whether the Rupee should remain competitive is a question to ponder.\n\nTo answer this question, the two different channels of the exchange rate were estimated using  a  trade-weighted  exchange  rate  and  a  debt-weighted  exchange  rate.  The  tradeweighted Nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) provided by the RBI is used to capture the trade channel. The financial channel is captured by a debt-weighted exchange rate (DWER), which is constructed as an arithmetic average of the Rupee against major foreign currencies, weighted by their share in the composition of external debt.\n\nIn theory, the net BoP must equate to zero as trade surpluses (deficits) equate to capital account deficits (surpluses). However, in practice, countries report net Bop deficits/surpluses with rare instances of BoP equilibrium. Literature explains BoP disequilibria as a monetary disequilibrium and as the result of excess supply or demand for currency. 113  Therefore, to study the extent to which the two channels (trade and financial) counteract the other in the presence of currency movement, the dependent variable used here is net BoP.\n\nAn auto-regressive distributed lag (ARDL) model is deployed to capture the separate channels of a Rupee depreciation/appreciation on net Balance of Payments (BoP). The problem of endogeneity is controlled for in an ARDL framework in the absence of autocorrelation of errors. Further, multicollinearity is also not a significant issue as lags and differences of the variables are used.\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nThe data used is at a quarterly frequency between Q1 of FY12 to Q3 of FY24. The dependent variable  is  the  net  balance  of  payment  in  nominal  terms  calculated  as  Ln  (BoP  Credit)/ (BoP Debit); DWER represents the debt-weighted exchange rate. The coefficients δ i and β i indicate  the  elasticity  of  net  BoP  to  changes  in  the  debt  channel  of  the  exchange  rate and the trade channel of the exchange rate. X t includes  control  variables  such  as  World imports, repo rate, commodity prices, domestic demand, GDP deflator and a dummy for the COVID-19 years (March 2020 to March 2022). Optimal lags for the regressors are chosen according to the AIC criterion.\n\nDependent variable - Net BoP\n\n| Regressor   | Long run Elasticity   |\n|-------------|-----------------------|\n| DWER        | 0.16*                 |\n| NEER        | -0.7*                 |\n\n'*' denotes significance at the 10 per cent level\n\nThe results indicate that India's trade channel is stronger than the financial channel. Over the long run, the net effect of an appreciation is negative ( -0.7 + 0.16). Thus, a per cent appreciation of the Rupee results in a net decline in the BoP by 0.54 per cent.\n\n112  IMF, 2024 India's Financial System: Building the Foundation for Strong and Sustainable Growth\n\n113  See for instance, Frenkel, J., &amp; Mussa, M.

Towards a General Theory of the Balance of Payments.\n\nIn  addition  to  conducting  post-estimation  checks  for  serial  correlation  and  parameter stability (CUSUM test), robustness checks were performed by studying the variables in a dynamic OLS framework. The result of the robustness check is provided below:\n\nDependent variable - Net BoP\n\n| Regressor   | Long run Elasticity   |\n|-------------|-----------------------|\n| DWER        | 0.12**                |\n| NEER        | -1.01**               |\n\n'**' denotes significance at the 5 per cent level\n\nThe results outline that a competitive Rupee continues to boost the BoP as the benefits received through the trade channel outweigh the costs incurred in the financial channel. As noted by Longaric 2022, India's high trade openness and low share of external debt mean that the trade channel effect of currency fluctuations dominates the financial channel effect. This contrasts with other EMEs, such as Brazil and the Philippines, whose financial channel effect dominates the trade effect.\n\n## INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT POSITION (IIP)\n\n4.78 The Net IIP 114  position determines whether a country is a net creditor or debtor nation by measuring the difference between its external assets and liabilities. As of the end of March 2024, Indian residents' overseas financial assets at USD 1,028.3 billion were higher by USD 109.7 billion or 11.9 per cent compared to the level as of March 2023, mainly due to a rise in reserve assets, currency and deposits, overseas direct investment, trade credit and advances and loans. Reserve assets at USD 646.4 billion, accounting for around 62.9 per cent of India's international financial assets, increased by 11.8 per cent over the same period.\n\nImprovement in India's net IIP in end-March 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4.79 International liabilities at USD 1,390 billion as of the end of March 2024 were higher by USD 104.3 billion (8.1 per cent) as compared to the level in March 2023. The rise was attributed mainly  to  an  increase  in  portfolio  investment,  loan,  direct  investment  and  other  accounts payable. The share of debt liabilities in total external liabilities was 51.1 per cent as of March 2024.\n\n4.80  Thus, the net claims of non-residents in India, valued at USD 361.7 billion as of the end of March 2024, declined by USD 5.5 billion over the level of March 2023. India's international financial assets covered 74 per cent of international financial liabilities as of the end of March 2024.",
