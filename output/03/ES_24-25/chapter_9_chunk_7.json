  "content": "Chapter 9 Summary:\nThe agricultural sector in India has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23. The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, providing a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) to develop and conserve natural resources alongside farming systems. The agricultural sector faces challenges such as climate change, water scarcity, and soil degradation, which require focused and targeted interventions. The sector's growth potential is significant, with opportunities for agro-based entrepreneurship and employment generation. The government has launched several initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). The food processing industry is also a critical sector, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The sector's growth is crucial for ensuring food security and achieving sustainable development goals.\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Agriculture Mechanisation: Facilitating Access\n\n## AGRICULTURE MECHANISATION: Facilitating access\n\n9.29 The  high  machinery  cost  presents  a  significant  barrier  to  promoting  farm mechanisation among small and marginal farmers. Custom hiring arrangements can enhance these farmers' adoption of farm mechanisation, particularly in regions where mechanisation is currently limited. The Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanisation (SMAM)  supports  state  governments  with  training  and  demonstrations  related  to agricultural machinery, in establishing Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs), and assisting farmers  in  acquiring  various  farming  equipment.  Further,  farm  machinery  banks enable  the  renting  of  machinery  at  affordable  rates,  thereby  promoting  access  to high-tech machinery for small and marginal farm holdings in areas with low levels of mechanisation. As of 31 December, 26,662 CHCs were established under this initiative, with 138 CHCs set up in the year FY25 alone.\n\n9.30 Furthermore, the government has promoted a recently approved scheme aimed at  providing drones to Women SHGs. This initiative targets 15000 selected Women SHGs to offer rental services to farmers for agricultural purposes, including for the application of fertilisers and pesticides. Central financial assistance of 80 percent of the drone's cost and related ancillary charges, up to a maximum of ₹8 lakh, will be granted to  the  women  SHGs  for  drone  purchases.  This  scheme  will  also  deliver  sustainable business and livelihood support to the SHGs, enabling them to generate an additional income of at least ₹1 lakh per annum.\n\n28    Weather Information and Network Data Systems (WINDS), Yield Estimation System based on Technology (YESTech), Collection of Real Time Observations and Photographs of Crops (CROPIC) provide real time data on weather, yield and uploading full size photos of crops.",
