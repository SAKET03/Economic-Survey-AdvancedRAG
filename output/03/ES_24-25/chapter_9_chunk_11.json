  "content": "Chapter 9 Summary:\nThe agricultural sector in India has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23. The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, providing a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) to develop and conserve natural resources alongside farming systems. The agricultural sector faces challenges such as climate change, water scarcity, and soil degradation, which require focused and targeted interventions. The sector's growth potential is significant, with opportunities for agro-based entrepreneurship and employment generation. The government has launched several initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). The food processing industry is also a critical sector, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The sector's growth is crucial for ensuring food security and achieving sustainable development goals.\n\nSubchapter 11 Content:\n# Allied Sectors: Potential to Build Resilience\n\n## ALLIED SECTORS: Potential to Build Resilience\n\n9.39 The livestock sector has emerged as a significant engine of growth in agriculture, playing a vital role in the overall agricultural landscape. This importance is underscored by  a  remarkable  increase  in  its  contribution  to  the  Gross  Value  Added  (GVA)  of agriculture and related sectors, which surged from 24.38 per cent in the fiscal year FY15 to an impressive 30.23 per cent by FY23. In the latter year, the livestock sector alone represented 5.5 per cent of the total GVA, reflecting its dynamic growth trajectory, with a robust CAGR of 12.99 per cent.\n\n9.40 The economic significance of this sector is clearly illustrated by its escalating output  value,  which  reached  an  astounding  17.25  lakh  crore  rupees  (equivalent  to US$205.81  billion)  in  FY23.  Among  the  various  branches  of  livestock  production, the milk industry stands out, generating over ₹11.16 lakh crore (US$133.16 billion) in revenue. This figure highlights the sector's vitality and reveals its dominance, eclipsing the  aggregate  production  value  of  staple  crops  like  paddy  and  wheat.  The  livestock\n\nsector is thus not just a contributor to the economy; it is a cornerstone of agricultural prosperity and food security, propelling the rural economy and livelihoods along the way.\n\n9.41    The  government has supported the sector through various initiatives by recognising the growing importance of the livestock sector and its potential to boost farm incomes. The  interventions  include  the  Rashtriya  Gokul  Mission  for  the  development  and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds, the Livestock Health and Disease Control Program to enhance the well-being of livestock, the promotion of IVF technology and sex-sorted semen production to increase the productivity of female cows and initiatives to encourage the formation and growth of FPOs and SHGs to strengthen the sector. Further, the mechanism of Multipurpose AI Technicians in Rural India (MAITRIs) has been established to deliver breeding inputs to farmers' doorstep. In the last 4 years, 38736 MAITRIs have been inducted under Rashtriya Gokul Mission.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.42 The government has implemented several initiatives to enhance the fisheries sector's  production  and  productivity  over  the  past  decade.  The  Pradhan  Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) was established to boost aquaculture productivity and  improve  fisheries  management.  Additionally,  the  Fisheries  and  Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) was introduced to provide financial support for  developing  infrastructure  in  both  marine  and  inland  fisheries.  Other  supportive measures  include  the  establishment  of  fishing  harbours  and  fish  landing  centres, the  adoption  of  innovative  production  technologies  such  as  cages 31 ,  Recirculating\n\n31  Cages are netted enclosures in water bodies like lakes or rivers, allowing water flow while containing fish.\n\nAquaculture Systems (RAS) 32 , bio flocs 33 , pens 34 , and raceways 35 , as well as initiatives focused  on  transforming  waste  into  wealth  through  the  expansion  of  saline  water aquaculture, and the growth of freshwater fisheries, cold water fisheries, ornamental fisheries, and pearl cultivation. Significant investment has also been made in marketing and transportation infrastructure, along with the development of cold storage facilities.\n\n- 9.43 Due  to  these  initiatives,  total  fish  production  (both  inland  and  marine)  has surged to 184.02 lakh tonnes in FY 23, up from 95.79 lakh tonnes in FY14. Furthermore, India's seafood exports have risen from ₹46,662.85 crore in FY-20 to ₹60523.89 crore in 2023-24, reflecting a growth of 29.70 per cent.\n- 9.44 Under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY), the National Fisheries Digital Platform (NFDP) was launched, successfully mobilising and registering 16.35 lakh fish producers, workers, vendors, and processors within a short timeframe of just four months.\n\n## COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES:  Strengthening the Institution to serve better\n\n- 9.45 Cooperative  societies  in  India  serve  a  vital  function  across  many  sectors, including  agriculture,  credit  and  banking,  housing,  and  women's  welfare.  These societies are essential in promoting financial inclusion, particularly by extending credit to farmers and small entrepreneurs who frequently encounter barriers when accessing conventional banking services.\n- 9.46 To strengthen the cooperative sector, the Indian government has implemented various  strategic  initiatives.  These  include  the  introduction  of  Model  Bye-Laws specifically  for  Primary  Agricultural  Credit  Societies  (PACS),  designed  to  provide a  structured  framework  for  their  operations.  Additionally,  the  government  has prioritised the computerisation of PACS to enhance efficiency and transparency. There is also an ongoing effort to establish new multipurpose PACS and dedicated dairy and fishery cooperatives, which serve diverse community needs. Another key focus is the transformation of PACS into Common Service Centres (CSCs), which are intended to provide services beyond financial assistance.\n- 9.47 Other noteworthy measures aimed at enriching the cooperative landscape include the establishment of retail petrol and diesel outlets and the setting up of micro-ATMs within cooperative societies to facilitate easier access to banking services. Moreover, the issuance of RuPay Kisan Credit Cards specifically for dairy cooperatives aims to improve the financial capabilities of these entities and their members.\n- 9.48 The  achievements  of  these  initiatives  are  significant.  Over  9,000  new  PACS, dairy,  and  fishery  cooperatives  in  underserved  panchayats  have  been  established,\n\n32  RAS uses tanks to grow fish while continuously filtering and reusing water.\n\n33    Biofloc systems use microorganisms (bacteria, algae) to convert organic waste, uneaten feed, and excreta into protein-rich feed directly in the water.\n\n34    Pens are netted enclosures in natural water bodies, restricting fish to a specific area while allowing water exchange.\n\n35    Raceways  are  narrow  channels  with  continuous  one-way  water  flow,  supplying  oxygen  and  removing  waste efficiently.\n\nreceiving  support  from  various  federations.  As  part  of  the  government's  push  for greater accessibility, 240 PACS have applied for retail petrol and diesel outlets, with 39 currently selected to operate, thus expanding their service offerings. Furthermore, a substantial number-35,293 PACS-are now functioning as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samriddhi Kendras (PMKSK), which are dedicated to providing essential  fertilisers and related services to farmers, directly impacting agricultural productivity. Further, 1,723 micro-ATMs have been distributed, facilitating doorstep financial services and enhancing accessibility for rural populations.",
