Historical parallels with earlier technological revolutions reveal the critical role of inclusive institutions in managing disruption and ensuring equitable outcomes. India\\'s demographic advantage and diverse economic landscape position it uniquely to benefit from AI, but achieving these benefits requires significant investments in education and workforce skilling. \\n\\nThe chapter discusses the potential impact of AI on labor markets, citing estimates that nearly 75 million jobs globally are at risk of automation due to AI. The International Labour Organisation estimates that 75 million jobs may be displaced, while the International Monetary Fund warns that AI poses risks of job displacements, particularly for emerging markets and developing economies. \\n\\nIn India, an IIM Ahmedabad survey highlights that 68% of surveyed employees expect their jobs to be partially or fully automated by AI within the next five years. The NASSCOM estimates that the Indian AI market will grow at 25-35% CAGR by 2027. \\n\\nThe chapter emphasizes the need for robust institutions to ensure that the gains from technology translate into inclusive growth. Enabling institutions focus on equipping the workforce with necessary skills, while insuring institutions provide a safety net for workers. Stewarding institutions are necessary to design an approach that balances public welfare without stifling innovation. \\n\\nThe chapter also discusses the challenges of scaling up AI adoption, including reliability, resource efficiency, and infrastructure deficits. It highlights that AI\\'s experimental nature makes its real-world utility unclear, and that the industry\\'s focus on increasing AI adoption may not be sufficient to validate the technology. \\n\\nThe resource challenge is critical, with training AI models becoming increasingly expensive and data centers consuming large amounts of electricity and water. The chapter concludes that India\\'s services-driven economy offers opportunities for enhancing productivity, and that education and skilling are critical to driving success. \\n\\nThe chapter also estimates demand elasticities for India\\'s services sectors, finding that sectors like financial services, health and social work, and business services have high elasticities, indicating potential for employment growth. The chapter argues that labor-augmenting technology can increase productivity and employment, and that India\\'s workforce must be equipped with future-ready skills to capitalize on emerging technologies.\"\\n    }\\n  }\\n]'}}\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# The Labour Market Evolution\n\n## THE LABOUR MARKET EVOLUTION\n\n13.47  Labour and Technology, when integrated in the right way, have complemented one another rather than being substitutes. Further, technical change did not always lead to declining employment in the affected industry; rather, it has resulted in strong employment growth during the decades the technology was being refined. For instance, Bessen (2018) 45  investigated the impact automated manufacturing had on the textiles, steel, and automotive industries of the United States. The findings demonstrated that productivity gains due to automation led to robust job growth and higher earnings for workers over the course of nearly four decades before plateauing.\n\n13.48  Studies assessing the introduction of robots in factories corroborate the same. While the employment share in routine manual jobs declined due to the adoption of automated robots on the factory floor, this in no way led to capital substituting for labour  in  the  advanced  economies 46 .  Such  effects  were  also  visible  in  developing countries,  where  robots  in  fact  reduced  unemployment  growth  as  robotic  work  and human work integrated with one another over time 47 . Specifically in the case of India, a study by Mani (2018) illustrated how the introduction of robots only accounted for the replacement of only 10 jobs per 10000 in the manufacturing sector by 2016 48 . This was primarily concentrated in automobiles, while the rest of the manufacturing sector remained largely unaffected by automation.\n\n13.49  Similarly,  Albanesi  et  al.  (2024)  introduced  some  much-needed  balance  to the  literature  on  the  effects  of  AI/ML  led  automation  on  white-collar  jobs 49 .  Their assessment of the impact of AI/ML on white-collar jobs in Europe suggests that there exists a positive association between AI-enabled automation as the sector-occupation employment share of high-skilled workers increases in the range of 3.1 per cent to 6.6 per cent over the course of a decade.\n\n45    Bessen, J.

Employees  were  able  to  substantially  improve  their  problem  resolution,  leading  to higher customer satisfaction. Cogito, a customer support firm, has been encouraging the use of AI assistants, which are able to analyse customer sentiments and provide real-time  feedback  to  customer  support  representatives,  improving  the  efficiency  of issue resolution. Implementing AI as a tool helps bridge the skill gap in this domain, allowing low-skilled workers to produce outputs closer in quality to the work highskilled workers do without any tools. The reduction in skill inequality is a big positive on aggregate since the overall productivity increases.\n\n13.51 In more complex fields such as scientific research, Human-AI teams are able to  generate  high-quality  outputs  by  capitalising  on  the  best  of  human  and  machine intelligence. For instance, Charness et al. (2023) find that AI-assisted research design benefits in five core aspects: Questions and Literature, generating testable hypotheses and  methodologies  for  testing,  instructions  and  comprehension  checks,  generating experimental code and related documentation, and auditing for errors 51 . Prof. Noshir Contractor of Northwestern University also cites several other instances in his research where AI-enabled researchers benefitted from the capacity of the machine for processing vast  amounts of scientific  data  for  hypothesis  generation,  enhanced  data  collection, manuscript review, and meta-analysis, among others 52 .\n\n13.52  Supplementing human decision-making with AI assistants would be the ideal and the most desirable outcome for maximising the micro- and macroeconomic benefits of the technology. This is what the leading AI firms seek to achieve as well. In his most recent blog, Sam Altman (the co-founder of OpenAI) stated that their intentions are to put 'great tools in the hands of people', with the goal of achieving broadly distributed outcomes 53 .  Similarly,  in  Alphabet  Inc.'s  2024  Q3  earnings  call,  the  CEO  of  Google stated that the company internally is using AI to augment their engineers' productivity by automating low level tasks, which allows their people to focus on more complex tasks 54 .\n\n13.53  Further,  factors  such  as  accountability,  an  understanding  of  the  subjective and  practical  realities  of  the  world,  consistently  adapting  reasoning,  cognisance  of\n\n50  Generative AI at work, NBER Working Paper 31161, November 2023, https://tinyurl.com/m2uzkkkt\n\n51    Charness,  G.,  Jabarian,  B.,  &amp;  List,  J.

Replacing  authentic,  intelligent  deliberation  with  a  brutal, calculative algorithm will result in a society where algorithms serve as an escape from reason, an excuse not to think. AI must be seen for and utilised as what it is supposed to be, a tool, as the arc of technological history does not bend towards the replacement of humans by machines.",
