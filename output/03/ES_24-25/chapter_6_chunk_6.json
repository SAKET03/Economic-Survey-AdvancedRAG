In FY25, capital expenditure gathered momentum post-elections, with a focus on sustainable construction practices and increasing private participation. The government has launched several initiatives, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), and PM-Gati Shakti, to promote infrastructure development. Key sectors such as railways, road transport, civil aviation, ports, and power have shown significant growth, with investments in physical connectivity, digital connectivity, and urban infrastructure. The chapter highlights the need for continued infrastructure investment, sustainable practices, and private participation to achieve India's growth objectives.\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Rural Infrastructure\n\n## RURAL INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n## Rural Drinking Water and Sanitation\n\n6.28 The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) aims to ensure long-term water security for rural households  by  providing  reliable  access  to  safe  piped  drinking  water.  When  it  was launched in August 2019, only 3.23 crore (17 per cent) of rural households had tap water connections. Since then, over 12.06 crore families have been added, increasing the total to more than 15.30 crore (79.1 per cent) out of approximately 19.34 crore rural households as of November 26, 2024. Eight states, namely, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Haryana,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Punjab,  Telangana  and  Mizoram,  and  three union territories, namely, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, Dadra Nagar Haveli &amp; Daman Diu and Puducherry have achieved 100 per cent coverage. There are 2,160 water quality laboratories, 1,570 of which are accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories, ensuring the safety of drinking water.\n\n## Box VI.11: Impact of Jal Jeevan Mission\n\nThe mission improved access to safe drinking water in rural areas, particularly in regions affected by water quality issues like arsenic and fluoride. Its impact includes better health outcomes and enhanced water security for vulnerable populations.\n\n- Coverage of quality-affected Areas: At the time of the launch of JJM, out of 19.4 crore  rural  households,  over  75.2  lakh  households  lived  in  quality-affected  areas  that lacked  safe  drinking  water.  Since  its  implementation,  69.23  lakh  rural  households  in quality-affected areas are getting safe piped water supply.\n- Arsenic-affected and fluoride-affected habitants: Arsenic-Affected and FluorideAffected  Habitants:  Safe  drinking  water  has  been  provided  to  more  than  23  lakh households in arsenic-affected habitations and 11.43 lakh households in fluoride-affected habitations.\n- Community Water Purification Plants (CWPPs): 618 CWPPs have been installed under JJM, out of which 573 are installed in arsenic and fluoride-affected areas.\n\n12    India Brand Equity Foundation (2024, October,01).

Phase II of SBM-G is implemented from 2020-21 to 2024-25, with a focus on converting the villages from ODF to ODF Plus.  An ODF plus progress is captured in three categories 14  namely aspiring, rising and model. The goal of SBM-G Phase-II is to make all the villages ODF Plus, i.e. 'Model Category'. An ODF Plus village in the model category is one that is sustaining its ODF status, plus having arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, observing visual cleanliness (minimal  litter,  minimal  stagnant  wastewater  and  no  plastic  waste  dump  in  public places) and displaying ODF plus information, education and communication messages. During April to November 2024, 1.92 lakh villages were incrementally declared ODF Plus under the model category, taking the total number of ODF Plus villages to 3.64 lakh.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6.30 State-wise progress of villages achieving ODF plus status is presented in Chart VI.17.  To highlight successful initiatives at the local level, two exemplary stories of waste management in Kerala and Madhya Pradesh are discussed in Box VI.12, demonstrating effective practices and impactful outcomes in these states.\n\n14     Note: Aspiring: Sustaining ODF status + arrangements for Solid or Liquid Waste Management; Rising: Sustaining ODF status + arrangements for both Solid and Liquid Waste Management; Model: Rising category + observes visual cleanliness i.e. minimal litter, minimal stagnant wastewater and no plastic waste dump in public places. Displays ODF Plus Information, Education and Communication messages.\n\n## Chart VI.17: Increasing number of villages achieving ODF plus status\n\n## As of 31 March 2024\n\n## As of 22 November 2024\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Ministry of Jal Shakti\n\nNote: Charts present 'Model' villages\n\n## Box VI.12:  Success stories of waste management initiatives\n\nModel of sustainable development and community empowerment in Erattayar Gram Panchayat, Idukki, Kerala :\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBy focusing on waste management, the Panchayat preserves the environment and creates jobs,  particularly  for  women.  The  strategy  involves  door-to-door  collection,  resource recovery, and recycling, reaching over 4,600 households and 500 institutions. Around 30 women are employed, earning an average of ₹10,000 monthly.\n\nDespite  initial  challenges  like  fee  collection  and  infrastructure  issues,  the  Panchayat's resilience has driven progress. With enhanced training and partnerships, waste management practices have improved. The Haritha Karma Sena, with 28 dedicated members, plays a crucial  role  in  this  effort,  collecting  user  fees  from  about  85  per  cent  of  households  and 90 per cent of institutions, generating approximately ₹2.5 lakh per month. Materials are meticulously segregated and sent to private agencies for further processing.\n\nThe Panchayat collects four tonnes of plastic and other non-biodegradable items monthly, adhering to a set schedule. This initiative not only fosters cleanliness but also empowers women, promoting inclusivity and gender equality. Erattayar Gram Panchayat's approach, emphasising  collaboration,  innovation,  and  empowerment,  sets  an  example  for  other communities striving for a greener, more equitable future.\n\n## Transforming Waste into Wealth: NADEP Composting, Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh\n\nThe Chhindwara district of Madhya  Pradesh has prioritised biodegradable waste management as part of SBM-G Phase 2, establishing waste management infrastructure in 784 Gram Panchayats and 1,898 villages, including 8,507 NADEP (a method of organic composting that produces fertiliser from organic materials) compost pits. However, due to improper usage of these pits as community dustbins, the district initiated a comprehensive Swachhata Drive from May 1 to June 30. This initiative focused on enhancing awareness and promoting sustainable practices among rural communities.\n\nCommunity  engagement  and  capacity-building  programmes  were  instrumental  in  the initiative's  success.  Extensive  outreach  efforts  educated  community  members  about  the benefits  of  composting,  while  targeted  training  programmmes  equipped  farmers  and stakeholders with the knowledge to manage organic waste effectively. These efforts ensured the appropriate utilisation of cow dung and organic waste in NADEP pits, facilitating the production of high-quality compost.\n\nThe  initiative witnessed  active participation  of  approximately  68,050  stakeholders, including  farmers,  PRI  members,  Swachhagrahis,  SHGs,  and  community  members, fostering significant improvements in waste segregation and management across villages. Each NADEP pit is projected to yield 500 kg of compost per cycle, generating an estimated income  of  ₹30,000  annually  for  farmers  through  three  composting  cycles.  This  shift  is expected  to  reduce  dependency  on  chemical  fertilisers,  decrease  costs,  and  enhance  soil health, supporting sustainable agricultural practices. Future plans include expanding the deployment of NADEP pits, ensuring their optimal use, and establishing market linkages for compost.",
