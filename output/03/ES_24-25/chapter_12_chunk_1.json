The unemployment rate has significantly declined, and labor force participation and worker population ratio have improved. Factory employment data reflects the manufacturing sector's resilience. To capitalize on the demographic dividend, creating quality jobs that offer sustainable livelihoods is crucial. The government aims to align the workforce with global demands by prioritizing reskilling, upskilling, and new-skilling.\\n\\nThe Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) reports a significant decline in the unemployment rate from 6% in 2017-18 to 3.2% in 2023-24. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) and worker-to-population ratio (WPR) have increased, with a broad-based recovery in employment levels across urban and rural areas. The urban unemployment rate has dropped from 6.6% in Q2 FY24 to 6.4% in Q2 FY25. The LFPR increased from 49.3% to 50.4%, and the WPR rose from 46% to 47.2% during the same period.\\n\\nThe proportion of self-employed workers in the workforce has risen from 52.2% in 2017-18 to 58.4% in 2023-24, reflecting growing entrepreneurial activity and a preference for flexible work arrangements. The share of workers in regular/salaried jobs decreased from 22.8% to 21.7%, while casual workers declined from 24.9% to 19.8%. Women's participation in the workforce has increased, with the female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) rising from 23.3% in 2017-18 to 41.7% in 2023-24.\\n\\nThe agriculture sector remains dominant in employment, with its share rising from 44.1% in 2017-18 to 46.1% in 2023-24. The share of female workers in agriculture increased from 57.0% to 64.4%, while male participation decreased from 40.2% to 36.3%. The government has launched initiatives such as Mudra Yojana, Skill India, Start-Up India, and Stand-Up India to foster entrepreneurship and provide skill training.\\n\\nThe average monthly earnings of workers vary across different segments, with regular wage/salaried workers and self-employed workers growing at a CAGR of 5% during 2018-19 to 2023-24. The daily wage of casual workers increased at a CAGR of 9% during the same period. Earnings for self-employed workers showed a dynamic trajectory, with a brief dip from 2017-18 to 2020-21, followed by a significant rebound post-pandemic.\\n\\nThe manufacturing sector has shown resilience, with a more than 7% increase in employment over the previous year. The sector added over 22 lakh jobs in FY23 over FY19. The number of large factories has grown, employing around 80% of total workers and 78% of total persons engaged. Formalization of the job market has increased, with net additions to EPFO subscriptions more than doubling from 61 lakh in FY19 to 131 lakh in FY24.\\n\\nThe government has formulated four Labour Codes to simplify labor laws and foster job creation. The Codes aim to strengthen workers' rights, including statutory minimum wage and timely payment, social security, occupational safety, and healthcare. The government has also launched the eShram portal to recognize unorganized workers and provide them with a Universal Account Number (UAN) and access to social security schemes.\\n\\nThe digital economy has significantly broadened job opportunities, encompassing roles from delivery personnel to software engineers and data analysts. The gig workforce is projected to reach 23.5 crore by 2029-30, comprising 6.7% of the non-agricultural workforce and 4.1% of total livelihoods. The digital economy offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gender gap and positively impact the gender structure of employment.\\n\\nThe renewable energy sector provides an opportunity for job creation, with an estimated 1.02 million jobs in India in 2023. The sector offers opportunities for women to enhance their participation in the labor market. The government has launched initiatives such as the Solar Urja Lamps project and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) to promote women's empowerment and job creation in the renewable energy sector.\\n\\nIndia's skilling and employment ecosystem is evolving, shaped by factors such as economic policies, technological advancements, and globalisation. The government has launched initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) and the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) to promote skill development and employment. The government has also announced a package of five key schemes aimed at benefiting 4.1 crore youth over five years with a central outlay of â‚¹2 lakh crore to promote employment and skilling.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# EMPLOYMENT AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT: EXISTENTIAL PRIORITIES\n\n## EMPLOYMENT AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT: EXISTENTIAL PRIORITIES\n\nCHAPTER\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12\n\nIndia's  labour  market indicators have experienced substantial improvements in  recent  years  driven  by  a  robust  post-pandemic  recovery  and  increased formalisation. According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey, the unemployment rate  has  significantly  declined  over  time,  alongside  positive  trends  in  labour force participation and the worker population ratio. Factory employment data further reflects the manufacturing sector's resilience.\n\nTo fully capitalise on the demographic dividend, it is well-recognised that creating quality jobs that offer sustainable livelihoods is crucial. Further, by prioritising reskilling, upskilling, and new-skilling, the government is aiming to align the workforce  with  global  demands,  enhancing  both  domestic  and  international employability.  Simplifying  compliances,  promoting  labour  flexibility,  and strengthening  workers'  welfare  are  vital  for  driving  sustainable  job  growth. Lowering  the  fixed  costs  of  doing  business  through  deregulation  will  create room for enterprises to hire more. To boost women's workforce participation, prioritising targeted skill development and providing entrepreneurial support is being pursued. Additionally, sectors like the digital economy and renewable energy offer vast potential for creating high-quality jobs, which is essential for achieving the Viksit Bharat's vision.",
