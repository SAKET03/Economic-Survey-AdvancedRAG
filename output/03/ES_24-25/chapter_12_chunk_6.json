The unemployment rate has significantly declined, and labor force participation and worker population ratio have improved. Factory employment data reflects the manufacturing sector's resilience. To capitalize on the demographic dividend, creating quality jobs that offer sustainable livelihoods is crucial. The government aims to align the workforce with global demands by prioritizing reskilling, upskilling, and new-skilling.\\n\\nThe Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) reports a significant decline in the unemployment rate from 6% in 2017-18 to 3.2% in 2023-24. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) and worker-to-population ratio (WPR) have increased, with a broad-based recovery in employment levels across urban and rural areas. The urban unemployment rate has dropped from 6.6% in Q2 FY24 to 6.4% in Q2 FY25. The LFPR increased from 49.3% to 50.4%, and the WPR rose from 46% to 47.2% during the same period.\\n\\nThe proportion of self-employed workers in the workforce has risen from 52.2% in 2017-18 to 58.4% in 2023-24, reflecting growing entrepreneurial activity and a preference for flexible work arrangements. The share of workers in regular/salaried jobs decreased from 22.8% to 21.7%, while casual workers declined from 24.9% to 19.8%. Women's participation in the workforce has increased, with the female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) rising from 23.3% in 2017-18 to 41.7% in 2023-24.\\n\\nThe agriculture sector remains dominant in employment, with its share rising from 44.1% in 2017-18 to 46.1% in 2023-24. The share of female workers in agriculture increased from 57.0% to 64.4%, while male participation decreased from 40.2% to 36.3%. The government has launched initiatives such as Mudra Yojana, Skill India, Start-Up India, and Stand-Up India to foster entrepreneurship and provide skill training.\\n\\nThe average monthly earnings of workers vary across different segments, with regular wage/salaried workers and self-employed workers growing at a CAGR of 5% during 2018-19 to 2023-24. The daily wage of casual workers increased at a CAGR of 9% during the same period. Earnings for self-employed workers showed a dynamic trajectory, with a brief dip from 2017-18 to 2020-21, followed by a significant rebound post-pandemic.\\n\\nThe manufacturing sector has shown resilience, with a more than 7% increase in employment over the previous year. The sector added over 22 lakh jobs in FY23 over FY19. The number of large factories has grown, employing around 80% of total workers and 78% of total persons engaged. Formalization of the job market has increased, with net additions to EPFO subscriptions more than doubling from 61 lakh in FY19 to 131 lakh in FY24.\\n\\nThe government has formulated four Labour Codes to simplify labor laws and foster job creation. The Codes aim to strengthen workers' rights, including statutory minimum wage and timely payment, social security, occupational safety, and healthcare. The government has also launched the eShram portal to recognize unorganized workers and provide them with a Universal Account Number (UAN) and access to social security schemes.\\n\\nThe digital economy has significantly broadened job opportunities, encompassing roles from delivery personnel to software engineers and data analysts. The gig workforce is projected to reach 23.5 crore by 2029-30, comprising 6.7% of the non-agricultural workforce and 4.1% of total livelihoods. The digital economy offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gender gap and positively impact the gender structure of employment.\\n\\nThe renewable energy sector provides an opportunity for job creation, with an estimated 1.02 million jobs in India in 2023. The sector offers opportunities for women to enhance their participation in the labor market. The government has launched initiatives such as the Solar Urja Lamps project and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) to promote women's empowerment and job creation in the renewable energy sector.\\n\\nIndia's skilling and employment ecosystem is evolving, shaped by factors such as economic policies, technological advancements, and globalisation. The government has launched initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) and the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) to promote skill development and employment. The government has also announced a package of five key schemes aimed at benefiting 4.1 crore youth over five years with a central outlay of â‚¹2 lakh crore to promote employment and skilling.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Conclusion\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n12.84. In conclusion, India has seen good growth in employment in recent years, as highlighted  by  labour  market  indicators  that  show  strong  signs  of  post-pandemic recovery and increased formalisation of the economy. This growth can be attributed to notable achievements in entrepreneurship, formalisation, skill development, and the transformation of the regulatory framework.\n\n12.85. Labour laws intended to protect the rights of women workers have, more often than  not,  discouraged  hiring  by  creating  systemic  barriers  to  their  entry  into  the workforce. India's new Labour Codes address this by enabling night shifts for women with safety measures, extending 26 weeks of maternity leave to gig and informal workers and mandating creche facilities in workplaces with 50 or more employees. The Codes ensure  equal  pay  and  prohibit  gender  discrimination  in  recruitment  while  allowing women to work in all sectors, including hazardous roles, with safeguards. These reforms will promote gender inclusivity, workplace safety, and social security for women.\n\n12.86. By simplifying compliance, fostering labour flexibility, and promoting worker welfare, labour reforms have created an enabling environment that balances ease of doing business with the protection of worker rights. Together, these measures foster a  'virtuous  cycle  of  job  creation,'  supporting  sustainable  employment  growth  and economic inclusivity. Chapter 5 of the survey 'Medium Term Outlook' discusses in detail the important role of deregulation in the economy. Deregulation, in general, whether or not related to labour, will boost employment because it helps lower the cost of doing business and allows for the resource to be used for expanding capacity through more labour and more and better equipment.\n\n******",
