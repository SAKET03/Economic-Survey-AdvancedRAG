The Global Trade Alert database reported over 26,000 new restrictions related to trade and investments globally between 2020 and 2024. Technical barriers to trade (TBT) affect 31.6% of product lines, covering 67.1% of global trade.\\n\\nThe European Union's (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) are expected to impact India's exports.

Total  exports  (merchandise  and services)  have  registered  a  steady  growth  in  the  first  nine  months  of  FY25, reaching USD 602.6 billion (6 per cent). Growth in services and goods exports, excluding petroleum and gems and jewellery, was 10.4 per cent. Total imports during the same period reached USD 682.2 billion, registering a growth of 6.9 per cent on the back of steady domestic demand.\n\nThe evolving global trade dynamics, marked by gradual shifts towards greater protectionism,  require  assessing  the  situation  and  developing  a  forwardlooking strategic trade roadmap. By adapting to these trends and leveraging its strengths, India can accelerate its growth and enhance its presence in global trade. To strengthen its competitiveness and further integrate into global supply chains, the country can focus on reducing trade-related costs and enhancing export  facilitation  to  create  a  more  vibrant  export  sector.  This  proactive approach will help India continue to thrive in an ever-changing global market.\n\nOn  the  capital  front,  foreign  portfolio  investments  (FPIs)  have  shown  a mixed  trend  in  FY25  so  far.  Uncertainty  in  the  global  markets  and  profittaking by foreign portfolio investors led to capital outflows. However, strong macroeconomic fundamentals, a  favourable  business  environment,  and  high economic  growth  have  kept  FPI  flows  positive  overall.  Gross  foreign  direct investment (FDI) inflows have shown signs of revival in the first eight months of FY25, though net FDI inflows declined relative to April-November 2023 due to a rise in repatriation/disinvestment.\n\nIndia's foreign exchange reserves stood at USD 640.3 billion as of the end of December 2024, sufficient to cover approximately 90 per cent of the country's external  debt  of  USD  711.8  billion  as  of  September  2024,  reflecting  a  strong buffer against external vulnerabilities.",
