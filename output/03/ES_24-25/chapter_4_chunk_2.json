  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nThe chapter discusses the dynamics of inflation, particularly in the context of India and the global economy. It highlights that global inflation peaked at 8.7% in 2022 due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions but has since declined. In India, retail inflation eased in FY25 due to government and Reserve Bank of India interventions, with core inflation reaching its lowest point in a decade. Food inflation remains a challenge, driven by supply chain disruptions, adverse weather conditions, and price pressures in vegetables and pulses. The chapter emphasizes the need for robust data systems, climate-resilient crops, and policy measures to ensure long-term price stability. Key statistics include: global inflation at 5.7% in 2024, India's retail inflation at 4.9% in FY25, food inflation at 4.3% when excluding vegetables and pulses, and the significant impact of extreme weather events on vegetable production and prices. The chapter concludes with policy recommendations to address inflationary pressures and ensure food security.\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Global Inflation\n\n## GLOBAL INFLATION\n\n## Global resilience amid synchronised monetary policy tightening\n\n4.4.  Despite the sharp and synchronised tightening of monetary policy across countries, the global economy has demonstrated an unusual level of resilience in output growth throughout the disinflationary process. This resilience is reflected in the steady decline of the headline inflation rate in most countries during FY24 and the current year. The concerted efforts by central banks to curb inflation through increased interest rates and other policy measures have yielded positive outcomes, resulting in a significant reduction in inflationary pressures.\n\n1  International Monetary Fund (2025, January) World Economic Outlook Update -Global growth : Divergent and Uncertain .

In alignment with the downward trend in headline inflation, core inflation, which excludes  volatile  food  and  energy  prices  has  also  decreased  in  most  countries.  The decline can be predominantly attributed to a moderation in international commodity prices.  This  trend  highlights  the  effectiveness  of  policy  interventions  in  stabilising prices across various sectors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Bloomberg and Consumer Price Indices released by CSO, MoSPI Note: *Inflation rate for FY25 is for April to December 2024, except for Japan, Malaysia and South Africa is until November 2024. ** Simple average of countries presented in chart IV.2.\n\n## Global food inflation eases with divergence in a few EMEs\n\n4.6.  Global food inflation is on a downward trend, aligning with the patterns observed in both headline and core inflation. Improving global supply conditions due to solid harvests  and  favourable  growing  conditions  contributed  to  the  softening  of  food prices 2 . However, some emerging economies, such as Brazil, India, and China have a contrasting pattern.\n\n<!-- image -->",
