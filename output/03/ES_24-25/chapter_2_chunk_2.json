  "content": "Chapter 2 Summary:\nIndia's monetary and financial sectors have performed well in the first nine months of FY25. Bank credit has grown steadily, converging towards deposit growth. Scheduled commercial banks' (SCBs) profitability has improved due to a fall in gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) and a rise in the capital-to-risk weighted asset ratio (CRAR). The Financial Inclusion Index increased from 53.9 in March 2021 to 64.2 in March 2024. Rural Financial Institutions (RFIs) and Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) have contributed significantly to financial inclusion and economic progress. The capital markets have demonstrated strong performance, driving capital formation and supporting wealth creation. The insurance and pension sectors continue to perform with the vision of achieving universal coverage. The financial sector is undergoing a transformative period marked by emerging trends such as an increase in consumer credit and equity-based financing. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5% and changed the policy stance from 'withdrawal of accommodation' to 'neutral'. The RBI also announced a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 4% to infuse liquidity into the banking system. The monetary base (M0) recorded a year-on-year growth of 3.6% as of January 3, 2025, while M3 growth was 9.3% as of December 27, 2024. The money multiplier (MM) stood at 5.7 as of December 27, 2024. The GNPA ratio of SCBs declined to a 12-year low of 2.6% at the end of September 2024. The restructured standard advances (RSA) ratio for SCBs declined from 1.8% to 0.7% at the end of September 2024. The CRAR of SCBs increased to 16.7% at the end of September 2024. The profitability of SCBs improved, with profit after tax surging by 22.2% in H1 of FY25. Bank deposits continue to exhibit double-digit growth, while credit growth has moderated to 11.8% as of November 2024. The growth in non-food credit was 7.5% compared to 11% in the same period last year. The credit/GDP ratio indicates that the recent growth in bank credit is sustainable. RFIs, including Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Rural Cooperative Banks (RCBs), and Small Finance Banks, play a vital role in ensuring inclusive growth through financial inclusion and credit accessibility. RRBs have expanded their reach, with 43 RRBs having 22,069 branches and operations extending to 31.3 crore deposit accounts and 3 crore loan accounts. The government approved ₹10,890 crore in recapitalisation assistance to RRBs during FY22 and FY23. DFIs, such as IIFCL and NaBFID, have supported infrastructure development and provided long-term funding for key sectors. IIFCL has sanctioned loans for over 780 projects with a total outlay of over ₹13.9 lakh crore. NaBFID has sanctioned ₹1.3 lakh crore loans as of September 30, 2024, with a target of sanctioning over ₹3 lakh crore by the end of FY26. Banks have adapted to the latest technological innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to redefine customer interactions and enhance decision-making speed and accuracy.\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Monetary Developments\n\n## MONETARY DEVELOPMENTS\n\n2.3 The primary objective of monetary policy is to maintain price stability while also considering the goal of economic growth, as stable prices are essential for sustainable growth. The RBI employs various policy instruments, such as manoeuvring the interest rates, conducting open market operations (OMO), altering the cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR), etc, to achieve this stability.\n\n2.4 During the first nine months of FY25 (April 2024-December 2024), the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the RBI, in its various meetings, decided to keep the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent. Until its August 2024 meeting, the committee retained its stance on the 'withdrawal of accommodation' to ensure inflation aligns with the target while supporting growth. Considering the prevailing and expected inflationgrowth dynamics, the committee, in its October 2024 meeting, decided to change the policy  stance  from  the  'withdrawal  of  accommodation'  to  'neutral'.  In  its  December 2024 meeting, the MPC announced a cut in CRR to 4 per cent of the net demand and\n\ntime liabilities (NDTL) from 4.5 per cent. The decision is expected to infuse around ₹1.16 lakh crore liquidity in the banking system. 1\n\n2.5 Examining the trend in various measures of money supply in the economy, viz., different aggregates that reflect varying degrees of liquidity, it is seen that the monetary base, viz. the most liquid form of money, M0, recorded a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 3.6 per cent as of 3 January 2025, compared to 6.3 per cent a year ago. The growth in M3, excluding the impact of the merger of a non-bank with a bank (with effect from 1 July 2023), was 9.3 per cent (YoY) as of 27 December 2024, compared to 11 per cent a year ago. Component-wise 2 , aggregate deposits were the most significant component and contributed most to the expansion of M3. Amongst sources 3 , bank credit to the commercial sector was a major contributor to the increase in M3. As of 27 December 2024, MM 4 , i.e., the ratio of M3 to M0, stood at 5.7 against 5.5 a year ago. Adjusted for reverse repo amounts, analytically akin to banks' deposits with the central bank, the adjusted MM was lower at 5.6 as of 27 December 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource:  Money  Stock:  Components  and  Sources,  Publications,  Weekly  Statistical  Supplement,  RBI  Reserve Money: Components and Sources, Publications, Weekly Statistical Supplement, RBI\n\n1 RBI press  release  dated  6  December  2024,  'Maintenance  of  Cash  Reserve  Ratio  (CRR),  https://tinyurl.com/ pxkhxndd.\n\n2  Components of Broad Money=Currency with the Public + Aggregate Deposits (Demand Deposits with Banks + Time Deposits with banks + 'Other' deposits with Reserve Bank).\n\n3  Sources of Broad Money=Net Bank Credit to Government + Bank Credit to Commercial Sector + Net Foreign Exchange Assets of Banking Sector + Government's Currency Liabilities to the Public- Banking Sector's Net NonMonetary Liabilities).\n\n4  The money multiplier measures the maximum amount of money that a banking system generates with each unit of central bank money.\n\n2.6 A country's MM is influenced by two main factors: - the amount of cash individuals (and businesses) hold and the reserves that banks maintain. When individuals keep more cash, the banking system cannot create money, resulting in a lower multiplier. In this case, cash in hand acts as a leakage from the banking system. Similarly, the reserves that banks hold with the central bank also count as a leakage, further decreasing the MM. In India's case, banks hold a portion of their deposits as reserves with the RBI, known as CRR.\n\n2.7 A higher MM indicates that the banking system is generating a greater money supply from the money provided by the central bank. In India, recent efforts to promote financial inclusion have encouraged people to hold less cash in hand relative to their deposits, which partly explains the increase in the MM. Chart II.2 shows that MM has been on an upward trend over the years. It declined during the COVID-19 pandemic as increased economic uncertainty caused individuals to increase their cash holdings, resulting in a fall. However, after FY22, it has resumed its upward trajectory, reflecting enhanced liquidity generation in the economy.\n\n<!-- image -->",
