In this context, as policymakers, it is important to pay attention to the evolving technological  landscape  and  the  potential  impact  it  can  have  on  the  labour market.  Historical  parallels  with  earlier  technological  revolutions  reveal  the critical  role  of  inclusive  institutions  in  managing  disruption  and  ensuring equitable outcomes.\n\nBarriers  to  large-scale  AI  adoption  persist  in  the  present,  which  include concerns  over  reliability,  resource  inefficiencies,  and  infrastructure  deficits. These  challenges,  along  with  AI's  experimental  nature,  create  a  window  for policymakers  to  act.  India's  demographic  advantage  and  diverse  economic landscape  position  it  uniquely  to  benefit  from  AI.  However,  achieving  these benefits requires significant investments in education and workforce skilling, supported by enabling, insuring, and stewarding institutions. These mechanisms can help workers adapt to changing demands while providing essential safety nets.\n\nBy  fostering  collaboration  between  policymakers,  the  private  sector,  and academia, India can align AI-driven innovation with societal goals. Ensuring inclusivity and sustainability in this transition is key to maximizing benefits while minimizing  disruptions.  With  robust  institutional  frameworks  and  strategic planning, AI can serve not as a crisis but as a catalyst for equitable economic transformation, positioning India to thrive in an increasingly automated world.",
