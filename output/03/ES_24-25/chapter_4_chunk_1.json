  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nThe chapter discusses the dynamics of inflation, particularly in the context of India and the global economy. It highlights that global inflation peaked at 8.7% in 2022 due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions but has since declined. In India, retail inflation eased in FY25 due to government and Reserve Bank of India interventions, with core inflation reaching its lowest point in a decade. Food inflation remains a challenge, driven by supply chain disruptions, adverse weather conditions, and price pressures in vegetables and pulses. The chapter emphasizes the need for robust data systems, climate-resilient crops, and policy measures to ensure long-term price stability. Key statistics include: global inflation at 5.7% in 2024, India's retail inflation at 4.9% in FY25, food inflation at 4.3% when excluding vegetables and pulses, and the significant impact of extreme weather events on vegetable production and prices. The chapter concludes with policy recommendations to address inflationary pressures and ensure food security.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n4.1.  In the ever-evolving landscape of global economics, understanding the dynamics of inflation is crucial. The persistent inflationary pressures pose several challenges for policymakers and the general public. On the global front, central banks are cautiously unwinding their restrictive policies to balance inflation control with economic recovery. In India, the various government initiatives and monetary policy reviews are helping to keep inflationary pressure at check.\n\n- 4.2.  Global inflation peaked at 8.7 per cent in 2022, driven by supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, to 5.7 per cent in 2024 1 . In India, retail inflation moderated from 5.4 per cent in FY24 to 4.9 per cent in FY25 (April-December) despite challenging food price dynamics. Food items constitute about two-fifths of the consumer price index in India. Hence, the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) is a significant determinant of retail inflation. In recent years, food inflation has been a major contributor to headline inflation. However, an increase in prices is not widespread across all food categories. It is primarily driven by a few items.\n- 4.3.  Given this context, the chapter is organised into four sections. Section 2 analyse the global inflation, while Section 3 examines the domestic inflation trends and discusses the proximate factors affecting inflation dynamics. The chapter concludes with a set of  recommendations in Section 4. The idea behind this presentation plan is to give an overview about inflation dynamics to policymakers and stakeholders to help them navigate the complexities of managing inflation.",
