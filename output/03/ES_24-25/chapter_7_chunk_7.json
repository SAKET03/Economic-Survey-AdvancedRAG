  "content": "Chapter 7 Summary:\nThe global manufacturing landscape has undergone significant shifts over the past decade, with India gaining a greater presence. A strategic emphasis on public capital formation and logistic improvements has underpinned this achievement. However, challenges such as geopolitical tensions, aggressive industrial and trade policies, supply chain disruptions, and global trade slowdown have posed a challenge to export demand for India's manufactured products. Industries like steel, cement, chemicals, and petrochemicals have stabilized industrial growth, while consumer-focused sectors like automobiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals have emerged as growth drivers. To drive growth, fostering R&D investments, innovations, and enhancing the growth and formalization of smaller manufacturers will be crucial. State-level analysis indicates that business reforms in states are likely to foster industrial development. India needs sustained and coordinated efforts from all tiers of government, the private sector, the skilling ecosystem, academia, and R&D institutions to become a strong manufacturing power. The global manufacturing space has seen high-income countries lose a significant part of their share over the last decade, mainly gained by upper-middle-income countries, particularly China. India has a large opportunity to climb up the ladder, with 2.8% of the global share in manufacturing compared to China's 28.8%. India also has a substantial scope to improve the contribution of the industrial sector in GDP. The IMF observes that manufacturing production is increasingly shifting towards emerging market economies, particularly China and India. India stands a good chance of benefiting from the trends in global industrial diversification. The industrial sector was significantly affected by the pandemic, leading to a contraction in FY21, but growth fluctuations have been seen in subsequent years. Industrial growth has declined to 3.6% in Q2 of FY25 due to factors like manufacturing exports slowdown, monsoon impacts, and statistical downward bias in growth figures. Core input industries like cement, steel, and chemicals have shown growth, with cement production at around 427 million tonnes in FY24 and steel production registering a growth of 3.3% and 4.6% in April-November of FY25. The chemical and petrochemical sector's share in GVA of the manufacturing sector was 9.5% during FY23. The capital goods sector has shown robust growth, with the production of capital goods fluctuating between FY20 and FY23 before recording growth in FY24. The automobile industry has recorded domestic sales growth of 12.5% in FY24, and the electronics industry has seen significant growth, with domestic production increasing from ₹1.90 lakh crore in FY15 to ₹9.52 lakh crore in FY24. The pharmaceutical industry is the world's third-largest by volume, with a diverse product portfolio and strong global presence. India's R&D ecosystem has shown improvement, with patent filings increasing, and the country ranking sixth among the top 10 patent filing offices globally. However, India lags in R&D, with a significant gap across major sectors, and the gross expenditure on research & development (GERD) in India has increased from approximately ₹60,196 crore in FY11 to about ₹127,381 crore in FY21. The MSME sector plays a crucial role in India's progress, employing 23.24 crore individuals as of November 2024. The government has launched initiatives like the Udyam Registration Portal and the Udyam Assist Platform to simplify the process of registering MSMEs and enable ease of doing business. To facilitate credit to MSMEs, a revamp of the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) was undertaken with ₹9,000 crore in the corpus of the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for MSEs. The government has also launched the Self-Reliant India (SRI) Fund with a corpus of ₹50,000 crore to provide equity funding to MSMEs with the potential to scale up. Developmental disparities across states have always been a matter of keen attention, bringing convergence of per capita incomes and living standards to policy focus. Four states - Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu - account for about 43% of the total industrial GSVA. There is a need for focus on industrial strategies appropriate to unique geographies like the North East. Research papers highlight that state-level policies play a crucial role in shaping the economic growth patterns across Indian states. The Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) formulated by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade aims to assess and enhance the ease of doing business across states. A close connection between industrial and service sectors is indicated by the increasing 'servicification' of industrial output and exports. States should focus on business reforms on a priority basis to achieve buoyancies in some industrial or service sectors where it has natural advantages.\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Conclusion and Outlook\n\n## CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK\n\n7.55  Economic Survey 2023-24, released in July 2024, reported that:\n\n- i.    Over the last decade, output shares were realigned among industrial segments in favour of sectors like chemicals, wood products and furniture, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, steel and machinery and equipment.\n- ii.    Import dependency in key sectors like coal, capital goods and chemicals continues. Global uncertainties may constrain export demand and affect the domestic cost of production by influencing the prices of import-intensive raw materials.\n\n38    Is  Service  Orientation  Benefitting  Manufacturing  Exports  from  Low-Middle  Income  Countries?  Firm-level Empirical Evidence from WBES Data Sonia Pant and Debashis Chakraborty, 2024.\n\n- iii.    The  path  to  further  industrialisation  is  paved  with  deregulation,  R&amp;D  and, innovation and improving the skill levels of the workforce. Commitment to R&amp;D must be in the DNA of the industry, independent of any fiscal incentive since it is about global competitiveness and profitability.\n- iv.    Sectors with widely scattered production units, like textiles, and the MSME sector in general, seek support systems to develop projects and ensure finance, easier compliance, and grassroots-level facilitation to ensure market access.\n\n7.56  The foregoing analysis supports and reinforces these conclusions and suggestions, particularly strongly in the following respects.\n\n- i.    The  first  is  the  connection  between  the  uncertain  and  unsupportive  global environment  and  the  Indian  industry.  There  was  a  manufacturing  growth deceleration in H1 FY25. A part of it was due to seasonal causes like the alignment of  festivities  and  monsoon-related  disturbances.  Slackening  global  trade  and aggressive trade and industrial policies of many major economies have affected manufacturing and investment by the private sector. However, business surveys and purchasing managers' index point to improving optimism. The way ahead lies in vigorous focus on deregulation, R&amp;D, appropriate skilling and employment strategies, and targeted support for smaller enterprises.  This will improve the competitiveness of the Indian industry and prepare it to weather global challenges.\n- ii.    The brief State-wise analysis presented in this Chapter reveals that they are vastly different in their industrial strengths, weaknesses and accomplishments. It also highlighted that the state of business regulations and reforms varied across States, and these differences are closely related to their industrial progress or the lack of it. This reiterates the need for appropriate business reforms at the grassroots level.\n\n7.57  Hence, as noted in the Chapter, in a rather unsupportive global environment, it calls for lasting, synchronised efforts of all tiers of governments, the private sector, the skilling eco-system, academia and R&amp;D institutions, as well, and financial stakeholders to enable India realise its ambition as a manufacturing powerhouse.",
