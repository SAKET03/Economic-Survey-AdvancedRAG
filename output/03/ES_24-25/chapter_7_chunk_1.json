India has been one of the dynamic economies that gained greater presence  in  the  space  gradually  vacated  by  developed  countries.  A  strategic emphasis  on  public  capital  formation  and  significant  logistic  improvements has  underpinned  this  achievement.  Lately,  however,  there  have  been  serious challenges to global manufacturing in terms of persistent geopolitical tensions, aggressive industrial and trade policies, supply chain disruptions, and global trade  slowdown.  This  has  posed  a  challenge  to  export  demand  for  India's manufactured products.\n\nIndustries such as steel, cement, chemicals, and petrochemicals have stabilised industrial growth, while consumer-focused sectors like automobiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals have emerged as growth drivers. As we progress,  fostering R&amp;D  investments,  innovations,  enhancing  the  growth  and  formalisation  of smaller manufacturers will drive growth across various sectors.\n\nState-level analysis indicates that business reforms in states are likely to foster industrial  development.  Achieving  India's  ambition  of  becoming  a  strong manufacturing power necessitates sustained and coordinated efforts from all tiers of government, the private sector, the skilling ecosystem, academia and R&amp;D institutions.\n\n##",
