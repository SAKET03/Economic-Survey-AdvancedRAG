  "content": "Chapter 9 Summary:\nThe agricultural sector in India has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23. The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, providing a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) to develop and conserve natural resources alongside farming systems. The agricultural sector faces challenges such as climate change, water scarcity, and soil degradation, which require focused and targeted interventions. The sector's growth potential is significant, with opportunities for agro-based entrepreneurship and employment generation. The government has launched several initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). The food processing industry is also a critical sector, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The sector's growth is crucial for ensuring food security and achieving sustainable development goals.\n\nSubchapter 8 Content:\n# Agriculture Extension: The Enabler\n\n## AGRICULTURE EXTENSION: The Enabler\n\n9.31 Agricultural extension is vital in disseminating knowledge, enhancing productivity,  and  promoting  sustainable  agricultural  practices.  The  government is  implementing  the  Sub-Mission  on  Agricultural  Extension  (SMAE)  to  bolster agricultural extension services, enhance entrepreneurship and improve productivity in the agricultural sector throughout India. A key component of the SMAE is the support provided by the Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA), which focuses on  sharing  the  latest  agricultural  technologies  to  boost  production.  The  initiatives include farmer training, demonstrations, exposure visits, kisan melas, mobilisation of farmer groups, and the establishment of farm schools. During the FY24 period, over 3.66 million farmers benefitted from these extension activities, with an additional 4.49 million having availed themselves of these benefits by November 2024. Furthermore, the government has launched the short duration skill training of rural youth scheme to offer short-term skill training to rural youth and farmers in agriculture and related fields. So far, 20940 candidates were trained as of November 2024 of which 5504 were trained in FY25. To address the training needs of middle-level field extension workers, the government has established four regional extension education institutes located in  Haryana, Telangana, Gujarat, and Assam. During FY24, 8,175 extension workers underwent training, with an additional 2,195 trained by November 2024. In addition to training programs, the government operates the Kisan Call Centre to address farmers' queries regarding agriculture and allied sectors. Responses to these queries are provided in 22 official languages from 17 locations nationwide.",
