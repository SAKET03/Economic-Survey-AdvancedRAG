  "content": "Chapter 7 Summary:\nThe global manufacturing landscape has undergone significant shifts over the past decade, with India gaining a greater presence. A strategic emphasis on public capital formation and logistic improvements has underpinned this achievement. However, challenges such as geopolitical tensions, aggressive industrial and trade policies, supply chain disruptions, and global trade slowdown have posed a challenge to export demand for India's manufactured products. Industries like steel, cement, chemicals, and petrochemicals have stabilized industrial growth, while consumer-focused sectors like automobiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals have emerged as growth drivers. To drive growth, fostering R&D investments, innovations, and enhancing the growth and formalization of smaller manufacturers will be crucial. State-level analysis indicates that business reforms in states are likely to foster industrial development. India needs sustained and coordinated efforts from all tiers of government, the private sector, the skilling ecosystem, academia, and R&D institutions to become a strong manufacturing power. The global manufacturing space has seen high-income countries lose a significant part of their share over the last decade, mainly gained by upper-middle-income countries, particularly China. India has a large opportunity to climb up the ladder, with 2.8% of the global share in manufacturing compared to China's 28.8%. India also has a substantial scope to improve the contribution of the industrial sector in GDP. The IMF observes that manufacturing production is increasingly shifting towards emerging market economies, particularly China and India. India stands a good chance of benefiting from the trends in global industrial diversification. The industrial sector was significantly affected by the pandemic, leading to a contraction in FY21, but growth fluctuations have been seen in subsequent years. Industrial growth has declined to 3.6% in Q2 of FY25 due to factors like manufacturing exports slowdown, monsoon impacts, and statistical downward bias in growth figures. Core input industries like cement, steel, and chemicals have shown growth, with cement production at around 427 million tonnes in FY24 and steel production registering a growth of 3.3% and 4.6% in April-November of FY25. The chemical and petrochemical sector's share in GVA of the manufacturing sector was 9.5% during FY23. The capital goods sector has shown robust growth, with the production of capital goods fluctuating between FY20 and FY23 before recording growth in FY24. The automobile industry has recorded domestic sales growth of 12.5% in FY24, and the electronics industry has seen significant growth, with domestic production increasing from ₹1.90 lakh crore in FY15 to ₹9.52 lakh crore in FY24. The pharmaceutical industry is the world's third-largest by volume, with a diverse product portfolio and strong global presence. India's R&D ecosystem has shown improvement, with patent filings increasing, and the country ranking sixth among the top 10 patent filing offices globally. However, India lags in R&D, with a significant gap across major sectors, and the gross expenditure on research & development (GERD) in India has increased from approximately ₹60,196 crore in FY11 to about ₹127,381 crore in FY21. The MSME sector plays a crucial role in India's progress, employing 23.24 crore individuals as of November 2024. The government has launched initiatives like the Udyam Registration Portal and the Udyam Assist Platform to simplify the process of registering MSMEs and enable ease of doing business. To facilitate credit to MSMEs, a revamp of the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) was undertaken with ₹9,000 crore in the corpus of the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for MSEs. The government has also launched the Self-Reliant India (SRI) Fund with a corpus of ₹50,000 crore to provide equity funding to MSMEs with the potential to scale up. Developmental disparities across states have always been a matter of keen attention, bringing convergence of per capita incomes and living standards to policy focus. Four states - Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu - account for about 43% of the total industrial GSVA. There is a need for focus on industrial strategies appropriate to unique geographies like the North East. Research papers highlight that state-level policies play a crucial role in shaping the economic growth patterns across Indian states. The Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) formulated by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade aims to assess and enhance the ease of doing business across states. A close connection between industrial and service sectors is indicated by the increasing 'servicification' of industrial output and exports. States should focus on business reforms on a priority basis to achieve buoyancies in some industrial or service sectors where it has natural advantages.\n\nSubchapter 3 Content:\n# Recent Domestic Developments\n\n## RECENT DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS\n\n7.5 The  industrial  sector  (including  four  sub-sectors,  i.e.,  mining  and  quarrying; electricity,  gas,  water  supply  and  utilities;  manufacturing  and  construction)  was affected significantly by the pandemic, leading to a contraction in FY21. This led to growth fluctuations in subsequent years. Hence, comparing FY25 with an average of the previous five years, including the pre-pandemic FY20, is appropriate. Chart VII.2(a) shows that the industrial growth in FY25 is expected higher than the previous five-year average.  The industrial sector grew by 6.2 per cent in FY25, driven by robust growth in electricity and construction.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n7.6 However, industrial growth has declined to 3.6 per cent in the second quarter (Q2) of FY25 on account of three major factors.  Firstly, manufacturing exports experienced a sharp slowdown due to economic challenges in destination countries and intensified trade  competition  and  industrial  policies  followed  by  many  major  trading  nations. Secondly,  the  unprecedented  levels  of  monsoon  produced  mixed  impacts.  While  it helped replenish reservoirs and boost farming operations, it also slowed down activities like mining, construction and, to an extent, manufacturing. Thirdly, the variation in the timing of festivals between September and October in the previous and current years contributed to a slight statistical downward bias in the growth figures for Q2 as festivals drive higher consumer spending and economic activity. Festival sales of select consumer items, including automobiles, picked up in October.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7.7 The  remaining  sections  of  the  chapter  are  organised  as  follows.  The  next  two sections review the progress, challenges, and policy measures across various industrial segments, including core industrial input industries and capital and consumer goods sectors.  This is followed by a brief discussion on over-arching themes like research and development and micro, small and medium enterprises. The state-level variations in the degree of industrialisation and the scope for progress are examined in the following section. The last section concludes the discussions and presents a way ahead.",
