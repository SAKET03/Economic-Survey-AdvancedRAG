  "content": "Chapter 10 Summary:\nIndia aims to achieve robust economic growth and become a developed nation by 2047 with inclusive and sustainable development. The country has low per capita carbon emissions but faces challenges in deploying renewable energy due to a lack of storage technology and access to minerals. A strong adaptation strategy is essential given India's vulnerability to climate change. The increase in adaptation expenditures from 3.7% to 5.6% of GDP between FY16 and FY22 indicates the prominence of adaptation and building resilience in the development strategy. The Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) initiative aims to encourage sustainable practices and a circular economy. International finance for climate action remains inadequate. India's per capita carbon emissions are one-third of the global average. The country is committed to low-carbon growth but faces trade-offs in achieving this goal. A fundamental shift in mindset and behavior towards mindful consumption and production is necessary. The LiFE initiative and circular economy are crucial for sustainable development. The country needs to balance growth with environmental concerns. The chapter discusses India's climate change vulnerability, adaptation measures, and energy transition. It highlights the need for a low-carbon development pathway and the challenges associated with it. The chapter also covers the LiFE initiative, circular economy, and resource efficiency measures. India's climate efforts are anchored in its commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. The country aims to become a developed nation by 2047 while ensuring low-carbon development. A delicate balance between growth and environmental concerns is necessary. Mitigation and adaptation strategies are crucial for India's growth strategy. The chapter provides an overview of India's climate change challenges and opportunities.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT: ADAPTATION MATTERS\n\n## CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT: ADAPTATION MATTERS\n\nCHAPTER\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10\n\nIndia  needs  to  achieve  robust  economic  growth  to  attain  developed  nation status by 2047, with a focus on inclusive and sustainable development. While the country has low per capita carbon emissions, it is committed to pursuing low-carbon  growth.  However,  it  faces  challenges  in  deploying  renewable energy, particularly due to a lack of storage technology and access to minerals. Given  India's  vulnerability  to  climate  change,  a  strong  adaptation  strategy is  essential;  the  increase  in  adaptation  expenditures  from  3.7  per  cent  to  5.6 per cent of GDP between FY16 and FY22 indicates the prominence adaptation and  building  resilience  play  in  the  development  strategy.  The  Lifestyle  for Environment (LiFE) initiative, designed to encourage sustainable practices and circular economy, will play a transformative role in the development process. The flow of international finance has remained grossly inadequate, with much of the action being financed from domestic resources. The outcomes from the recent CoP29 hold little promise on that account.",
