Scheduled commercial banks' (SCBs) profitability has improved due to a fall in gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) and a rise in the capital-to-risk weighted asset ratio (CRAR). The Financial Inclusion Index increased from 53.9 in March 2021 to 64.2 in March 2024. Rural Financial Institutions (RFIs) and Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) have contributed significantly to financial inclusion and economic progress. The capital markets have demonstrated strong performance, driving capital formation and supporting wealth creation. The insurance and pension sectors continue to perform with the vision of achieving universal coverage. The financial sector is undergoing a transformative period marked by emerging trends such as an increase in consumer credit and equity-based financing. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5% and changed the policy stance from 'withdrawal of accommodation' to 'neutral'. The RBI also announced a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 4% to infuse liquidity into the banking system. The monetary base (M0) recorded a year-on-year growth of 3.6% as of January 3, 2025, while M3 growth was 9.3% as of December 27, 2024. The money multiplier (MM) stood at 5.7 as of December 27, 2024. The GNPA ratio of SCBs declined to a 12-year low of 2.6% at the end of September 2024. The restructured standard advances (RSA) ratio for SCBs declined from 1.8% to 0.7% at the end of September 2024. The CRAR of SCBs increased to 16.7% at the end of September 2024. The profitability of SCBs improved, with profit after tax surging by 22.2% in H1 of FY25. Bank deposits continue to exhibit double-digit growth, while credit growth has moderated to 11.8% as of November 2024. The growth in non-food credit was 7.5% compared to 11% in the same period last year. The credit/GDP ratio indicates that the recent growth in bank credit is sustainable. RFIs, including Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Rural Cooperative Banks (RCBs), and Small Finance Banks, play a vital role in ensuring inclusive growth through financial inclusion and credit accessibility. RRBs have expanded their reach, with 43 RRBs having 22,069 branches and operations extending to 31.3 crore deposit accounts and 3 crore loan accounts. The government approved ₹10,890 crore in recapitalisation assistance to RRBs during FY22 and FY23. DFIs, such as IIFCL and NaBFID, have supported infrastructure development and provided long-term funding for key sectors. IIFCL has sanctioned loans for over 780 projects with a total outlay of over ₹13.9 lakh crore. NaBFID has sanctioned ₹1.3 lakh crore loans as of September 30, 2024, with a target of sanctioning over ₹3 lakh crore by the end of FY26. Banks have adapted to the latest technological innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to redefine customer interactions and enhance decision-making speed and accuracy.\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Outlook\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\n2.88   India's  financial  sector  has  performed  well  amidst  unfavourable  geopolitical conditions. On the monetary front, system liquidity, represented by the net position under the Liquidity Adjustment Facility, remained in surplus during October-November 2024. The financial parameters of banks continue to be strong, reflected in improved profitability indicators. The gap between the growth of credit and deposits of SCBs has\n\n104    Carstens, A.

Capital markets significantly contribute to capital formation, the financialisation of domestic savings, and wealth creation. Strong macroeconomic fundamentals, healthy corporate earnings, supportive institutional  investment,  robust  inflows  from  SIPs,  and  increased  formalisation, digitisation, and accessibility have all fuelled the market's continued growth. India's insurance  sector  is  performing  well  and  is  projected  to  become  the  fastest-growing market among G20 nations over the next five years (2024-2028). The pension sector is expected to grow as the economy transitions from a lower-middle-income to an uppermiddle-income country.\n\n2.89  The financial sector is witnessing a moment of positive flux, with several changes taking shape. Firstly, there is a rise in the share of consumer credit in overall credit extended by banks. 105   Between FY14 and FY24, the share of consumer credit in total bank credit increased from 18.3 per cent to 32.4 per cent. 106  Secondly, there has been a rise in non-bank-based financing in recent years. Banks' share in total credit has declined from 77 per cent in FY11 to 58 per cent in FY22. 107  Simultaneously, there has been a rise in NBFCs and bond market financing. Thirdly, equity-based financing has catapulted to popularity, with IPO listings growing six times between FY13 and FY24 and India being ranked first globally in terms of the number of IPO listings in FY24. 108 Young investors are also driving the equity boom under the age of 30. As a report by the NSE notes that between March 2018 to September 2024, the proportion of young investors surged from 23 per cent to 40 per cent. 109\n\n2.90  These emerging trends mark the dawn of a new era for India's financial sector. However,  they  also  bring  regulatory  challenges  and  potential  risks  that  cannot be  overlooked.  One  critical  risk  to  guard  against  is  the  dominance  of  financial markets  in  shaping  policy  and  macroeconomic  outcomes,  a  phenomenon  known as  'financialisation.'  The  consequences  of  financialisation  are  evident  in  advanced economies, where it has led to unprecedented levels of public and private sector debtsome visible to regulators and some not. Economic growth in such contexts becomes overly reliant on rising asset prices to offset leverage, exacerbating inequality and asset  market  considerations  that  may  overly  influence  public  policies,  particularly regulatory  ones.  As  India  strives  to  align  its  financial  system  with  its  economic aspirations for 2047, she should strive to maintain the fine balance between financial\n\n105    Sengupta, R., &amp; Vardhan, H.

It means that the country has to chart its path with respect to its context, considering the levels of financial savings in households, its investment needs, and levels of financial literacy.  Ensuring  that  incentives  in  the  sector  are  consistent  with  national  growth aspirations is a policy imperative.\n\n******",
