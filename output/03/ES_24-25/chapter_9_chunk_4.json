  "content": "Chapter 9 Summary:\nThe agricultural sector in India has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23. The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, providing a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) to develop and conserve natural resources alongside farming systems. The agricultural sector faces challenges such as climate change, water scarcity, and soil degradation, which require focused and targeted interventions. The sector's growth potential is significant, with opportunities for agro-based entrepreneurship and employment generation. The government has launched several initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). The food processing industry is also a critical sector, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The sector's growth is crucial for ensuring food security and achieving sustainable development goals.\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Seeds-Quality and Use of Fertilisers: The Critical Differentiator\n\n## SEEDS-QUALITY AND USE OF FERTILISERS: The Critical Differentiator\n\n9.12 The adage 'As you sow, so shall you reap' effectively reflects the significance of seed quality and the accessibility of seeds in sufficient quantities by farmers in promoting healthy crop growth. In the 2023-24 season, ICAR produced 1.06 lakh quintals of breeder seeds encompassing 1,798 varieties across 81 crops for further multiplication. Given the impact of weather on agricultural output, research into climate-resistant seeds has become a priority, with 2,177 of the 2,593 new varieties released since 2014 specifically addressing this challenge. To ensure that these varieties are readily available, seed banks have been established. In regions such as north-western India, heat-tolerant wheat varieties have seen widespread adoption to alleviate the effects of heat stress. In FY24, demonstrations of climate-resilient technology packages were conducted in 121 vulnerable districts under the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture initiative.\n\n9.13 Soil  degradation,  particularly  the  decline  in  organic  carbon  content,  poses a  significant  challenge  to  Indian  agriculture.  Many  soils  in  India  are  deficient  in organic  carbon,  macronutrients,  and  essential  micronutrients  such  as  boron,  iron, and sulphur. This deterioration of soil health adversely affects fertility, productivity, and overall agricultural sustainability. To achieve optimal crop yields while ensuring environmental  sustainability,  it  is  imperative  to  use  fertilisers  judiciously.  Recently introduced, 'Urea Gold' combines urea with sulphur, minimizing wastage and enhancing plant nutrient uptake. Additionally, the use of drones and fertigation 12   techniques are being implemented to optimize fertiliser applications. The Programme for Restoration, Awareness  Generation,  Nourishment,  and  Amelioration  of  Mother  Earth  (PMPRANAM) initiative incentivises states to adopt alternative fertilisers  such  as  Nano Urea, Nano Diammonium phosphate (DAP), and organic fertilisers. By promoting these sustainable options, the government aims to improve soil health, reduce environmental pollution, and boost agricultural productivity.",
