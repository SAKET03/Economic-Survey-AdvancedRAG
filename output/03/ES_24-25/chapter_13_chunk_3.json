The International Monetary Fund states that AI poses risks of job displacements, notably for emerging markets and developing economies, which are not well placed to leverage the technology relative to the advanced economies 9 . The International Labour Organisation estimates that nearly 75 million jobs globally are at complete risk of automation due to AI 10 . Estimates for the UK show that 7 per cent of the existing UK jobs face a high risk of automation in the near term, rising to around 18 per cent after 10 years 11 .  Industry experts have told media outlets that 'AI models could dramatically disrupt the labour market, including replacing routine jobs in some sectors. 12 ' A study by the Bank for International Settlements finds that 45 per cent of the  jobs  in  the  upper  quartile  of  the  wage  distribution  remain  exposed  to  AI  in  the United States. If AI becomes highly capable, exposure increases across all quartiles of the income distribution 13 .\n\n13.10 Estimates  from  private  sector  firms  paint  a  similar  picture.  Goldman  Sachs economists state that nearly 300 million full-time jobs remain exposed to AI-driven automation 14 .  McKinsey  estimates  demonstrate  how,  by  2030,  up  to  30  per  cent  of current work hours could be automated by generative AI 15  across Europe and the United States. They state that businesses will 'need a major skill upgrade' as the deployment of  AI  would  raise  the  demand  for  social  and  emotional  skills  along  with  a  need  for\n\n9  Cazzaniga, M., Jaumotte, M.

In line with the IMF estimates, insights from Ernst &amp; Young state that while the impact of AI on emerging economies is lower relative to the advanced economies, one can still expect 57 per cent of occupations in emerging countries  to  be  affected  by  higher  Generative  AI  adoption 16 .  Similar  sentiments  are prevalent among surveyed CEOs 17  and other private sector estimates 18 .\n\n13.11    Anxieties about the effects of AI remain high in India as well, considering our country is a services-led economy. Among white-collar workers, an IIM Ahmedabad Survey highlights how 68 per cent of the surveyed employees expect their jobs to be partially  or  fully  automated  by  AI  within  the  next  five  years 19 .  Forty  per  cent  of  the employees believe AI will make their skills  redundant.  Copestake  et  al.  (2023)  also state that firms have substantially increased AI skill demand across regions, industries, firms and occupations 20 . As per their findings, these jobs pay a 13 to 17 per cent salary premium over baseline estimates. India's banking sector is also witnessing adoption among well-capitalised and larger banks, per a recently published RBI study 21 . With trends expected to continue towards even higher AI adoption by the private sector and the market, NASSCOM estimates that the Indian AI market will grow at 25 to 35 per cent CAGR by 2027 22 .\n\n13.12 These estimates are substantial and when viewed through the lens of history, one could argue that concerns, to a degree, are valid. Previous technological revolutions have been painful, and the damage brought on has been long lasting. Andrew Haldane illustrates that in the pursuit of productivity and profits, the substitution of labour for capital  has  resulted  in  widespread  economic  hardship,  damaging  social  cohesion 23 . Each  revolution  displaced  large  segments  of  the  workforce.  Many  struggled  to  find new employment, especially in geographies and occupations where the scale of impact was unanticipated or underestimated. Consequently, income inequality rose, as those who adapted to  new  technological  demands  saw  their  wages  increase,  while  others experienced declining pay and fewer opportunities.

Workers may not immediately benefit from the productivity and profitability gains associated with technological advancements. For instance, during the early stages of the industrial revolution, wages frequently lagged behind increases in productivity. These transitions were also protracted, as it could take decades for displaced workers to find alternative livelihoods. The first Industrial revolution exemplifies this dynamic, with workers who were laid off  facing  sustained  unemployment well into the 19th Century - a period known as 'Engle's pause'. Thus, societies where the balance between capital and labour was not carefully managed by capable institutions were marked by enduring hardships for many who were affected.\n\n13.14 Protracted labour displacement is something that a labour-surplus country like India cannot afford. Our primary challenge is the challenge of numbers. As highlighted in  the  Economic  Survey  2023-24,  India  would  have  to  create  an  average  of  78.5 lakh jobs annually in the non-farm sector by 2030 to cater to the rising workforce. Further, India is a majorly services driven economy, with a significant share of the I.T. workforce employed in low value added services. Such jobs are the most susceptible to automation, as firms in a bid to cut costs may substitute labour for technology. We already see this in case of tech-firms in India 25 and the BPO sector in Philippines 26 . India is also a consumption based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course.\n\n13.15 In such a situation, placing a higher weightage on the possibility of an adverse consequence is required as complacency can amplify any negative effects by creating a long-lasting impact. It is the uncertainty associated with the timeline and magnitude of effects that demands the attention of policymakers. In the words of Alan Greenspan, 'Uncertainty  is  not  the  same  as  risk…Uncertainty  involves  unknown  probabilities and  outcomes  with  tremendous  consequences. 27 '  Any  outcome  with  tremendous\n\n24    Mark, E., Rafaty, R., &amp; Schwarz, M.

Since policymaking is a wicked problem, one would rather overestimate the uncertainties and be overprepared than underestimate the effects and have to manage the fallout.\n\n13.16 Responding  to  these  uncertainties  requires  coordinated  efforts  aimed  at addressing the structural issues that can intensify the impact of AI on India's labour market. It is here, the establishment of new, and upgrading existing Institutions will play  a  pivotal  role.  Social  Infrastructure  will  provide  the  required  foundation  for ensuring that the gains from technology can translate into inclusive growth.\n\n##",
