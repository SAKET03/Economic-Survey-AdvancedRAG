In FY25, capital expenditure gathered momentum post-elections, with a focus on sustainable construction practices and increasing private participation. The government has launched several initiatives, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), and PM-Gati Shakti, to promote infrastructure development. Key sectors such as railways, road transport, civil aviation, ports, and power have shown significant growth, with investments in physical connectivity, digital connectivity, and urban infrastructure. The chapter highlights the need for continued infrastructure investment, sustainable practices, and private participation to achieve India's growth objectives.\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Urban Infrastructure\n\n## URBAN INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n## Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban\n\n6.31 Building on the success of the Open Defecation Free (ODF) nation through the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM-U), SBM-Urban 2.0 was launched in 2021. It envisions\n\ncreating 'garbage-free cities', integrating waste management and sanitation practices aligned with sustainability and circular economy principles. Progress and cumulative achievements under the SBM-U are given below:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6.32  The impact of the SBM-U was well-recognised. As per the 78th round report of NSS 15 ,  97  per cent of households in urban areas report access to toilets. Niti Aayog Sector Report (2021) 16 reported that SBM-U was well aligned with sustainable development goals and national priorities and was effectively implemented. Further, to encourage cities  to  improve  urban  sanitation,  the  government  developed  the  ODF,  ODF+,\n\n15 Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. (2023, March).

The Swachhata App effectively allows citizens to report grievances, directing them to the relevant municipal corporation for resolution. With 2.08 crore users, the app has handled 2.55 crore complaints, resolving 2.39 crore. The Google toilet locator allows users to upload information about community and public toilets in their cities as 'SBM Toilet' on Google Maps and provide feedback. To date, 67,407 toilets across 3,326 cities are mapped on Google Maps, including those in hospitals, malls, bus stands, railway stations, metro stations, markets, and more.\n\n6.34 Urban  housing: The  Pradhan  Mantri  Awas  Yojana  -  Urban  (PMAY-U), launched in 2015, aims to provide permanent housing in urban areas. As of November 25, 2024, a total of 1.18 crore houses have been sanctioned, with 1.14 crore grounded and over 89 lakh completed. PMAY-U 2.0 was launched in September 2024 to assist an additional one crore households. Currently, 29 states and union territories have signed agreements to implement PMAY-U 2.0, with approval having been granted for 6 lakh houses in FY25.\n\n6.35 Urban transport: Metro rail and rapid rail transit systems are operational or under construction in 29 cities across India, with 1010 kilometres currently operational in 23 cities and an additional 980 kilometres underway. As of January 5, 2025, 62.7 kms were operationalised in FY25, and the daily ridership reached 10.2 million. These systems have led to considerable savings in emissions, time, vehicle operating costs, accidents and infrastructure maintenance.\n\n## 6.36 Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT):\n\nAMRUT scheme was launched in 2015 to focus on improving urban water management in 500 cities. As a result, tap water coverage has increased to 70 per cent, and sewerage coverage has risen to 62 per cent. The mission has created or augmented water treatment capacity of 4,649 million litres per day and developed 2,439 parks, adding 5,070 acres of green space. In 2021, AMRUT 2.0 was introduced to expand coverage to all statutory towns and cities, with an allocation of ₹2.77 lakh crore during FY22 to FY26. This phase so far has initiated 8,923 projects worth ₹1.89 lakh crore. AMRUT 2.0 actively involves self-help groups and promotes innovative technologies.\n\n6.37 Smart Cities Mission: Launched in 2015, the mission aims to develop smart cities with essential infrastructure, good quality of life and a sustainable environment.
