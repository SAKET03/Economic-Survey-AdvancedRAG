  "content": "Chapter 9 Summary:\nThe agricultural sector in India has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23. The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, providing a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) to develop and conserve natural resources alongside farming systems. The agricultural sector faces challenges such as climate change, water scarcity, and soil degradation, which require focused and targeted interventions. The sector's growth potential is significant, with opportunities for agro-based entrepreneurship and employment generation. The government has launched several initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). The food processing industry is also a critical sector, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The sector's growth is crucial for ensuring food security and achieving sustainable development goals.\n\nSubchapter 13 Content:\n# Food Management: Enabling Food Security\n\n## FOOD MANAGEMENT: Enabling Food Security\n\n9.53 The basic concept of food security is to ensure that there is access to basic food for their active and healthy lives. It is characterised by the availability, access, utilisation, and stability of food supply. While the government has long tackled household food\n\nsecurity through the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Targeted PDS (TPDS), the National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013 and the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) marked a fundamental shift in the approach to food security. That is transitioning from a welfare-based to a rights-based approach. NFSA act legally entitles up to 75 per cent of the rural population and up to 50 per cent of the urban population to  receive  foodgrain,  free  of  cost,  under  the  Targeted  Public  Distribution  System, which, as per Census 2011, comes to 81.35 crore persons. Therefore, about two-thirds of the population is covered under the Act to receive highly subsidised food grains. In addition, PMGKAY was introduced to alleviate the suffering of the poor and vulnerable caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The allocation of free food grain under PMGKAY is in addition to the regular allocation for around 80 crore beneficiaries. The provision of free food grains under PMGKAY for another five years, with effect from 1st January 2024, reflects the long-term commitment and vision of the Government for addressing National food and nutrition security.\n\n9.54 To enhance the efficiency of the Public Distribution System (PDS), the government is fully committed to achieving 100 per cent e-KYC compliance nationwide. This aligns with  the  One  Nation,  One  Ration  Card  (ONORC)  scheme,  allowing  beneficiaries  to complete electronic know your customer e-KYC anywhere, regardless of their home state. Beneficiaries can authenticate their Aadhaar biometrics at any Fair Price Shop (FPS), making it especially convenient for migrant workers to access their entitlements. To facilitate post-harvest lending for farmers, especially small and marginal farmers, the government has approved the Credit Guarantee Scheme for electronic-negotiable warehouse receipt (e-NWR)-based Pledge Financing (CGS-NPF). Under this scheme, farmers  can  obtain  loans  against  e-NWRs  issued  for  agricultural  and  horticultural commodities stored in accredited warehouses. The scheme covers the loss incurred by the bank due to credit and warehouseman risk. The scheme will help in increasing postharvest lending against e-NWRs and thereby play a role in improving farmers' income.\n\n## BOX IX.8 : Measures to support foodgrain storage infrastructure in the country\n\n-     To  support and upgrade the storage infrastructure for foodgrains and to ramp up the storage capacity in India, steel silos are being created in PPP.\n-     The government is creating capacity under Hub and Spoke Model Silos, where 'Hub' silos have a dedicated railway siding and container depot facility. While the transportation from 'Spoke' Silos to 'Hub' Silos is undertaken by road, transportation from Hub to Hub is via rail.\n-     To  improve  food  grain  storage,  especially  in  hilly  and  remote  areas,  the  government is exploring the use of Flospan, a type of Mobile Storage Unit (MSU), in collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP). These units can be quickly erected and have a storage capacity of 400 metric tonnes. As a pilot project, WFP has installed Flospan in six states: Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Mizoram, Uttarakhand, and Chhattisgarh.\n-     To modernise government grain warehouses, the government partnered with WFP and IGMRI to pilot a 'Smart Warehouse'. This warehouse uses sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, airflow, and rodent activity, providing real-time data to improve storage and reduce losses.",
