  "content": "Chapter 1 Summary:\nThe global economy exhibited steady yet uneven growth across regions in 2024. The slowdown in global manufacturing, especially in Europe and parts of Asia, was due to supply chain disruptions and weak external demand. In contrast, the services sector performed better, supporting growth in many economies. Inflationary pressures eased in most economies, but services inflation remained persistent. Commodity prices stabilized, but the risk of synchronised price increases persists. Central banks may chart varying paths of monetary easing, leading to uncertainty over future policy rates and inflation trajectories. Geopolitical tensions, ongoing conflicts, and trade policy risks continue to pose significant challenges to global economic stability. India's economy displayed steady growth, with real GDP estimated to grow by 6.4 per cent in FY25. Growth in the first half of FY25 was supported by agriculture and services, with rural demand improving due to record Kharif production and favourable agricultural conditions. The manufacturing sector faced pressures due to weak global demand and domestic seasonal conditions. Private consumption remained stable, reflecting steady domestic demand. Fiscal discipline and strong external balance supported by a services trade surplus and healthy remittance growth contributed to macroeconomic stability. India's economic prospects for FY26 are balanced, with headwinds including elevated geopolitical and trade uncertainties and possible commodity price shocks. Domestically, the translation of order books of the private capital goods sector into sustained investment pick-up, improvements in consumer confidence, and corporate wage pick-up will be key to promoting growth. Rural demand backed by a rebound in agricultural production, anticipated easing of food inflation, and a stable macro-economic environment provide an upside to near-term growth. India will need to improve its global competitiveness through grassroots-level structural reforms and deregulation to reinforce its medium-term growth potential. The global economy grew by 3.3 per cent in 2023, with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) projecting growth of 3.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Global growth is expected to average around 3.2 per cent over the next five years. Advanced economies witnessed stable growth in the first half of 2024, but growth varies across regions. The US is expected to grow at 2.8 per cent in 2024, while the Euro Area is expected to grow at 0.8 per cent in 2024 and 1.0 per cent in 2025. The global composite Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has stayed in the expansion zone for the fourteenth month in a row. The services sector continues to show strength, while manufacturing PMI indicated contraction. Inflation rates across economies have trended downward steadily, approaching central bank target levels. However, disinflation seems to have slowed due to the persistence of services inflation. The risk to inflation from increases in commodity prices seems limited in 2025-2026. Major central banks have implemented a policy pivot to lower policy rates. There is uncertainty regarding the levels of the year-ahead and terminal policy rates across economies. Geopolitical risks remain elevated due to ongoing conflicts, which pose significant risks to the global economic outlook. India's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for FY25 is estimated to be 6.4 per cent. Private final consumption expenditure at constant prices is estimated to grow by 7.3 per cent. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) at constant prices is estimated to grow by 6.4 per cent. The agriculture sector is expected to rebound to a growth of 3.8 per cent in FY25. The industrial sector is estimated to grow by 6.2 per cent in FY25. Growth in the services sector is expected to remain robust at 7.2 per cent. The overall growth was tempered by moderation in industrial growth, particularly in manufacturing, which faced challenges from slowing global demand and supply chain disruptions. Agriculture growth remained steady in H1 FY25, with Q2 recording a growth rate of 3.5 per cent. Healthy Kharif production, above-normal monsoons, and an adequate reservoir level supported agricultural growth. The industrial sector grew by 6 per cent in H1 FY25. The services sector continues to perform well in FY25, with a notable growth in Q1 and Q2 resulting in 7.1 per cent growth in H1 FY25. India's GDP at constant prices grew by 6.7 per cent and 5.4 per cent in Q1 and Q2 FY25, respectively. From a demand perspective, Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) firmed up in H1 FY25, growing by 6.7 per cent YoY. The moderation in real GDP growth can be traced to a softening of growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) from 10.1 per cent in H1 FY24 to 6.4 per cent in H1 FY25. The slowdown in investment activity is likely temporary. Green shoots in capital formation are visible. The Union government's indicators of fiscal discipline have improved progressively. The quality of expenditure approximated by capital expenditure as a per cent of total expenditure of the union has continuously improved since FY21. The revenue expenditure of the states grew at 12 per cent (YoY) during April to November 2024. Retail headline inflation has softened from 5.4 per cent in FY24 to 4.9 per cent in April - December 2024. The decline is attributed to a 0.9 percentage point reduction in core inflation between FY24 and April - December 2024. India's external sector displayed mixed trends. Merchandise exports grew by 1.6 per cent YoY in April - December 2024. Non-petroleum exports were up by 7.1 per cent. Services trade surplus has lent balance to the overall trade deficit. India's robust services exports have propelled the country to secure the seventh-largest share in global services exports. Remittances from abroad led to a healthy net inflow of private transfers. India's current account deficit (CAD) remains relatively contained at 1.2 per cent of GDP in Q2 FY25. Comfortable financing of the CAD by the capital account has ensured external sector stability. Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows increased 17.9 per cent YoY in April - November 2024. The banking and financial sector remains stable and well-capitalised. Credit disbursal by scheduled commercial banks is growing in double-digits. Stability in the banking sector is underscored by declining asset impairments, robust capital buffers, and strong operational performance. India's labour market growth in recent years has been supported by post-pandemic recovery and increased formalisation. The unemployment rate for individuals aged 15 years and above has steadily declined from 6 per cent in 2017-18 to 3.2 per cent in 2023-24. The labour force participation rate (LFPR) and the worker-to-population ratio (WPR) have also increased. India's growth in FY26 would be between 6.3 and 6.8 per cent.\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Outlook and Way Forward\n\n## OUTLOOK AND WAY FORWARD\n\n1.68 A steady growth trajectory shapes the global economic outlook for 2024, though regional patterns vary. The near-term global growth is expected to be a shade lower than  the  trend  level.  The  services  sector  continues  to  drive  global  expansion,  with notable resilience in India. Meanwhile, manufacturing is struggling in Europe, where structural weaknesses persist. Trade outlook also remains clouded in the next year.\n\n1.69 Inflationary  pressures  have  been  easing  globally,  though  risks  of  synchronised price pressures linger due to potential geopolitical disruptions, such as tensions in the Middle East and the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. Central banks have adopted more accommodative monetary policies. However, the pace of rate cuts varies across regions depending on the growth imperatives and the pace of disinflation, creating potential divergences in economic recovery.\n\n1.70 On the domestic front, rebounding rural demand augurs well for consumption. Investment  activity  is  expected  to  pick  up,  supported  by  higher  public  capex  and improving business expectations. Capacity utilisation in manufacturing remains above the  long-term  average,  and  private  sector  order  books  have  shown  steady  growth, alongside a rise in investment intentions. However, these gains could be tempered by the global excess capacities in sectors such as steel, leading to aggressive trade policies in search of demand.\n\n1.71  Going forward, food inflation is likely to soften in Q4 FY25 with the seasonal easing of vegetable prices and Kharif harvest arrivals. Good Rabi production is likely to contain food prices in the first half of FY26. Adverse weather events and rise in international agricultural commodity prices, however, pose risks to food inflation. Global energy and commodity prices have softened in the recent past, making the core inflation outlook benign. However, risks remain on account of significant global political and economic uncertainties.\n\n1.72  In  brief,  there  are  many  upsides  to  domestic  investment,  output  growth  and disinflation in FY26. There are equally strong, prominently extraneous, downsides too.\n\nNonetheless, the fundamentals of the domestic economy remain robust, with a strong external account, calibrated fiscal consolidation and stable private consumption. On balance of these considerations, we expect that the growth in FY26 would be between 6.3 and 6.8 per cent.\n\n1.73  Navigating global headwinds will require strategic and prudent policy management and  reinforcing  the  domestic  fundamentals.  The  Budget  2024-25  laid  out  a  multisectoral policy agenda for sustained growth push. In this context, Chapter 5 elaborates on the need for deregulation and reforms at the grassroots level to improve the overall competitiveness of the economy and to lift trend growth rates, supporting higher levels of economic activity.",
