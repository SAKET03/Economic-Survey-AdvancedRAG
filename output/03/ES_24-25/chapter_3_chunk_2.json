Total exports, including merchandise and services, reached USD602.6 billion, growing 6% in the first nine months. Services and goods exports, excluding petroleum and gems and jewelry, grew 10.4%. Total imports were USD682.2 billion, growing 6.9%, driven by steady domestic demand.\\n\\nThe global trade dynamics are shifting towards greater protectionism, requiring India to assess the situation and develop a forward-looking strategic trade roadmap. India can accelerate growth and enhance its presence in global trade by adapting to these trends and leveraging its strengths. To strengthen competitiveness, India should focus on reducing trade-related costs and enhancing export facilitation.\\n\\nForeign portfolio investments (FPIs) showed a mixed trend in FY25, with uncertainty in global markets and profit-taking by foreign portfolio investors leading to capital outflows. However, strong macroeconomic fundamentals, a favorable business environment, and high economic growth kept FPI flows positive overall. Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows showed signs of revival, growing 17.9% to USD55.6 billion in the first eight months of FY25.\\n\\nIndia's foreign exchange reserves stood at USD640.3 billion as of December 2024, sufficient to cover approximately 90% of the country's external debt of USD711.8 billion. The reserves reflect a strong buffer against external vulnerabilities.\\n\\nThe chapter also discusses the impact of global trade dynamics, tariffs, and non-tariff measures on India's trade performance. The Global Trade Alert database reported over 26,000 new restrictions related to trade and investments globally between 2020 and 2024. Technical barriers to trade (TBT) affect 31.6% of product lines, covering 67.1% of global trade.\\n\\nThe European Union's (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) are expected to impact India's exports. The CBAM aims to align the cost of carbon emissions for imported goods with that of domestically produced products, and the EUDR regulates the consumption of products derived from deforested land.\\n\\nIndia's trade performance was robust in FY25, with total exports growing 6% to USD602.6 billion. Merchandise exports registered modest growth of 1.6%, while services exports grew 11.6%. Textile exports increased 7.6%, driven by a 9.1% growth in non-petroleum and non-gems and jewelry exports.\\n\\nThe government's initiatives, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM), and Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM-MITRA) parks, aim to promote the textile sector. India is also actively negotiating trade deals with top importers, such as the EU and the UK.\\n\\nIndia's e-commerce exports are expected to grow significantly, driven by expanding data connectivity, increased penetration of smartphones, and a rise in digital wallets and safer online payments. The government has introduced initiatives to foster cross-border digital trade and promote e-commerce, including the Niryat Bandhu scheme and financial assistance to e-commerce exporters.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy uncertainty index for India captures policy uncertainty from domestic and international events. The index uses internet search data from Google Trends to assess policy uncertainty.\\n\\nIndia's Balance of Payments (BoP) position remained stable, led by resilient services exports, benign crude oil prices, renewed foreign portfolio inflows, and a revival in FDI flows. The current account deficit (CAD) moderated to 1.2% of GDP in Q2 of FY25.\\n\\nPrivate transfers, mainly driven by remittances, grew steadily to USD31.9 billion in Q2 of FY25. The capital and financial account surplus was USD30.5 billion in Q2 of FY25, driven by robust inflows from FDI, FPI, and external loans.\\n\\nFDI inflows into India have surpassed the USD1 trillion mark from April 2000 to September 2024. The services sector remains the largest recipient of FDI, accounting for 19.1% of total equity inflows in H1 of FY25.\\n\\nThe growth trajectory of capital inflows has shown signs of revival in recent quarters. Net capital inflows stood at USD30.5 billion in Q2 of FY25, a significant increase from the USD12.8 billion recorded during the same period in the previous year.\\n\\nForeign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) became net buyers in the Indian equity market in June 2024, injecting substantial capital into the market. However, this trend reversed in October and November 2024, resulting in a net outflow.\\n\\nThe inclusion of Indian Government Bonds (IGB) in global bond indices has significantly supported debt inflows. India's foreign exchange reserves moderated to USD640.3 billion as of December 2024, sufficient to cover approximately 90% of India's external debt.\\n\\nThe import cover stood at 10.9 months as of December 2024, enhancing India's ability to weather external shocks. The BoP surplus and valuation gain drove the improvement in forex reserves.\\n\\nThe value of the Indian Rupee (INR) is market-determined, with no target or specific level or band. The INR depreciated modestly by 2.9% in the first nine months of FY25.\\n\\nIndia's external debt has remained stable, with an external debt to GDP ratio of 19.4% at the end of September 2024. The share of short-term debt in total external debt decreased to 18.8% at the end of September 2024.\\n\\nIndia's external sector is expected to perform well amidst unfavorable geopolitical conditions. The industry must continue to invest in quality, and both the state and private sector must focus on quality and efficiency to increase India's share in overseas markets and generate resources to sustain a higher level of capital formation.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n3.1 The world is experiencing increasing political and economic uncertainty in the wake of geopolitical  conflicts,  increasing  trends  of  geoeconomic  fragmentation,  and recurrent climate events. The Great Election year of 2024, during which more than half of the world's population was exercising their franchise to elect their new governments, meant further declining policy predictability. Such political and economic uncertainty can be detrimental to growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that a one standard deviation increase in uncertainty correlates with a 0.4 to 1.3 percentage point  decrease  in  output  growth. 1 Economists  like  Keynes  and  Tobin  have  pointed out that higher uncertainty requires investors to seek more significant compensation for  risks,  thereby  raising  risk  premia  and  the  overall  cost  of  finance.  Additionally, uncertainty  increases  the  likelihood  of  borrower  defaults,  leading  to  higher  capital costs. Moreover, uncertainty shocks in advanced economies like the US have often led to lower output and reduced prices. 2\n\n3.2 Various indicators are used to monitor global risks and uncertainties and measure policy-related  uncertainty's  impact  on  global  economic  activity.  These  include  the Geopolitical  Risk  (GPR)  index 3 ,  which  tracks  adverse  geopolitical  events  through newspaper  articles;  the  Trade  Policy  Uncertainty  (TPU)  index 4 ,  which  covers  the frequency of articles mentioning trade policy uncertainty and heightened trade tensions, and the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty (GEPU) index 5 , which is a GDP-weighted average of national Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) indices for 21 countries. These indices capture changes occurring in economies constituting about 71 per cent of global output. 6\n\n3.3 These indices provide valuable insights into how uncertainty from trade issues, geopolitical  events,  and  economic  policy  measures  can  impact  global  economic conditions. As of November 2024, the GEPU index remains high, reflecting ongoing global economic policy concerns. Similarly, the TPU index has risen since December 2023, primarily driven by trade tensions and policy changes among major economies.\n\n1   DÃ¶ttling,  R.,  Malaika,  M.,  &amp;  Terrones,  M.

If the economies are accounted at market exchange rates the economies constitute roughly 80 per cent of the global economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n3.4 The  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  has  developed  a  policy  uncertainty  index specifically  for  India,  utilising  various  global  indices.  This  index  leverages  internet search  data  from  Google  Trends  to  assess  policy  uncertainty  from  domestic  and international events. Furthermore, the index is updated in real-time. 7,8\n\n3.5 With  this  backdrop,  the  chapter  presents  the  performance  of  India's  external sector  amidst  the  prevailing  global  environment.  Section  I  provides  an  overview  of the global trade dynamics, emphasising tariffs and non-tariff measures (NTMs) and the performance of the global external sector amidst challenges. Section II delves into India's trade performance, highlighting the trends across both the merchandise and services sectors. It examines the performance of India's textile exports and the factors restricting its global expansion. Further, a detailed analysis of India's diversification in exports to new markets has been presented. The key drivers and challenges affecting India's e-commerce export growth are also discussed in depth. Section III discusses the factors restricting export growth and outlines the government initiatives to simplify export procedures to enhance trade performance. Section IV presents India's Balance of Payments (BoP) situation, highlighting current and capital account trends, foreign exchange reserves, exchange rate movements, and India's external debt position. The last section concludes the chapter with an outlook for India's external sector, considering the evolving global and domestic economic landscape.\n\n7   When faced with heightened uncertainty, it is typical of economic agents to 'search' for more information. The Google Trends-based uncertainty index (India-GUI) leverages this behaviour to measure overall uncertainty by using internet search volumes for a list of keywords about fiscal, monetary and trade policy in India. The policyrelated keywords are curated, based on mentions in central bank policy statements as well as coverage in the financial press.\n\nPratap, B., and Priyaranjan, N. (2023).
