  "content": "Chapter 9 Summary:\nThe agricultural sector in India has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23. The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, reassuring them of a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the use of drones and fertigation techniques to optimize fertilizer applications. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has been introduced to enable farmers to meet their short-term working capital requirements promptly and hassle-free. The government has also launched the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) to provide insurance for farmers against crop losses due to natural calamities, pests, and diseases. The agricultural extension services have been strengthened to disseminate knowledge, enhance productivity, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. The government has also promoted private investment in agricultural marketing infrastructure through initiatives such as the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme. The food processing industry in India is one of the largest employers within organized manufacturing, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated several key programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The government has also implemented various initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). India's agricultural sector remains a crucial pillar for economic growth and ensuring food security for the nation, with significant potential for growth and development.\n\nSubchapter 3 Content:\n# Crop Production: Incentivising Productivity Increase, Crop Diversification and Efficiency in the Use of Inputs\n\nCROP PRODUCTION: Incentivising productivity increase, crop diversification and efficiency in the use of inputs\n\n9.10 Despite the increase in crop production, further enhancements in productivity across  various  crops  and  regions  are  vital  for  boosting  performance  and  positively influencing farmers' incomes. Productivity is closely linked to on-farm and post-harvest inputs such as improved access to quality seeds, better irrigation facilities, efficient water management practices, effective extension services, soil health improvements, modern post-harvest infrastructure, and accessible markets. Additionally, agricultural price policies play a crucial role in facilitating informed decision-making by protecting farmers from market price volatility and encouraging them to diversify their crops, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.11    The  Minimum  Support  Price  (MSP)  for  essential  crops  such  as  wheat,  rice, pulses, oilseeds, and nutri-cereals acts as a safety net for farmers, reassuring them of a guaranteed minimum price for their crops from the government. This mechanism also serves as a guiding signal for farmers in planning their future crop compositions. In the Union Budget of 2018-19, the government decided the principle of fixing MSP at a level of at least 1.5 times the weighted average cost of production for these crops. The support provides the necessary returns to promote sustainable farming practices and encourage farmers to focus on cultivating key crops. The government has raised the MSP for nutri cereals (Shree Anna), pulses, and oilseeds as part of these initiatives. For the fiscal year FY25, the MSP for arhar and bajra has been increased by 59 per cent and 77 per cent over the weighted average cost of production, respectively. Moreover, the MSP for Masur has risen by 89 per cent, while rapeseed has seen an impressive increase of 98 per cent.\n\n##",
