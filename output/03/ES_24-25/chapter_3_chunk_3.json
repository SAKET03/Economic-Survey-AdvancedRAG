Total exports, including merchandise and services, reached USD602.6 billion, growing 6% in the first nine months. Services and goods exports, excluding petroleum and gems and jewelry, grew 10.4%. Total imports were USD682.2 billion, growing 6.9%, driven by steady domestic demand.\\n\\nThe global trade dynamics are shifting towards greater protectionism, requiring India to assess the situation and develop a forward-looking strategic trade roadmap. India can accelerate growth and enhance its presence in global trade by adapting to these trends and leveraging its strengths. To strengthen competitiveness, India should focus on reducing trade-related costs and enhancing export facilitation.\\n\\nForeign portfolio investments (FPIs) showed a mixed trend in FY25, with uncertainty in global markets and profit-taking by foreign portfolio investors leading to capital outflows. However, strong macroeconomic fundamentals, a favorable business environment, and high economic growth kept FPI flows positive overall. Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows showed signs of revival, growing 17.9% to USD55.6 billion in the first eight months of FY25.\\n\\nIndia's foreign exchange reserves stood at USD640.3 billion as of December 2024, sufficient to cover approximately 90% of the country's external debt of USD711.8 billion. The reserves reflect a strong buffer against external vulnerabilities.\\n\\nThe chapter also discusses the impact of global trade dynamics, tariffs, and non-tariff measures on India's trade performance. The Global Trade Alert database reported over 26,000 new restrictions related to trade and investments globally between 2020 and 2024. Technical barriers to trade (TBT) affect 31.6% of product lines, covering 67.1% of global trade.\\n\\nThe European Union's (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) are expected to impact India's exports. The CBAM aims to align the cost of carbon emissions for imported goods with that of domestically produced products, and the EUDR regulates the consumption of products derived from deforested land.\\n\\nIndia's trade performance was robust in FY25, with total exports growing 6% to USD602.6 billion. Merchandise exports registered modest growth of 1.6%, while services exports grew 11.6%. Textile exports increased 7.6%, driven by a 9.1% growth in non-petroleum and non-gems and jewelry exports.\\n\\nThe government's initiatives, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM), and Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM-MITRA) parks, aim to promote the textile sector. India is also actively negotiating trade deals with top importers, such as the EU and the UK.\\n\\nIndia's e-commerce exports are expected to grow significantly, driven by expanding data connectivity, increased penetration of smartphones, and a rise in digital wallets and safer online payments. The government has introduced initiatives to foster cross-border digital trade and promote e-commerce, including the Niryat Bandhu scheme and financial assistance to e-commerce exporters.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy uncertainty index for India captures policy uncertainty from domestic and international events. The index uses internet search data from Google Trends to assess policy uncertainty.\\n\\nIndia's Balance of Payments (BoP) position remained stable, led by resilient services exports, benign crude oil prices, renewed foreign portfolio inflows, and a revival in FDI flows. The current account deficit (CAD) moderated to 1.2% of GDP in Q2 of FY25.\\n\\nPrivate transfers, mainly driven by remittances, grew steadily to USD31.9 billion in Q2 of FY25. The capital and financial account surplus was USD30.5 billion in Q2 of FY25, driven by robust inflows from FDI, FPI, and external loans.\\n\\nFDI inflows into India have surpassed the USD1 trillion mark from April 2000 to September 2024. The services sector remains the largest recipient of FDI, accounting for 19.1% of total equity inflows in H1 of FY25.\\n\\nThe growth trajectory of capital inflows has shown signs of revival in recent quarters. Net capital inflows stood at USD30.5 billion in Q2 of FY25, a significant increase from the USD12.8 billion recorded during the same period in the previous year.\\n\\nForeign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) became net buyers in the Indian equity market in June 2024, injecting substantial capital into the market. However, this trend reversed in October and November 2024, resulting in a net outflow.\\n\\nThe inclusion of Indian Government Bonds (IGB) in global bond indices has significantly supported debt inflows. India's foreign exchange reserves moderated to USD640.3 billion as of December 2024, sufficient to cover approximately 90% of India's external debt.\\n\\nThe import cover stood at 10.9 months as of December 2024, enhancing India's ability to weather external shocks. The BoP surplus and valuation gain drove the improvement in forex reserves.\\n\\nThe value of the Indian Rupee (INR) is market-determined, with no target or specific level or band. The INR depreciated modestly by 2.9% in the first nine months of FY25.\\n\\nIndia's external debt has remained stable, with an external debt to GDP ratio of 19.4% at the end of September 2024. The share of short-term debt in total external debt decreased to 18.8% at the end of September 2024.\\n\\nIndia's external sector is expected to perform well amidst unfavorable geopolitical conditions. The industry must continue to invest in quality, and both the state and private sector must focus on quality and efficiency to increase India's share in overseas markets and generate resources to sustain a higher level of capital formation.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 3 Content:\n# Global Trade Dynamics\n\n## GLOBAL TRADE DYNAMICS\n\n3.6 Disruptions in the Red Sea that began in November 2023 have forced changes in trade routes, causing higher shipping costs and longer delivery times. 9 This is particularly true for trade between Asia and Europe, as 40 per cent of this trade passes through the Red Sea region. 10  Similar conflicts in the Hormuz Strait, which channels 21 per cent of global petroleum liquid consumption, have disrupted energy trade and increased prices. Additionally, climate change is enhancing the uncertainties. 11  For instance, the recent drought in the Panama Canal jeopardised international trade, affecting approximately 5 per cent of global maritime trade volumes that transit through it. These conditions are creating uncertainty, leading to a slowdown in international trade, 12  reshaping the contours of trade in terms of a rise in protectionist trade policies and shifting global supply chains.\n\n- 3.7 As evident from Chart III.2, there has been a noticeable rise in the political proximity of trade since late 2022. This indicates a preference for bilateral trade between countries with similar geopolitical stances, i.e., friend-shoring 13 and nearshoring. 14  Concurrently, there has been an increasing concentration of global trade 15  to favour significant trade relationships. For instance, Russia and China's trade dependence on the EU and the US's dependence on China has declined in recent years. In contrast, the dependence of Russia and Vietnam on China has increased. 16,17\n- 3.8 Government interventions, including NTMs, reinforce the change in bilateral trade patterns due to geopolitical considerations. The rise in NTMs, which began after the COVID-19 pandemic, was further fuelled by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. A report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 18 indicates that technical NTMs impact over 30 per cent of products and nearly 70 per cent of global trade. This is discussed further in paras 3.15 to 3.20 of this chapter.\n\n9  UNCTAD rapid assessment, 'Impact to Global Trade of disruption of shipping routes in the Red Sea, Black Sea and Panama Canal', https://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/osginf2024d2\\_en.pdf.\n\n10 Bonnell and McHugh, 2024, https://tinyurl.com/5n7wy8xj.\n\n11  U.S. Energy Information Administration, https://www.eia.gov/.\n\n12    IMF  Working Paper dated 9 July 2024, 'The Heterogenous Effects of Uncertainty on Trade', https://tinyurl. com/2xywd48v.\n\n13    Friend shoring is calculated as trade-weighted political proximity as measured by the United Nations voting patterns.\n\n- 14  Nearshoring is calculated as the reverse of the trade-weighted average distance in km.\n\n15  Trade concentration is calculated based on the Herfindahl concentration index.\n\n16  UNCTAD estimates based on national statistics (https://unctad.org/statistics) The dependence of an economy on another is calculated as the ratio of their bilateral trade over the total trade of the dependent economy.

The World Trade Organisation (WTO) database shows a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 3.5 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, in global merchandise export and import indices in Q3 of 2024 (seasonally adjusted, 2005 Q1=100). Further, the global services exports and imports grew by 7.9 per cent and 6.7 per cent (YoY) during the same period.\n\n3.10 Over the last four quarters, trade growth in developing countries generally exceeded that  of  developed  nations.  However,  this  trend  reversed  in  Q3  of  2024,  with  positive developments in developed economies driving trade growth. In contrast, trade growth in East Asia stalled, and several major Asian developing economies experienced negative growth.\n\n3.11  According  to  the  UNCTAD  nowcast 20 ,  the  positive  momentum  in  global  trade witnessed in the first three quarters of 2024 is expected to continue into Q4. As a result, global trade is set to exceed its 2022 record, reaching nearly USD 33 trillion in 2024. This record high is likely to be driven by a 7 per cent increase in services trade (YoY), while goods trade is projected to grow by about 2 per cent in 2024 but remain below its 2022 peak. Overall, global trade is expected to expand by about USD 1 trillion (or 3.3 per cent) in 2024, with goods and services contributing approximately USD 500 billion each.\n\n19    UNCTAD Global Trade Update December 2024, https://tinyurl.com/5n8fr7a3\n\n20  Ibid note 19.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Tariff policies\n\n3.12 To promote free trade, encourage investment, and lower trading costs, countries worldwide have established various trade agreements. The number of regional trade agreements (RTAs) in effect has grown substantially, increasing from 22 in 1990 to 369 as of August 2024. 21  Increased emphasis on free trade and enhanced collaboration in international trade policies under the WTO has reduced border tariffs among nations. For instance, between 2000 and 2024, the average tariff rates on dutiable items in India  decreased  from  48.9  per  cent  to  17.3  per  cent,  while  in  China,  they  fell  from 16.4 per cent to 8.3 per cent. 22   Commodity-wise, between 2012 and 2022, the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) and preferential tariffs declined in agriculture, manufacturing, and natural resources. Globally, the simple average MFN and preferential tariffs for agriculture dropped by approximately 3 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, between 2012 and 2022. The simple average preferential tariffs decreased by about 1 per cent in the manufacturing sector.\n\n3.13 At a broader level, India's import tariff policy has evolved over time, balancing domestic policy goals with the need to integrate into the global economy. Tariffs vary by sector, with considerations like protecting sensitive sectors from foreign competition and permitting access to important raw materials and intermediate goods. India has ensured that tariff policies comply with WTO rules and regulations. Over time, several efforts have been made to rationalise tariffs further and address the inverted duty structures.\n\n3.14 Tariffs  are  often  perceived  to  have  an  impact  on  competitiveness.  However,  if used in a calibrated way, tariffs can aid the goals of industrial policy and help in the development of desirable sectors in the economy (Box III.1).\n\n21  WTO data on regional Trade Agreements, https://tinyurl.com/59e3yw6b.\n\n22  Based on the data available on the WTO Integrated Database, https://tao.wto.org/.\n\n## Box III.1: Tariffs and successful industrial policy design\n\nIndustrial policy refers to measures that target the transformation of an industry in pursuit of a public goal. Tariffs are a standard tool of industrial policy and are often seen as a way to support fledgling industries before they gain traction. However, using tariffs requires a calibrated approach which balances the sector's needs with the costs imposed on the rest of the economy. Tariffs can also be viewed as a lever within a system of tools that can further the goals of industrialisation.\n\nThe use of tariffs in industrial policy can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution. Tariffs were commonly used in Western Europe and North America to catch up with the British industrial revolution. As Matthew C. Klein and Michael Pettis note in their book 'Trade wars are class wars',\n\n'Freidrich List, who moved from Germany to America in 1825, wrote that a country such as Germany, which was less developed but 'possesses the mental and material means' to become wealthy, should instead avoid free trade and 'strengthen her own individual powers.' … The United States levied tariffs on manufactured goods of about 45 per cent from 1870 through 1913…American manufacturers were protected from foreigners but competed within the large-and expanding-domestic market.'\n\nThis accords with the observations made by Professor Robert C. Allen on the development history  of  Europe  and  North  America 23 .  According  to  him,  North  America  and  Western Continental  Europe  caught  up  with  the  British  industrial  revolution  by  adopting  the following:\n\n-     Internal free market (elimination of internal tariffs)-national single market\n-   Stable domestic banking system\n-   High external tariff\n-   Universal Education\n-   Infrastructure.\n\nThey did not catch up with Britain practising free trade and open capital markets.\n\nGlobally,  modern-day  industrial  policies  use  a  mix  of  policies,  including  tariff-based protection and other levers such as credit grants and export-related subsidies. 24  Illustrative of this fact, tariffs accounted for just 1.3 per cent of all industrial policy interventions between 2010 and 2022. 25\n\nLessons in successful industrial policy design can be gleaned from the support the Korean government extended to its heavy chemicals industry in the Seventies. Korean industrial policy in the heavy chemicals sector led to significant gains in output, labour productivity and long-term comparative advantage of the industry's exports. Tools such as tariff-based protection and quantitative restrictions were used for a limited period, after which protection\n\n23  2013 Gideon Rosenbluth Memorial Lecture delivered by Dr Robert Allen, Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, https://tinyurl.com/7cv2hzu6.\n\n24    Juhász, R., Lane, N., &amp; Rodrik, D. (2023). The new economics of industrial policy. Annual Review of Economics, 16, (https://tinyurl.com/3m5f2t2u).\n\n25  Ibid note 24.\n\ntapered in the 1980s. 26  Importantly, in Korea, tariffs were only one element of a composite industrial policy which sought to protect domestic industry and, at the same time, demanded a reciprocal performance obligation on the part of the industry receiving protection.\n\nThe  recipe  for  a  successful  industrial  policy  lies  in  the  simultaneous  use  of  carrots  and sticks, with the sticks often being longer than the carrots. Taking a comprehensive look at the industrial policies of Northeast Asia, Joe Studwell wrote in 'How Asia Works' that the region succeeded with its industrial policy because it punished non-performers more than it rewarded performers. As Studwell notes, the emphasis on infant industry protection in Northeast Asian economies went hand in hand with external benchmarking through export performance. There were special privileges for local businesses, but there was accountability for  export  performance.  That  is  how  scale,  productivity,  efficiency  and  rapid  economic growth were achieved. Studwell repeatedly notes that Korean industrial policy punished its non-performers more than helped performers.\n\nTo summarise, the growth experiences of the industrialised West and the miracle growth economies of the East suggest that tariffs were indeed a prominent tool used to further industrialisation. However, tariffs were used in a calibrated way, and a whole-of-government approach  was  adopted  in  crafting  tariff  policies.  Finally,  industrial  policy  goals  were achieved not by protection alone but by policies which ensured that the protected industries performed in response to the protection afforded.\n\n## Non-tariff measures\n\n3.15   The decline in tariffs globally, as discussed above, has been accompanied by an increase in the implementation of NTMs 27  across countries. The Global Trade Alert database 28   shows that between 2020 and 2024, over 26,000 new restrictions related to  trade  and  investments  have  been  globally  imposed.  This  is  further  elucidated  in Chapter 5. The Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) affect 31.6 per cent of the product lines, covering 67.1 per cent of the global trade (as of December 2024). This is followed by export-related measures, affecting 19.3 per cent of the product lines and covering 31.2 per cent of the global trade. Sectors most affected by NTMs include agriculture, manufacturing, and natural resources. 29\n\n26    Lane,  N  (2022).  'Manufacturing  revolutions:  industrial  policy  and  industrialization  in  South  Korea',  CSAE Working Paper Series, (https://tinyurl.com/ye2ahh7k).\n\n27    UNCTAD  defines  NTMs  as  policy  measures  that  are  not  ordinary  customs  tariffs  but  can  still  significantly impact  international  trade  in  goods.  These  measures  can  affect  either  the  quantities  traded,  prices,  or  both (Classification  of  NTMs  |  UNCTAD).  NTMs  are  classified  into  import-related  and  export-related  categories based on the above classification. Import-related NTMs are further classified as 'technical' or 'non-technical.' Technical measures comprise sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), technical barriers to trade (TBT), and pre-shipment inspections. Non-technical measures encompass traditional trade policies like quotas, subsidies,\n\nand trade remedies, including those addressing unfair trade practices. In 2006, the UNCTAD established the Group of Eminent Persons on Non-tariff Barriers (NTBs) and the MultiAgency Support Team (MAST) comprising eight international organisations such as the IMF, OECD, UNIDO), UNCTAD, the World Bank and WTO etc. Over the years, MAST has created a coding system as a foundation for  collecting  and  tallying  NTMs.  The  objective  of  the  International  Classification  of  NTMs  (refer:  UNCTAD report on International Classification of Non-Tariff Measures, https://tinyurl.com/mr3mp5uk) was to provide\n\ninformation and clarification on new and existing measures and to improve their comparability across countries.\n\n28  Global Trade Alert database, https://www.globaltradealert.org/global\\_dynamics.\n\n29    Based on UNCTAD Trade Analysis and Information System (TRAINS) Database, https://trainsonline.unctad.org.\n\n## Chart III.4: Classification of NTMs based on coverage and frequency\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: UNCTAD TRAINS Database\n\nNote: Other includes 'Pre-shipment inspection and other formalities, contingent trade protective measures, non-automatic import licensing,  quotas,  prohibitions,  quantity-control  measures  and  other  restrictions  not including sanitary and phytosanitary measures or measures relating to technical barriers to trade, measures affecting competition, trade-related investment measures, distribution restrictions, restrictions on post-sales services, subsidies and other forms of supports, government procurement restrictions, intellectual property and rules of origin. The frequency index is defined as the percentage of HS 6-digit lines covered. The coverage ratio is defined as the percentage of trade that is subject to NTMs\n\n3.16   Globally,  NTMs,  such  as  subsidies  and  export-related  measures,  have  risen  in aid of nations' industrial policy goals. 30   Unlike broad-based tariffs, NTMs tend to be granular in their approach. 31 They are often less visible, making them harder to assess. 32\n\n3.17    A  report  by  UNCTAD and the UNESCAP 33  shows evidence of increased use of NTMs by countries  to  adapt  and  mitigate  climate  change.  According  to  the  report, although climate change-related NTMs account for only 2.6 per cent of total measures, they  are  concentrated  in  some  of  the  largest  and  most  CO2-intensive  trade  sectors, such as the automotive industry, electricity and heat generation, transformation, and storage. As a result, 26.4 per cent of global trade, valued at USD 6.5 trillion, is covered by climate-change-related NTMs. TBT comprise over 61 per cent of all identified climate change-related NTMs, followed by export-related and price-control measures (as of December 2024). In the future, the imposition of climate-change-related NTMs by the EU in the form of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) 34  and European\n\n30    Juhász R, Lane N, Oehlsen E, Pérez VC. 2023.

As countries/groups  like  the  EU  phase  out  the  free  allowances  they  offer  their  industries under the Emissions Trading System (ETS), they are ushering in CBAM to prevent their consumption from shifting to countries with relatively softer environmental regulations. Under the mechanism, importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price paid by the domestic producers/manufacturers under the EU's carbon pricing rules. Thus, CBAM is effectively a carbon price equalisation measure.\n\nThe key sectors covered under the EU CBAM include iron and steel, aluminium, cement, and fertilisers. Reporting requirements for the EU CBAM began on 1 January 2024, with quarterly submissions for the previous quarter. The levy, however, is expected to take effect from 1 January 2026. The UK has also proposed its own CBAM, scheduled to come into force on 1 January 2027, reflecting a broader global shift towards carbon pricing mechanisms. The key sectors covered under the UK CBAM include cement, fertilisers, glass, ceramics, iron and steel, aluminium, and hydrogen. Currently, the EU CBAM addresses only direct emissions from production processes, whereas the proposed UK CBAM intends to cover both direct and indirect emissions. CBAM aims to equalise carbon prices across geographies, thereby negating the comparative advantage of developing members like India and the least developed countries.\n\nThe justification offered for the introduction of CBAM is that it prevents carbon leakage. 37 Some jurisdictions believe that the aggregate impact of the countries' nationally determined contributions, if fully implemented, would not put the world on a pathway to achieving the Paris Agreement goal. Therefore, the logic behind CBAM is that as long as they did not have the same level of ambition, CBAM was necessary to protect the integrity of climate mitigation efforts in Europe and ensure they were not undermined by carbon leakage. Moreover, the\n\n35    The EUDR requires operators and traders to ensure that the products placed in the EU market are (i) deforestationfree (i.e., must not be derived from a land which is deforested after December 31 2020); (ii) should be produced following the relevant legislation of the country where the product is produced; and (iii) covers the submission of a due diligence statement before placing the products in the EU.\n\n36    UNCTAD Global trade Update December 2023, 'Global trade expected to shrink by nearly 5 per cent in 2023 amid geopolitical strains and shifting trade patterns', https://tinyurl.com/5n8ueccb.\n\n37  European Commission Taxation and Customs Union website, https://tinyurl.com/ysbxy866.\n\nproposed ban on steel scrap exports from the EU, a key input for steel production, will significantly hinder developing countries' capacity to produce more carbon-efficient steel. This measure can be perceived as the EU attempting to enjoy the benefits of both sides while also imposing trade restrictions.\n\n## Likely impact on India\n\nThe share of CBAM exports in total Indian exports to the EU has increased substantially from 6.3 per cent in 2014 to 10.5 per cent in 2023. 38  Table III.1 presents the commodity-wise exposure of India's exports to the EU, which are likely to be impacted by CBAM.\n\nTable III.1: India's exposure to CBAM Value of exports (USD million)\n\n|                |   2014 |   2023 |\n|----------------|--------|--------|\n| Iron and steel | 2962.6 | 5557.1 |\n| Aluminium      |  151.4 | 1801   |\n| Cement         |    4.2 |    8.3 |\n| Fertilisers    |    0.7 |    2   |\n\nSource: UNCOMTRADE database (2024)\n\nAccording  to  the  World  Bank's  Relative  CBAM  Exposure  Index 39 ,  India  has  a  score  of 0.03, reflecting a high exposure to CBAM. 40  Countries like India face the twin challenge of  achieving  higher  levels  of  economic  development  and  dealing  with  climate  change mitigation and adaptation. Therefore, the international community must find a balance that supports both environmental sustainability and the economic development needs of developing economies and LDCs, ensuring that multilateralism remains the cornerstone of global trade relations. 41\n\n## European Union Deforestation Regulation\n\nThe EUDR (whose implementation will start at the end of 2025 and in 2026 for smaller businesses) seeks to regulate the consumption of products derived from deforested land. The EUDR places several compliances on the operators and traders of the relevant products\n\n38    'Intermingling  of  Trade  and  Environment  Policy:  Implications  of  EU-CBAM  on  India  and  LDCs',  EPW,  16 November 2024 https://tinyurl.com/yb32jhdp.\n\n39    CBAM exposure index is measured as the mathematical product of two main elements-the share of a country's exports of the CBAM-related product that goes to the EU and the embodied carbon payment per dollar of export to  the  EU,  determined  by  the  carbon  emissions  intensity  of  production  and  the  assumed  cost  of  the  CBAM certificates.CBAM exposure index is measured by multiplying the export share by the embodied carbon payment per dollar of export to the EU (the exporter's emission intensity times $100 per ton carbon price).\n\n40  World Banka data on Relative CBAM Exposure Index, https://tinyurl.com/4hbp64z8.\n\n41  Based on the inputs received from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.\n\ncovered  under  the  regulation. 42 It  requires  the  operators  and  traders  to  ensure  that  the products placed in the EU market are (i) deforestation-free (i.e., must not be derived from a land which is deforested after December 31 2020); (ii) should be produced by the relevant legislation of the country where the product is produced; and (iii) covers the submission of a due diligence statement, including supply chain integrity through an elaborate trace and track system before placing the products in the EU.\n\nThe regulation also entails  devising  a  country-level  benchmarking  system  indicating  the forest degradation and deforestation risk by the EU. The benchmarking system would be based on a three-tier system for classifying countries as low, standard, or high risk, which would be determined based on internationally recognised information and data on whether a  country  is  active  in  reducing  deforestation.  High-risk  countries  would  be  required  to exercise higher due diligence for the relevant products compared to low or standard-risk countries.  This categorisation of countries would be used to identify the checks to be carried out by the EU authorities. High-risk countries would be subject to more rigorous checks than countries categorised as having low-risk. 43\n\nThe regulation covers products such as soy, beef, palm oil, wood, cocoa, coffee, rubber, and their derived products, such as leather, chocolate, tyres, or furniture. 44 It puts the onus of proving compliance on the operator or trader who wishes to sell these products in the EU markets. 45 The costs of complying with the regulation include information requirements, risk assessment, risk mitigation and reporting obligations. These costs are not border measures but affect the competitiveness of a country's exports vis-à-vis other countries' compliance costs. Therefore, the Regulation would change the trade costs (increase) for the EU's trading partners in specific commodities.\n\nAs per a GTRI study 46 , as far as India's exports are concerned, coffee, leather hide and skin preparations, oil  cake,  paper,  paperboard,  and  wood  furniture  could  be  highly  impacted by the Regulation. It also compares the tariff lines covered under the Regulation vis-à-vis\n\n42    The  Regulation defines an 'operator' as natural or legal person who, in the course of a commercial activity, places relevant products on the market or exports them and a 'trader' as any person in the supply chain other than the operator who, in the course of a commercial activity, makes relevant products available on the market.\n\n43    As  per  the  Regulation  dated  31  May  2023,  'In  respect  of  relevant  products  from  countries  or  parts  thereof classified  as  high  risk,  the  respective  operators  and  traders  and  the  volumes  of  their  share  of  relevant commodities and relevant products, a twofold approach that provides comprehensive coverage should apply. Competent authorities should thus be required to check on a certain percentage of operators and traders, whilst also covering a specific percentage of relevant products. In respect of relevant products from countries or parts thereof classified as low or standard risk, competent authorities should be required to check at least a certain percentage of operators and traders. The level of checks should be higher for relevant products from high-risk countries or parts thereof whereas it could be lower for standard or low-risk countries or parts thereof.'\n\n44    The list of products covered under the Regulation is available at Annex I of the Regulation dated 31 May 2023, available at https://tinyurl.com/bddmuysp.\n\n45    Article 2 (15) of the Regulation states, 'An operator is a natural or legal person who places relevant products on the Union market or exports them from the Union market in the course of commercial activity.'\n\n46    GTRI brief dated 1 August 2023, 'Deforestation and Compliance Challenges: A Blow to India's Agri Exports as EU's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) Deadline Looms', https://gtri.co.in/gtriFlagshipRep12.pdf.\n\nCBAM, out of which the latter is wider in its coverage. The CBAM and EUDR are expected to affect USD 9.5 billion of India's exports to the EU, which amounts to 9 per cent of India's exports to the world or 12.9 per cent of India's exports to the EU. The study informs that the regulation effectively encourages local production and export of selected agricultural commodities by erecting more barriers against imports in the name of climate.\n\nAccording to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, around 420 million hectares of forest were lost globally due to deforestation between 1990 and 2020, an area the  size  of  the  EU. 47 In  Europe,  conversion  to  cropland  accounted  for  about  15  per  cent of deforestation during the same time period. 48  European agriculture could not have come up without deforestation, and the imposition of EUDR reeks of double standards. Thus, that  a  region  that  has  resorted  to  significant  deforestation  to  expand  crop  production  is implementing the EUDR to regulate the consumption of products sourced from deforested land, appears quite contradictory, even as it is unsurprising.\n\nIn short, it is hard to shake off the conclusion that both CBAM and EUDR are trade protection measures garbed in the language of climate and environment. The game and the end goals are the same, but the tactics keep changing. Labour standards, gender, democracy, emissions and deforestation, the innovative list will keep evolving with time. Institutions and practices evolve  with  development.  Today's  developed  countries  do  not  conform  to  the  standards that  they  expect  from  developing  countries  at  a  similar  stage  of  development.  But  then, intellectual consistency is not really the goal here.\n\n3.18  NTMs are playing an increasing role in international trade due to a decline in the usage of tariffs worldwide via successive agreements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/WTO and due to growing consumer concerns about food safety, quality, and environmental protection. 49  A UNCTAD report 50  notes that NTMs can serve as legitimate policy instruments, fulfilling important roles such as protecting human health and the environment. In some cases, they may even enhance trade. For instance, when an exporting  country  implements  high  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  standards, consumers in importing countries tend to have greater confidence in the quality of the food products, which can lead to increased demand. Stricter domestic food safety standards can also help local exporters meet the requirements of their trade partners, further boosting trade opportunities.\n\n3.19 Though many NTMs aim primarily to protect public health or the environment, they also adversely impact trade by increasing information, compliance, and procedural costs. This is significant for exporters and importers because accessing and benefiting from markets increasingly depends on adherence to trade regulations, such as sanitary\n\n47  United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, https://tinyurl.com/3fzythxj.\n\n48  https://tinyurl.com/44mu2hnj.\n\n49  UNCTAD document, 'non-tariff measures: definitions and basic facts', https://tinyurl.com/y7hwd55u.\n\n50    UNCTAD  report,  'Trade  costs  of  non-tariff  measures  now  more  than  double  that  of  tariffs,'  https://tinyurl. com/55tk5fut.\n\nstandards  and  product  quality  requirements.  For  instance,  a  regulation  that  limits pesticide residues in food products seeks to achieve a significant public health goal of protecting human health and nutrition. However, this regulation imposes additional compliance  requirements  on  firms  in  exporting  countries,  and  some  may  find  that exporting  is  no  longer  profitable.  Consequently,  such  regulations  can  restrict  trade, leading to lower incomes in exporting countries and higher prices for consumers in importing  countries.  This  issue  mainly  affects  smaller  exporters  and  low-income countries, as they often bear a disproportionate burden from these NTMs. 51\n\n3.20  NTMs can indirectly affect FDI through their impact on imports. A firm might decide to bypass an NTM by engaging in FDI if the costs associated with this approach are lower than the costs of exporting. Additionally, NTMs can encourage inward FDI to the country that imposes them, as these measures raise barriers to market access. Research has demonstrated that NTMs have a positive impact on FDI. For example, if the average number of NTMs applied to a product increases from 2.5 to 3.5 NTMs per product, FDI could increase by 12 per cent. Certain NTMs, such as intellectual property rights, local content requirements, and TBT in specific sectors, appear to affect FDI significantly. 52",
