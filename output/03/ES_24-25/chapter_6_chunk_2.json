  "content": "Chapter 6 Summary:\nThe chapter emphasizes the importance of infrastructure development in India's growth aspirations, with a focus on increasing public spending, creating institutions to de-bottleneck approvals, and innovative modes of resource mobilization. In FY25, capital expenditure gathered momentum post-elections, with a focus on sustainable construction practices and increasing private participation. The government has launched several initiatives, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), and PM-Gati Shakti, to promote infrastructure development. Key sectors such as railways, road transport, civil aviation, ports, and power have shown significant growth, with investments in physical connectivity, digital connectivity, and urban infrastructure. The chapter highlights the need for continued infrastructure investment, sustainable practices, and private participation to achieve India's growth objectives.\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Infrastructure Capex Improves Post-Election\n\n## INFRASTRUCTURE CAPEX IMPROVES POST-ELECTION\n\n6.5 The pace of the Union Government's capital expenditure in major infrastructure sectors 6 was affected during Q1FY25, largely due to the model code of conduct during the general elections. The unusual patterns of the last monsoon season also slowed down the progress of work. Hence, a year-over-year comparison may not be appropriate for Q1FY25.\n\n5 NITI Aayog (2021, August 10).

Capex in infrastructure sectors is expected to gain further momentum in the remaining months of the current fiscal. On an average, ministries related to infrastructure sectors utilised 60 per cent of the budgeted capex during April to November 2024. This compares favourably with the progress achieved in the same period in FY20 when the 17th Lok Sabha elections were held.",
