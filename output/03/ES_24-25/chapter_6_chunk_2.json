  "content": "Chapter 6 Summary:\nThe chapter emphasizes the importance of infrastructure development in India's growth aspirations, with a focus on increasing public spending, creating institutions to de-bottleneck approvals, and innovative modes of resource mobilization. In FY25, capital expenditure gathered momentum post-elections, with a focus on sustainable construction practices and increasing private participation. The government has launched several initiatives, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), and PM GatiShakti, to promote infrastructure development. Key policy recommendations include increasing private participation, improving project conceptualization, and developing sector-specific strategies. The chapter highlights progress in physical connectivity, including railways, road transport, civil aviation, ports, and shipping. It also discusses digital connectivity, rural infrastructure, and urban infrastructure development. The government has introduced several initiatives to promote tourism infrastructure, space infrastructure, and sustainable development. The chapter concludes that continued infrastructure investment is crucial for sustaining high growth, and public-private partnerships are essential for meeting infrastructure requirements.\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Urban Infrastructure\n\nurban infrastructure needs: Constraints to commercial financing and prospects for policy action.

The National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) was launched with a forward-looking approach, targeting a projected infrastructure investment of around ₹111 lakh crore from FY20 to FY25. The NIP serves as a centralised platform for hosting projects of states, union territories and central ministries to facilitate their monitoring and review. Currently, it encompasses over 9,766 projects and schemes across 37 sub-sectors. These projects are tracked and reviewed through the integrated India Investment Grid (NIP-Project Monitoring Group) portal.\n\n6.3 The government is bringing in innovative frameworks for attracting investment in infrastructure projects. To boost private investment in brownfield assets, the National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP) was launched in August 2021. This initiative laid down the  framework  for  monetisation  policy  and  identified  a  pipeline  of  potential  core assets with an indicative value of ₹6.0 lakh crore for the period FY22 to FY25 5 .  For the period FY22 to FY24, against the target of ₹4.30 lakh crore, transactions of ₹3.86 lakh crore in terms of accruals or private investments were completed under the core asset monetisation. Sector-wise, roads, power, coal, and mines led the performance, supported by market-tested models and reforms. For FY25, the aggregate monetisation target is set at ₹1.91 lakh crore.\n\n6.4 Despite  such  earnest  efforts  by  the  union  government  and  quite  a  few  state governments and public sector undertakings supplementing these efforts with increased capex,  there  is  still  a  significant  unmet  demand  for  infrastructure  development. While this is typical of a dynamic, developing economy, India's goal of Viksit Bharat necessitates the progressive filling of this gap with innovative modes of financing and greater private participation. This sets the context for the discussion in this chapter.\n\n##",
