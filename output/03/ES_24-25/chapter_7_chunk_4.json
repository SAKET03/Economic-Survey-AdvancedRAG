  "content": "Chapter 7 Summary:\nThe global manufacturing landscape has undergone significant shifts over the past decade, with India gaining a greater presence. A strategic emphasis on public capital formation and logistic improvements has underpinned this achievement. However, challenges such as geopolitical tensions, aggressive industrial and trade policies, supply chain disruptions, and global trade slowdown have posed a challenge to export demand for India's manufactured products. Industries like steel, cement, chemicals, and petrochemicals have stabilized industrial growth, while consumer-focused sectors like automobiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals have emerged as growth drivers. To drive growth, fostering R&D investments, innovations, and enhancing the growth and formalization of smaller manufacturers will be crucial. State-level analysis indicates that business reforms in states are likely to foster industrial development. India needs sustained and coordinated efforts from all tiers of government, the private sector, the skilling ecosystem, academia, and R&D institutions to become a strong manufacturing power. The global manufacturing space has seen high-income countries lose a significant part of their share over the last decade, mainly gained by upper-middle-income countries, particularly China. India has a large opportunity to climb up the ladder, with 2.8% of the global share in manufacturing compared to China's 28.8%. India also has a substantial scope to improve the contribution of the industrial sector in GDP. The IMF observes that manufacturing production is increasingly shifting towards emerging market economies, particularly China and India. India stands a good chance of benefiting from the trends in global industrial diversification. The industrial sector was significantly affected by the pandemic, leading to a contraction in FY21, but growth fluctuations have been seen in subsequent years. Industrial growth has declined to 3.6% in Q2 of FY25 due to factors like manufacturing exports slowdown, monsoon impacts, and statistical downward bias in growth figures. Core input industries like cement, steel, and chemicals have shown growth, with cement production at around 427 million tonnes in FY24 and steel production registering a growth of 3.3% and 4.6% in April-November of FY25. The chemical and petrochemical sector's share in GVA of the manufacturing sector was 9.5% during FY23. The capital goods sector has shown robust growth, with the production of capital goods fluctuating between FY20 and FY23 before recording growth in FY24. The automobile industry has recorded domestic sales growth of 12.5% in FY24, and the electronics industry has seen significant growth, with domestic production increasing from ₹1.90 lakh crore in FY15 to ₹9.52 lakh crore in FY24. The pharmaceutical industry is the world's third-largest by volume, with a diverse product portfolio and strong global presence. India's R&D ecosystem has shown improvement, with patent filings increasing, and the country ranking sixth among the top 10 patent filing offices globally. However, India lags in R&D, with a significant gap across major sectors, and the gross expenditure on research & development (GERD) in India has increased from approximately ₹60,196 crore in FY11 to about ₹127,381 crore in FY21. The MSME sector plays a crucial role in India's progress, employing 23.24 crore individuals as of November 2024. The government has launched initiatives like the Udyam Registration Portal and the Udyam Assist Platform to simplify the process of registering MSMEs and enable ease of doing business. To facilitate credit to MSMEs, a revamp of the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) was undertaken with ₹9,000 crore in the corpus of the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for MSEs. The government has also launched the Self-Reliant India (SRI) Fund with a corpus of ₹50,000 crore to provide equity funding to MSMEs with the potential to scale up. Developmental disparities across states have always been a matter of keen attention, bringing convergence of per capita incomes and living standards to policy focus. Four states - Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu - account for about 43% of the total industrial GSVA. There is a need for focus on industrial strategies appropriate to unique geographies like the North East. Research papers highlight that state-level policies play a crucial role in shaping the economic growth patterns across Indian states. The Business Reform Action Plan (BRAP) formulated by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade aims to assess and enhance the ease of doing business across states. A close connection between industrial and service sectors is indicated by the increasing 'servicification' of industrial output and exports. States should focus on business reforms on a priority basis to achieve buoyancies in some industrial or service sectors where it has natural advantages.\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Core Input Industries\n\n## CORE INPUT INDUSTRIES\n\n## Cement\n\n7.8 Currently, India is the second largest cement producer in the world after China 7 . The Indian cement industry comprises 159 integrated large cement plants, 128 grinding units, five clinkerization units and 62 mini cement plants. The current annual installed capacity of the cement industry is about 639 million tonnes, with cement production of around 427 million tonnes in FY24. Most of the cement plants in India are located in proximity to the raw material source. About 87 per cent of the cement industry is concentrated  in  the  States  of  Rajasthan,  Andhra  Pradesh,  Telangana,  Karnataka, Madhya  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Tamil  Nadu,  Maharashtra,  Uttar  Pradesh,  Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Meghalaya and West Bengal. The industry has adequate capacity to meet the domestic cement demand. Domestic cement consumption is around 290 kg per capita\n\nagainst a global average of 540 kilograms per capita. The government's focus on mega projects like highways, railways, and housing schemes, coupled with rural development and industrial growth, is expected to fuel significant cement demand.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7.9 The cement industry carries an environmental footprint. The industry has been actively working to reduce its carbon emissions of cement by 2070.\n\n## Steel Industry\n\n7.10 In April-November of FY25, the country's crude steel and finished steel production registered a growth of 3.3 per cent and 4.6 per cent. There has been an overall upward trend in steel production and consumption during April-November FY25 despite some month-on-month fluctuations.\n\n7.11  The sustained growth in steel sector was fuelled by ongoing development projects and  increased  public  infrastructure  spending.  The  primary  drivers  of  steel  demand included  expansion  in  end-user  sectors  and  the  implementation  of  policies  like  the National Steel Policy and Production-Linked Incentive schemes. Government initiatives on housing, urban and rural infrastructure also contributed to the rising demand 9 .\n\n8 MTPA (Million Tonnes Per Annum).\n\n9  https://t.ly/R0Lzj.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7.12   Driven  by  an  infrastructure-focused  growth  strategy,  steel  demand  in  India is  expanding  at  a  strong  pace.  This  growth  is  further  bolstered  by  significant advancements  in  key  user  industries,  particularly  building  &amp;  construction,  and infrastructure. In FY24,  construction, and infrastructure accounted for an estimated 68 per cent of total steel consumption, followed by engineering and packaging at 22 per cent and automobiles at nine per cent. India has been a net importer of steel from April to November FY25. The decline in India's export of finished steel during FY25 was mainly driven by gaps between international and domestic prices. The low price in the international market during this period resulted in a low margin on exports and cheaper imports.\n\n7.13    The  government's Steel's Scrap Recycling Policy encourages efficient recycling of scrap. The total domestic consumption of steel scrap in India is approximately 30 Million  Tonnes  (MT),  of  which  around  5  MT  is  imported.  Ensuring  the  availability of high-quality scrap in sufficient quantities is crucial for transitioning to green steel and supporting the future growth of the steel industry. In addition, the use of scrap significantly reduces specific energy consumption. It also reduces the water consumption by 40 per cent, and greenhouse gas emissions by 58 per cent 10 .\n\n## Chemical and Petrochemical Sector\n\n7.14 The share of chemicals and chemical products sector in the GVA of manufacturing sector (at 2011-12 prices) was 9.5 per cent during FY23. The country is a net importer of these products, with a dependence on imports of around 45 per cent of petrochemical intermediates 11 .  Reducing  the  gap  between  domestic  demand  and  supply  is  a  high priority.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n<!-- image -->",
