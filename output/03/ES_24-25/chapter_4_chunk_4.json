  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nThe chapter discusses the dynamics of inflation, particularly in the context of India and the global economy. It highlights that global inflation peaked at 8.7% in 2022 due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions but has since declined. In India, retail inflation eased in FY25 due to government and Reserve Bank of India interventions, with core inflation reaching its lowest point in a decade. Food inflation remains a challenge, driven by supply chain disruptions, adverse weather conditions, and price pressures in vegetables and pulses. The chapter emphasizes the need for robust data systems, climate-resilient crops, and policy measures to ensure long-term price stability. Key statistics include: global inflation at 5.7% in 2024, India's retail inflation at 4.9% in FY25, food inflation at 4.3% when excluding vegetables and pulses, and the significant impact of extreme weather events on vegetable production and prices. The chapter concludes with policy recommendations to address inflationary pressures and ensure food security.\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Outlook and Way Forward\n\n## OUTLOOK AND WAY FORWARD\n\n4.22. The RBI and the IMF have projected that India's consumer price inflation will progressively align towards the inflation target in FY26. In the December 2024 RBI's Monetary Policy Committee report revised its inflation projection from 4.5 per cent to 4.8 per cent in FY25. Assuming a normal monsoon and no further external or policy shocks, the RBI expects headline inflation to be 4.2 per cent in FY26. IMF has projected an inflation rate of 4.4 per cent in FY25 and 4.1 per cent in FY26 for India.\n\n4.23.  As per World Bank's Commodity Markets Outlook 12 , October 2024, commodity prices are expected to decrease by 5.1 per cent in 2025 and 1.7 per cent in 2026. The projected declines are led by oil prices but tempered by price increases for natural gas and a stable outlook for metals and agricultural raw materials. Among precious metals, gold prices are expected to decrease while silver prices are expected to increase. Prices for metals and minerals are expected to decline, primarily due to a decrease in iron ore\n\n12  Commodity Markets Outlook, World Bank, October 2024, (https://tinyurl.com/dyduh9tu)\n\nand zinc prices. In general, the downward trend movement in the prices of commodities imported by India is a positive for the domestic inflation outlook.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n4.24. A  normal  southwest  monsoon  in  2024  has  improved  the  water  levels  in reservoirs, ensuring sufficient water for irrigation during the rabi crop production. As per the first advanced estimates of agricultural production for 2024-25, Kharif food grain production is expected to increase by 5.7 per cent. The production of rice and tur, the most important Kharif food grains, is expected to increase by 5.9 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively, as compared to 2023-24. This could lead to softening of food inflation pressures over the course of the year. However, rising international vegetable oil prices may pose an upside risk to food inflation. The government has focused on controlling food inflation through various supply side measures, which include strengthening the buffer stock of essential food items and periodic open market releases, subsidised retail sale of essential food items in specified outlets, easing imports of the essential food items through rationalisation of duties, prevention of hoarding through imposition/ revision and monitoring of stock limits. The budget 2024-25 has envisaged measures like large-scale clusters for vegetable production, promotion of farmer-prodcuer organisations, cooperatives and start-ups for vegetable supply chains and measures for achieving self-sufficiecny in pulses and oilseeds.\n\n4.25.  The following options may be worth considering from the perspective of ensuring long-term price stability.\n\n- ¾ India faces a persistent deficit in the production of pulses and oilseeds, along with frequent fluctuations in tomato and onion production, leading to price pressures. To address this, focused research is needed to develop climate-resilient crop varieties, enhancing yield and reducing crop damage. Efforts to expand the area under pulses in rice-fallow regions are likely to help.\n\n- ¾ Promoting extension activities is crucial. Farmers should receive training on best practices, the use of high-yield and disease-resistant seed varieties, and targeted interventions to improve agricultural practices in the major growing regions for pulses, tomatoes, and onions.\n- ¾ Implementing robust data collection and analysis systems to monitor prices, stocks, and storage and processing facilities is essential in various tiers of government. This data should be used to identify areas for improvement and make informed policy decisions. High-frequency price monitoring data for essential food items collected by various agencies within the country may be linked to quantify and monitor price build-up at each stage from the farm gate to the final consumer.\n\n******",
