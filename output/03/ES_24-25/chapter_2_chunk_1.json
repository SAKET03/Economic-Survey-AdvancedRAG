  "content": "Chapter 2 Summary:\nIndia's monetary and financial sectors have performed well in the first nine months of FY25. Bank credit has grown steadily, converging towards deposit growth. Scheduled commercial banks' (SCBs) profitability has improved due to a fall in gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) and a rise in the capital-to-risk weighted asset ratio (CRAR). The Financial Inclusion Index increased from 53.9 in March 2021 to 64.2 in March 2024. Rural Financial Institutions (RFIs) and Development Financial Institutions (DFIs) have contributed significantly to financial inclusion and economic progress. The capital markets have demonstrated strong performance, driving capital formation and supporting wealth creation. The insurance and pension sectors continue to perform with the vision of achieving universal coverage. The financial sector is undergoing a transformative period marked by emerging trends such as an increase in consumer credit and equity-based financing. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has kept the policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5% and changed the policy stance from 'withdrawal of accommodation' to 'neutral'. The RBI also announced a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) to 4% to infuse liquidity into the banking system. The monetary base (M0) recorded a year-on-year growth of 3.6% as of January 3, 2025, while M3 growth was 9.3% as of December 27, 2024. The money multiplier (MM) stood at 5.7 as of December 27, 2024. The GNPA ratio of SCBs declined to a 12-year low of 2.6% at the end of September 2024. The restructured standard advances (RSA) ratio for SCBs declined from 1.8% to 0.7% at the end of September 2024. The CRAR of SCBs increased to 16.7% at the end of September 2024. The profitability of SCBs improved, with profit after tax surging by 22.2% in H1 of FY25. Bank deposits continue to exhibit double-digit growth, while credit growth has moderated to 11.8% as of November 2024. The growth in non-food credit was 7.5% compared to 11% in the same period last year. The credit/GDP ratio indicates that the recent growth in bank credit is sustainable. RFIs, including Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Rural Cooperative Banks (RCBs), and Small Finance Banks, play a vital role in ensuring inclusive growth through financial inclusion and credit accessibility. RRBs have expanded their reach, with 43 RRBs having 22,069 branches and operations extending to 31.3 crore deposit accounts and 3 crore loan accounts. The government approved ₹10,890 crore in recapitalisation assistance to RRBs during FY22 and FY23. DFIs, such as IIFCL and NaBFID, have supported infrastructure development and provided long-term funding for key sectors. IIFCL has sanctioned loans for over 780 projects with a total outlay of over ₹13.9 lakh crore. NaBFID has sanctioned ₹1.3 lakh crore loans as of September 30, 2024, with a target of sanctioning over ₹3 lakh crore by the end of FY26. Banks have adapted to the latest technological innovations, including artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), to redefine customer interactions and enhance decision-making speed and accuracy.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n2.1 Financial institutions play a pivotal role in shaping a country's economic growth trajectory by facilitating savings, investments, and credit for economic activities. The prevailing monetary policies influence the interplay between financial intermediation and  economic  growth.  This  chapter  examines  the  key  trends  and  policy  changes in  monetary  policy  and  the  financial  intermediation  ecosystem  in  India.  These developments are shaped by evolving domestic and global factors, including inflation trends, economic activity projections, and interest rate movements in major economies like the US, EU, and Japan.\n\n2.2 The chapter is structured into two parts. The first part of the chapter explores the evolving monetary policy and key indicators such as Reserve Money (M0), Broad Money  (M3)  and  Money  Multiplier  (MM),  among  others.  The  second  part  focuses on the various developments in the financial sector. It begins with an analysis of the banking  sector's  performance  and  credit  availability,  including  the  contributions  of RFIs and DFIs to economic growth. The next section under the discussion on 'financial sector developments' examines capital market trends, particularly the rise in investor participation  in  the  equity  segment.  Subsequent  sections  cover  developments  in the  insurance  and  pension  sectors,  followed  by  an  overview  of  the  role  of  financial sector  regulators  in  maintaining  financial  stability.  The  chapter  also  discusses  the government's mechanism for addressing cybersecurity in the financial sector and the role of the Financial Stability and Development Council (FSDC). It concludes with a financial sector outlook, highlighting key challenges for the future.",
