The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, reassuring them of a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the use of drones and fertigation techniques to optimize fertilizer applications. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has been introduced to enable farmers to meet their short-term working capital requirements promptly and hassle-free. The government has also launched the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) to provide insurance for farmers against crop losses due to natural calamities, pests, and diseases. The agricultural extension services have been strengthened to disseminate knowledge, enhance productivity, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. The government has also promoted private investment in agricultural marketing infrastructure through initiatives such as the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme. The food processing industry in India is one of the largest employers within organized manufacturing, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated several key programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The government has also implemented various initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). India's agricultural sector remains a crucial pillar for economic growth and ensuring food security for the nation, with significant potential for growth and development.\n\nSubchapter 12 Content:\n# Food Processing Industries: Critical for the Economy\n\nFOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES: Critical for the Economy\n\n9.49 The food processing industry in India is one of the largest  employers  within organised  manufacturing,  accounting  for  12.41  per  cent  of  total  employment  in  the organised sector. In the fiscal year FY24, the value of agri-food exports, which includes processed food exports, reached USD 46.44 billion, constituting roughly 11.7 per cent of India's total exports. Notably, the share of processed food exports within agri-food exports has risen from 14.9 per cent in FY18 to 23.4 per cent in FY24.\n\n9.50 To  foster  growth  in  the  food  processing  sector,  the  Indian  government  has initiated several key programs, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY). This scheme focuses on developing modern infrastructure and optimising supply  chains  from  farm  to  retail.  By  minimising  post-harvest  losses,  increasing processing  capabilities,  and  enhancing  export  levels,  PMKSY  aims  to  promote  the overall  advancement  of  the  food  processing  industry.  As  of  31  October  2024,  1,079 PMKSY projects have been completed.\n\n9.51 The  Production  Linked  Incentive  Scheme  for  Food  Processing  (PLISFPI), launched in 2021, seeks to cultivate globally competitive food processing leaders by facilitating branding and marketing initiatives in international markets. By 31 October 2024,  171  applications  had  been  approved  under  this  scheme,  with  beneficiaries investing ₹8,910 crore and receiving ₹1,084.01 crore in incentives.\n\n9.52 Furthermore, to provide comprehensive support-including technical, financial, and business assistance for establishing or upgrading micro food processing enterprises-the Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME)  scheme  was  launched  in  2020.  As  of  31  October  2024,  the  scheme  has received 407,819 applications, with loans totalling ₹8.63 thousand crore sanctioned to 108,580 applicants. Additionally, the programme has successfully trained 672 Master Trainers, 1,120 District Level Trainers, and 87,477 beneficiaries across 36 states and union territories.\n\n##",
