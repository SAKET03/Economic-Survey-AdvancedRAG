  "content": "Chapter 8 Summary:\nThe service sector has been a significant contributor to India's GDP growth, particularly in FY25, where it propped up growth when manufacturing was affected by global merchandise trade dampening. Services exports play a critical role in strengthening India's external balance, and the 'servicification' of the industrial sector adds to its importance. Logistics services have regained pre-pandemic momentum, enhancing user experience through digitization. India continues to be an important partner in the global technology landscape through the adoption of digital technologies in business processes. Initiatives like Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) are making these transformations more inclusive. Equipping the labor force with requisite skills and creating an enabling environment through simple and transparent processes of grassroots-level governance will help realize the full potential of commercial services and build resilience to global headwinds. The service sector's value-added accounts for about 62% of global GDP, and services have been the growth engine for middle-income countries like China, Thailand, and India in the last decade. India's services sector has been the steadiest contributor to GVA, with its contribution to total GVA at current prices increasing from 50.6% in FY14 to about 55% in FY25. It provides employment to approximately 30% of the workforce. The growth in the service sector, as measured by YoY change in real GVA by services, has been above 6% in each year in the last decade, except for the Covid-19 pandemic-affected FY21. The average services growth rate before the pandemic was 8%, and the average services growth in the post-pandemic year, i.e., FY23 to FY25, has risen to 8.3%. Public administration services have accounted for a share in the range of 11-12% of the total services GVA during FY13 to FY23. Information and computer-related services had the maximum buoyancy among the services during the last decade, growing at a trend rate of 12.8% during FY13 to FY23. The Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) - services shows that the service sector remained in the expansionary zone for 41 consecutive months since August 2021. The export of services grew at a trend rate of 11% during FY14 to FY23, at constant prices. Computer services and business services exports account for around 70% of India's services exports. India's services export growth accelerated to 12.8% in April-November FY25 from 5.7% in FY24. In April-November FY25, services imports grew by 13.9%, in contrast to a decline of 2.9% during the same period in FY24. Total outstanding bank credit to the services sector stands at Rs. 48.5 lakh crore as of November 2024. The YoY growth in credit to the services sector was recorded at 13%. Within the service sector, computer software and professional services recorded the highest YoY credit growth at 22.5% and 19.4%, respectively. FDI equity inflows stood at USD 29.8 billion in FY25 (April-September), while the services sector witnessed USD 5.7 billion inflow in the same period. The Indian Railways' passenger traffic achieved a growth of 8% over the previous year, and revenue-earning freight in FY24 achieved a growth of 5.2%. The government is taking steps to upgrade passenger amenities, including providing train indication boards, coach guidance systems, digital clocks, and public address systems at various stations. Wi-Fi facilities have been provided at 6112 stations to date. A new policy for the management of mobile catering services was introduced in 2023. E-ticketing has touched 86% in the reserved sector as of October 2024. The passenger reservation system is being redeveloped using cloud-native technologies. Bharat Gaurav trains have been introduced as theme-based tourist circuit trains showcasing India's rich cultural heritage and historical places. Under this scheme, 325 trips of Bharat Gaurav trains carrying 1,91,033 tourists have been operated, covering various tourist destinations. The tourism sector's contribution to GDP regained the pre-pandemic level of 5% in FY23. The tourism sector created 7.6 crore jobs in FY23. International tourist arrivals in India have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. The share of India's international tourist arrivals in world ITAs stands at 1.45% in 2023. Foreign exchange earnings through tourism were USD 28 billion. India received 1.8% of world tourism receipts and attained a rank of 14th worldwide in world tourism receipts during 2023. India's real estate market witnessed robust performance under office demand and residential sales driven by economic stability and positive market sentiment. The demand for real estate is emerging not only in tier 1 and tier 2 cities but across the country due to the expansion of metro networks, enhancement to road networks, and improvements in connectivity. Housing demand in India is expected to touch 93 million units by 2036. The rise of real estate investment trusts (REITs) further amplifies the positive trajectory of the commercial sector. The residential real estate market scaled an 11-year high in sales volume in the first six months of 2024. The Indian IT/ITeS industry has a leading position globally and has been a significant contributor to the growth of exports. The industry has estimated revenues of USD 254 billion, marking a 3.8% YoY growth in FY24. Tech exports reached nearly USD 200 billion, reflecting a growth of 3.3%, while the domestic market is expected to expand by 5.9%, crossing USD 54 billion in FY24. The sector maintained its position as a net hirer, adding 60,000 employees to reach a workforce of 5.43 million in FY24. The abolition of the angel tax is expected to boost the country's global innovation and entrepreneurial competitiveness. Expanding the scope of safe harbor rules and streamlining transfer pricing assessment procedures are expected to make the country's transfer pricing regime more attractive and competitive. India's telecom sector is expanding with the smartphone boom, surging data consumption, and the advent of technologies like 5G. India stands as the second-largest telecommunications market, with over 1.18 billion telephone subscribers, an overall teledensity of 84%, and 941 million broadband users as of October 31, 2024. The country also leads in mobile data consumption per subscriber and offers the world's most affordable data rates. India's achievement of the fastest 5G rollout globally highlights its technological prowess in the telecom sector. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) represents a paradigm shift, promoting a democratic and interoperable digital commerce ecosystem, thus fostering inclusivity and equity. ONDC enables buyers and sellers to transact seamlessly across different platforms. It helps by reducing customer acquisition costs, enhancing business efficiencies, and expanding choices for merchants and consumers. ONDC recorded more than 14 million transactions in November 2024 across 1100+ cities. Over 7 lakh sellers and service providers are active on the ONDC network spread across 600+ cities and towns across India. 190+ network participants are live on the network. Presently, over 7000 farmer producer organizations (FPOs) have registered to be a part of the ONDC network through various seller network participants. Around 400 self-help groups (SHGs), micro-entrepreneurs, and social sector enterprises have been onboarded on the network. Mobility through the ONDC network is live in 15+ cities with around 5.45 lakh taxi and auto drivers onboarded. The platform today has 10 active domains, 110 network participants, and close to 6.5 lakh sellers/service providers. It has attracted an increasing number of transactions since its launch. The service sector accounts for about 55% of the national GVA in FY25. However, the distribution of service sector activity across Indian states reveals a pronounced geographic dispersion. For FY23, Karnataka and Maharashtra account for more than one-fourth of the total service sector GSVA of all the states. These states along with Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat together share more than 50% of the total service sector GSVA. These states also have more than 50% of the total industrial GSVA, suggesting that both feed into each other. On the other hand, another set of 19 states collectively account for only one-fourth of the service sector GSVA of all the states. Public administration is a unique category that reflects the strength of the state machinery in the state. This is majorly determined by the strength of the state's own revenues, central transfers including tax devolution and borrowing of the state, which together define the spending capacity of the state. This is independent of other services which are largely commercially driven. There are four different scenarios in the relationship between services share in total GSVA and services GSVA per capita. States like Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, and Mizoram have more than a third of their services GSVA coming from trade, repair, hotels, and restaurants, partly because of tourism. Many bigger states have trade and repair intensity of close to or higher than the national average indicating a large presence of low-value-adding trade in these states. Many of these states are relatively less industrialized also. Financial, real estate, and professional services have very high levels of concentration in a few states. Within the service sector, financial services are highly concentrated with Maharashtra (Mumbai), Tamil Nadu, Gujarat (GIFT City), and Karnataka accounting for more than 50% of total financial services GSVA. Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Haryana, Tamil Nadu have more than one-third of their services GSVA coming from real estate, ownership of dwelling & professional services. The states like Karnataka, Telangana, and Kerala excel in services, with high per-capita service GSVA and service shares in GSVA but exhibit only around average industrial per capita GSVA. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu typically represent states with reasonably strong industrial and service sectors. Their diversified economies integrate manufacturing with trade, financial services, real estate & professional services. States with reform potential include Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. As per DPIIT's Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP), which ranks states based on their performance in introducing business reforms, the states with service intensity backed by industry are the states which have introduced larger numbers of reforms in comparison to their peer states and fall in top achiever and achiever's category. Thus, introducing business reforms is essential to industrial as well as service development in the state. As per the annual survey of unincorporated sector enterprises 2022-23, the number of estimated enterprises belonging to the unincorporated sector stands at 6.5 crore. 72.6% of these enterprises operate in the service sector. Many states like Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have a substantial presence of these enterprises. These enterprises, though contributing to the overall development of the economy in terms of employment and income, are losing out on benefits normally offered by incorporation such as tax benefits, and credibility which could help them build better client relationships, access to credit and durability which would help them provide continuity to their business operations etc. States, through policy nudges reducing compliance difficulties, can accelerate the incorporation of these enterprises.\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Business Services\n\n## BUSINESS SERVICES\n\n## Information Technology (IT) Services\n\n8.28   The  Indian  IT/  ITeS  industry  has  a  leading  position  globally  and  has  been  a significant  contributor  to  the  growth  of  exports.  According  to  NASSCOM  Strategic Review Report 2024, India's tech industry 14  demonstrated extraordinary resilience in FY24, amidst macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical tensions. The industry has estimated revenues of USD 254 billion, marking a 3.8 per cent YoY growth in FY24 (excluding e-commerce).  Tech exports reached nearly USD 200 billion, reflecting a growth of 3.3 per cent, while the domestic market is expected to expand by 5.9 per cent, crossing USD 54 billion in FY24. The sector maintained its position as a net hirer, adding 60,000 employees to reach a workforce of 5.43 million in FY24.\n\n8.29  The abolition of the angel tax (on investments made by investors in startups) is expected to boost the country's global innovation and entrepreneurial competitiveness. Expanding the scope of safe harbour rules and streamlining transfer pricing assessment procedures are expected to make the country's transfer pricing regime more attractive and competitive, boost IT exports, and ease business for Global Capability Centres and the IT services industry. Other reforms include the abolition of the 2 per cent equalisation levy, reduction in tax deduction at source on payment made by e-commerce operators to e-commerce participants, relief from GST on data centre exports, reduction of rate of tax collection at source to be collected by e-commerce operators etc.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n14    Tech  industry  revenues  include  information  technology  services,  business  process  management,  engineering research and development, software products, and hardware.\n\n## Global Capability Centers\n\n8.30  India's Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are emerging as strategic hubs reshaping the  Indian  corporate  landscape  while  influencing  global  business  dynamics.  The number of GCCs in India has grown from approximately 1430 in FY19 to over 1700 in FY24. As of FY24, GCCs in India employ nearly 1.9 million professionals. Over the past five years, India has remained at the forefront of the global GCC expansion strategy, with more than 400 new GCCs and around 1100 new units established.\n\n8.31  GCCs are fundamentally altering the technology landscape. Leading organisations are centralising their tech ecosystems in India. This is particularly evident in sectors like  aerospace,  defence,  and  semiconductors,  where  companies  are  advancing  their engineering efforts to focus on next-generation platforms, products, and technologies. Over the last five years, the setup rate of engineering research &amp; development GCCs has grown 1.3 times faster than the overall GCC setup, highlighting a continued shift towards high-value-added work.\n\n8.32   India  has  established  itself  as  a  prominent  player  in  leveraging  its  vast  talent pool, which accounts for 28 per cent of the global (science, technology, engineering, mathematics)  STEM  workforce  and  23  per  cent  of  the  global  software  engineering talent. Over the past decade, the GCC ecosystem in India has matured significantly, advancing into high-end engineering roles such as product managers and architects, with 35 per cent of transformation hubs exhibiting a strong presence of architects 15 . Furthermore, global roles within GCCs are expanding rapidly, expected to grow from currently 6,500 to over 30,000 by 2030, supported by robust training programs to develop leadership. The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML)  and  the  establishment  of  AI  centres  of  excellence  further  enhance  the  GCC landscape by tapping into India's strong middle-management talent.\n\n## Box VIII.3: AI adoption in the services sector in India\n\nThe services sector, including banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI), healthcare, telecom, retail, and transport and logistics, stands out for its rapid AI adoption, supported by various national initiatives and technologies.\n\nFinance: Several financial institutions and banks in India are using AI to enhance their operations,  improve  customer  experiences,  and  streamline  their  services.  For  example, SBI Intelligent Assistant (SIA) by SBI is a chatbot used to provide support to customers. Banks are also using AI for fraud detection and risk management. ML algorithms are used to identify suspicious transactions by analysing customer data.\n\nTelecom: AI improves customer support, network optimisation, and predictive maintenance. Several telecom companies in India are leveraging AI to improve their services, optimize operations, and enhance customer experience. For example, AI-driven platforms\n\n15  Nasscom Strategic Review Report 2024\n\nfor  end-to-end  telecom  network  management.  Built  on  top  of  state-of-the-art  big  data architecture touching upon every aspect of the network - from the core and radio to the business  functions  of  a  telecom  service  provider  are  being  used.  Cloud-native  data  lake platform tailored for carriers to enable smarter operations through ML as a service are also being used. They leverage ML to detect anomalous network patterns and create reports and alert  based on these patterns for proactive root cause analysis and resolution before the network symptoms start affecting operations.\n\nRetail  and  e-commerce: AI  enables  personalised  marketing,  inventory  management, and customer experience enhancement. The fashion e-commerce giants are using advanced features to enable customers to have an enhanced and discovery-led shopping experience.\n\nTransport and logistics: AI  applications  streamline  operations  and  improve  delivery accuracy, helping companies cut costs and enhance customer satisfaction. AI is used for route planning and optimization to ensure timely delivery of packages. AI-based robotic systems are being used in their fulfilment centres to streamline the sorting, packaging, and inventory management processes, reducing human intervention and increasing efficiency.\n\n## Telecommunication\n\n8.33   India's  telecom  sector  is  expanding  with  the  smartphone  boom,  surging  data consumption,  and  the  advent  of  technologies  like  5G.  India  stands  as  the  secondlargest  telecommunications market, with over 1.18 billion telephone subscribers, an overall teledensity of 84 per cent, and 941 million broadband users 16  as of 31st October, 2024. The country also leads in mobile data consumption per subscriber and offers the world's most affordable data rates. India's achievement of the fastest 5G rollout globally highlights its technological prowess in the telecom sector.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.34   There  has  been  a  paradigm  shift  in  India's  telecom  technology  space  that underscores an ongoing effective transition from a technology importer to a technology developer and exporter.\n\n## Box VIII.4: C-DOT- the catalyst of India's telecom revolution\n\nThe Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) has been committed to research and development of indigenous solutions and reducing dependency on foreign technologies.\n\nC-DOT has consistently spearheaded next-generation telecom technologies:\n\n4G  and  5G  core  networks: C-DOT has  been  instrumental  in  developing  indigenous 4G and 5G core solutions, reducing reliance on global vendors and helping in reduction of  telecom imports. Its innovations support the deployment of secure, scalable networks tailored to India's needs.\n\nQuantum communication systems: Recognising the rising importance of cybersecurity, C-DOT has developed quantum encryption solutions, ensuring secure communication for government and strategic sectors.\n\nDisaster management solutions: Technologies like geo-targeted and automated multihazard,  multi-media  early  warning  alerts  to  citizens  have  reinforced  India's  resilience against natural disasters.\n\nCybersecurity  and  resilience: As  telecom  infrastructure  evolves,  so  do  the  threats. C-DOT  has  developed  indigenous  cybersecurity  tools  that  monitor  and  protect  critical infrastructure. These tools are pivotal in mitigating risks associated with cyber warfare and ensuring national security. C-DoT has developed the SAMVAD app to provide secure call and chat for sharing text, image, audio, and video files and deployed in strategic organizations.\n\nUplifting  domestic  telecom  ecosystem: Through  its  CCRP  (C-DOT  Collaborative Research  Program),  C-DOT  fosters  indigenous  telecom  innovation  by  partnering  with industry  players.  This  initiative  strengthens  India's  telecom  research  ecosystem,  with C-DOT offering funding and expertise to help companies develop advanced technologies. C-DOT also supports startups incubated under the CCRP framework. The national initiative for developing and harnessing innovations (NIDHI) and Avishkar programme have been launched by the government to nurture innovations and ideas into startups.\n\nC-DOT's journey can exemplify India's transition from a telecom consumer to a technology innovator, propelling the nation towards a future of digital sovereignty and inclusive connectivity.\n\n## Box VIII.5: Open Network for Digital Commerce: thinking beyond platforms\n\nThe  pandemic  underscored  the  critical  role  of  digital  commerce  in  enabling  business continuity  and  consumer  access  to  essentials.  Digital  commerce  played  role  in  enabling resilience  in  the  economy.  The  prevailing  platform-centric  model  of  digital  commerce globally,  and  increasingly  in  India,  calls  for  attention.  A  few  large  e-commerce  players dominate the market, which affects participation and flexibility of smaller sellers, such as local retailers, artisans, and MSMEs. Sellers often have to conform to terms and conditions, from customer data access to product visibility, reducing their market leverage and fostering dependence on these platforms.\n\nThe Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) represents a paradigm shift, promoting a democratic and interoperable digital commerce ecosystem thus fostering inclusivity and equity. ONDC enables buyers and sellers to transact seamlessly across different platforms. It  helps  by  reducing  customer  acquisition  costs,  enhancing  business  efficiencies,  and expanding choices for merchants and consumers.\n\nONDC recorded more than 14 million transactions in the month of November 2024 across 1100+ cities. 7 lakh+ sellers and service providers are active on the ONDC network spread across 600+ cities and towns across India. 190+ network participants are live on the network. Presently, over 7000 farmer producer organisations (FPOs) have registered to be a part of the ONDC network through various seller network participants. Around 400 self-help groups (SHGs), micro-entrepreneurs, and social sector enterprises have been onboarded on the network. Mobility through the ONDC network is live in 15+ cities with around 5.45 lakh taxi and auto drivers onboarded.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Scaling new frontiers: thinking beyond traditional e-commerce\n\nLogistics as a service: ONDC is integrating  hyperlocal  and  inter-city  logistics  service providers to ensure a seamless supply chain with unified first-mile, middle mile, and lastmile connectivity across 1200+ cities.\n\nFinancial services: ONDC's financial services category was launched in August 2024. It  integrated  with  9  lending  service  providers  applications  and  3  lenders,  to  enhance accessibility  and  efficiency  in  credit  services.  It  integrates  account  aggregator  for  data, digilocker / Aadhaar for KYC, eNACH / eMandate for repayment and Aadhaar eSign for agreement signing. It facilitates low-cost distribution and innovation in financial products, enabling personal loans, health insurance, and mutual funds.\n\n## Expanding coverage: enhancing inclusion\n\nThe platform today has 10 active domains, 110 network participants, and close to 6.5 lakh sellers/service  providers.  It  has  attracted  an  increasing  number  of  transactions  since  its launch. In the retail category, the platform has seen over 4.4 crore orders transacted, across 814 districts and with 2.83 lakh sellers involved. 17\n\nONDC in collaboration  with  Bhashini,  an  AI-driven  language  translation  tool,  launched Saarthi, a reference application to assist businesses in creating their buyer-side apps. In October  2024 18 ,  the  platform  joined  hands  with  the  National  Cooperative  Consumers' Federation of India, and Otipy to make onions available at affordable prices across the NCR region, in order to help reduce the prices.\n\n17 https://opendata.ondc.org/",
