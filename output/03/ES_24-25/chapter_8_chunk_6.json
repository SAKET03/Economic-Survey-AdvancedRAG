  "content": "Chapter 8 Summary:\nThe service sector has been a significant contributor to India's GDP growth, particularly in FY25, where it propped up growth when manufacturing was affected by global merchandise trade dampening. Services exports play a critical role in strengthening India's external balance, and the 'servicification' of the industrial sector adds to its importance. Logistics services have regained pre-pandemic momentum, enhancing user experience through digitization. India continues to be an important partner in the global technology landscape through the adoption of digital technologies in business processes. Initiatives like Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) are making these transformations more inclusive. Equipping the labor force with requisite skills and creating an enabling environment through simple and transparent processes of grassroots-level governance will help realize the full potential of commercial services and build resilience to global headwinds. India's services sector has been the steadiest contributor to the gross value added (GVA) in the economy, with a contribution of about 55% to the total GVA at current prices in FY25. It provides employment to approximately 30% of the workforce. The growth in the service sector, as measured by the year-over-year change in real GVA by services, has been above 6% in each year in the last decade, except for the Covid-19 pandemic that affected FY21. The average services growth rate before the pandemic was 8%, and the average services growth in the post-pandemic year, i.e., FY23 to FY25, has risen to 8.3%. Within the service sector, public administration services have accounted for a share in the range of 11-12% of the total services GVA during FY13 to FY23. Information and computer-related services had the maximum buoyancy among the services during the last decade (FY13 to FY23), growing at a trend rate of 12.8% and stepping up its share in overall GVA from 6.3% in FY13 to 10.9% in FY23. The Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) - services shows that the service sector remained in the expansionary zone for 41 consecutive months since August 2021. The HSBC's India services PMI shows that the service sector remained in the expansionary zone for continuous 41 months since August 2021. The index remained above the 60 mark for the first five months of FY25. However, in September, the index witnessed a ten-month low, but it quickly rebounded in October. The recent data indicates demand buoyancy continued to drive new business inflows higher, which in turn supported output growth and prompted firms to recruit additional workers. Finance & insurance registered the strongest increases in both new orders and business activity at the sub-sector level. The export of services grew at a trend rate of 11% during FY14 to FY23, at constant prices. Computer services and business services exports account for around 70% of India's services exports. India remained amongst the top five major countries in terms of growth in services exports in FY25 (April-September). India's services export growth accelerated to 12.8% in April-November FY25 from 5.7% in FY24. In April-November FY25, services imports grew by 13.9%, in contrast to a decline of 2.9% during the same period in FY24. Total outstanding bank credit to the services sector stands at 48.5 lakh crore as of November 2024. The year-over-year growth in credit to the services sector was recorded at 13%. Within the service sector, computer software and professional services recorded the highest year-over-year credit growth at 22.5% and 19.4%, respectively. FDI equity inflows stood at USD 29.8 billion in FY25 (April-September), while the services sector witnessed USD 5.7 billion inflow in the same period. In FY25 (April-September), insurance services received the highest FDI inflows of over 62%, followed by the financial sector, which received over 18% of the total FDI equity inflows to the services sector. Indian Railways (IR) is the fourth largest network in the world. Passenger traffic originating in IR achieved a growth of 8% over the previous year. Revenue-earning freight in FY24 achieved a growth of 5.2%. The government is taking various steps to upgrade passenger amenities. Out of a total of 7,325 railway stations across the nation, train indication boards have been provided at 1351 stations, coach guidance systems at 866 stations, digital clocks at 5605 stations, and public address systems at 6071 stations as of November 2024. Wi-Fi facility has been provided at 6112 stations to date. A new policy for the management of mobile catering services was introduced in 2023. As of date, 557 base kitchens have been commissioned catering to 468 pairs of trains. As a result of the push toward digitalization in IR, E-ticketing has touched 86% in the reserved sector as of October 2024. Ticketing through digital means in the unreserved sector has increased from 28% at the beginning of the current financial year to around 33% in October 2024. IR has also transformed the refund process enabling refunds in eligible cases within 24 hours in around 98% of cases. Dynamic QR code-based payment has been enabled across all the counters. The passenger reservation system is being redeveloped using cloud-native technologies. The new application will have features like high scalability, high performance, high availability, high level of security, ease of operations, and high agility. To encourage tourism, Bharat Gaurav trains have been introduced as theme-based tourist circuit trains that showcase India's rich cultural heritage and magnificent historical places. Under this scheme, the service provider is to provide comprehensive tour services comprising meals, accommodation, transport, sightseeing, tour guide, etc. As of date, a total of 325 trips of Bharat Gaurav trains carrying 1,91,033 tourists have been operated covering various tourist destinations. India's real estate market witnessed robust performance under office demand as well as residential sales driven by economic stability and positive market sentiment. After the enactment of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority, India ranked 31st out of 89 countries in the Global Real Estate Transparency Index in 2024. The demand for real estate is emerging not only in tier 1 and tier 2 cities but across the country due to the expansion of metro networks, enhancement to road networks, and improvements in connectivity. Housing demand in India is expected to touch 93 million units by 2036. The rise of real estate investment trusts (REITs) further amplifies the positive trajectory of the commercial sector. The residential real estate market scaled an 11-year high in sales volume in the first six months of 2024. During this period, total sale across top eight cities recorded 11% year-over-year growth. The Indian IT/ITeS industry has a leading position globally and has been a significant contributor to the growth of exports. According to NASSCOM Strategic Review Report 2024, India's tech industry demonstrated extraordinary resilience in FY24, amidst macroeconomic pressures and geopolitical tensions. The industry has estimated revenues of USD 254 billion, marking a 3.8% year-over-year growth in FY24 (excluding e-commerce). Tech exports reached nearly USD 200 billion, reflecting a growth of 3.3%, while the domestic market is expected to expand by 5.9%, crossing USD 54 billion in FY24. The sector maintained its position as a net hirer, adding 60,000 employees to reach a workforce of 5.43 million in FY24. The abolition of the angel tax (on investments made by investors in startups) is expected to boost the country's global innovation and entrepreneurial competitiveness. Expanding the scope of safe harbour rules and streamlining transfer pricing assessment procedures are expected to make the country's transfer pricing regime more attractive and competitive, boost IT exports, and ease business for Global Capability Centres and the IT services industry. Other reforms include the abolition of the 2% equalisation levy, reduction in tax deduction at source on payment made by e-commerce operators to e-commerce participants, relief from GST on data centre exports, reduction of rate of tax collection at source to be collected by e-commerce operators, etc. India's Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are emerging as strategic hubs reshaping the Indian corporate landscape while influencing global business dynamics. The number of GCCs in India has grown from approximately 1430 in FY19 to over 1700 in FY24. As of FY24, GCCs in India employ nearly 1.9 million professionals. Over the past five years, India has remained at the forefront of the global GCC expansion strategy, with more than 400 new GCCs and around 1100 new units established. GCCs are fundamentally altering the technology landscape. Leading organisations are centralising their tech ecosystems in India. This is particularly evident in sectors like aerospace, defence, and semiconductors, where companies are advancing their engineering efforts to focus on next-generation platforms, products, and technologies. Over the last five years, the setup rate of engineering research & development GCCs has grown 1.3 times faster than the overall GCC setup, highlighting a continued shift towards high-value-added work. India has established itself as a prominent player in leveraging its vast talent pool, which accounts for 28% of the global (science, technology, engineering, mathematics) STEM workforce and 23% of the global software engineering talent. Over the past decade, the GCC ecosystem in India has matured significantly, advancing into high-end engineering roles such as product managers and architects, with 35% of transformation hubs exhibiting a strong presence of architects. Furthermore, global roles within GCCs are expanding rapidly, expected to grow from currently 6,500 to over 30,000 by 2030, supported by robust training programs to develop leadership. The adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) and the establishment of AI centres of excellence further enhance the GCC landscape by tapping into India's strong middle-management talent. The services sector, including banking, financial services, and insurance (BFSI), healthcare, telecom, retail, and transport and logistics, stands out for its rapid AI adoption, supported by various national initiatives and technologies. India's telecom sector is expanding with the smartphone boom, surging data consumption, and the advent of technologies like 5G. India stands as the second-largest telecommunications market, with over 1.18 billion telephone subscribers, an overall teledensity of 84%, and 941 million broadband users as of 31st October 2024. The country also leads in mobile data consumption per subscriber and offers the world's most affordable data rates. India's achievement of the fastest 5G rollout globally highlights its technological prowess in the telecom sector. There has been a paradigm shift in India's telecom technology space that underscores an ongoing effective transition from a technology importer to a technology developer and exporter. The Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT) has been committed to research and development of indigenous solutions and reducing dependency on foreign technologies. C-DOT has consistently spearheaded next-generation telecom technologies: 4G and 5G core networks, quantum communication systems, disaster management solutions, and cybersecurity and resilience. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) represents a paradigm shift, promoting a democratic and interoperable digital commerce ecosystem thus fostering inclusivity and equity. ONDC enables buyers and sellers to transact seamlessly across different platforms. It helps by reducing customer acquisition costs, enhancing business efficiencies, and expanding choices for merchants and consumers. ONDC recorded more than 14 million transactions in the month of November 2024 across 1100+ cities. 7 lakh+ sellers and service providers are active on the ONDC network spread across 600+ cities and towns across India. 190+ network participants are live on the network. Presently, over 7000 farmer producer organisations (FPOs) have registered to be a part of the ONDC network through various seller network participants. Around 400 self-help groups (SHGs), micro-entrepreneurs, and social sector enterprises have been onboarded on the network. Mobility through the ONDC network is live in 15+ cities with around 5.45 lakh taxi and auto drivers onboarded. The platform today has 10 active domains, 110 network participants, and close to 6.5 lakh sellers/service providers. It has attracted an increasing number of transactions since its launch. The service sector accounts for about 55% of the national GVA in FY25. However, the distribution of service sector activity across Indian states reveals a pronounced geographic dispersion. For FY23, Karnataka and Maharashtra account for more than one-fourth of the total service sector GSVA of all the states. These states along with Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat together share more than 50% of the total service sector GSVA. These states also have more than 50% of the total industrial GSVA, suggesting that both feed into each other. On the other hand, another set of 19 states collectively account for only one-fourth of the service sector GSVA of all the states. Among the different service activities, public administration is a unique category that reflects the strength of the state machinery in the state. This is majorly determined by the strength of state's own revenues, central transfers including tax devolution and borrowing of the state, which together define the spending capacity of the state. This is independent of other services which are largely commercially driven. The economies of many north eastern states have considerable dependence on the resources of the state and central government because there are natural disadvantages to those regions to pursue large-scale industrialisation and commercial services. There are four different scenarios in the relationship between services share in total GSVA (defined as service intensity of the state economy), and, services GSVA per capita. Category (ii) above indicates that the productivity of commercial services is high. In contrast, category (iii) represents high dependence on commercial service activities without their being productive enough to generate high levels of income. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn from states falling in the other two categories without analysing supplementary information. However, in category (iv), some state patterns are very clear-Karnataka's, and to an extent, Telangana's positions are majorly explained by the large presence of IT services, Maharashtra's position is largely due to its strength of financial intermediation activities, and, Kerala's position mainly because of the strong presence of trade, financial and real estate services. The states like Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, and Mizoram have more than a third of their services GSVA coming from trade, repair, hotels, and restaurants, partly because of tourism. Many bigger states have trade and repair intensity of close to or higher than the national average indicating a large presence of low-value adding trade in these states. Many of these states are relatively less industrialised also. Financial, real estate and professional services have very high levels of concentration in a few states. Within the service sector, financial services are highly concentrated with Maharashtra (Mumbai), Tamil Nadu, Gujarat (GIFT City) and Karnataka accounting for more than 50% of total financial services GSVA. Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Haryana, Tamil Nadu have more than one-third of their services GSVA coming from real estate, ownership of dwelling & professional services. Karnataka (Bengaluru), Telangana (Hyderabad) and Maharashtra (Mumbai), Haryana (Gurugram) and Tamil Nadu (Chennai) have concentration of IT and fintech services leading to high demand for office and residential space. On the basis of the above analysis, states can be classified into four distinct categories based on their service and industrial performance in terms of per capita GSVA. States with high per capita industrial GSVA: These are states like Gujarat, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh. States like Chhattisgarh and Odisha perform reasonably well in the industrial sector while they have low service sector presence. This indicates that these states will stand to gain largely by accelerating their industrialisation and industrial productivity which will strengthen their service sectors through the ongoing trends in greater 'servicification' of industries. Strong service sector performers: States such as Karnataka, Telangana and Kerala excel in services, with high per-capita service GSVA and service shares in GSVA but exhibit only around average industrial per capita GSVA. These regions largely depend on urbanised service-driven economies. Dual strengths-industrial and service: Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu typically represent states with reasonably strong industrial and service sectors. Their diversified economies integrate manufacturing with trade, financial services, real estate & professional services. States with reform potential: While the need for business reforms cuts across states in general, the fourth category specifically includes states that have significant potential for reform-led development. These states are Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. As per DPIIT's Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP), which ranks states based on their performance in introducing business reforms, the states with service intensity backed by industry are the states which have introduced larger numbers of reforms in comparison to their peer states and fall in top achiever and achiever's category. Thus, introducing business reforms is essential to industrial as well as service development in the state. As per annual survey of unincorporated sector enterprises 2022-23, the number of estimated enterprises belonging to the unincorporated sector stands at 6.5 crore. 72.6% of these enterprises operate in the service sector. Many states like Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have a substantial presence of these enterprises. These enterprises, though contributing to the overall development of the economy in terms of employment and income, are losing out on benefits normally offered by incorporation such as tax benefits, and credibility which could help them build better client relationships, access to credit and durability which would help them provide continuity to their business operations etc. States, through policy nudges reducing compliance difficulties, can accelerate the incorporation of these enterprises.\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Sources of Financing: Bank Credit and FDI\n\nSOURCES OF FINANCING: BANK CREDIT AND FDI\n\n8.10 Total outstanding bank credit 7  to services sector stands at 48.5 lakh crore as of November 2024.

Passenger traffic originating  in  IR  achieved  a  growth  of  8  per  cent  over  the  previous  year.  Revenueearning freight in FY24, achieved a growth of 5.2 per cent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n8.13  In view of the rising passenger traffic, the government is taking various steps to upgrade passenger amenities. Out of a total of 7,325 railway stations across the nation, train indication boards have been provided at 1351 stations, coach guidance systems at 866 stations, digital clocks at 5605 stations, and public address systems at 6071 stations as of November 2024. Wi-Fi facility has been provided at 6112 stations to date. A new policy for the management of mobile catering services was introduced in 2023. As of date, 557 base kitchens have been commissioned catering to 468 pairs of trains.\n\n8.14  As a result of the push toward digitalization in IR, E-ticketing has touched 86 per cent in the reserved sector as of October 2024. Ticketing through digital means in the unreserved sector has increased from 28 per cent at the beginning of the current financial  year  to  around  33  per  cent  in  October  2024.  IR  has  also  transformed  the refund process enabling refunds in eligible cases within 24 hours in around 98 per cent of cases. Dynamic QR code-based payment has been enabled across all the counters. The passenger reservation system is being redeveloped using cloud-native technologies.\n\nThe new application will have features like high scalability, high performance, high availability, high level of security, ease of operations, and high agility.\n\n8.15   To  encourage  tourism,  Bharat  gaurav  trains  have  been  introduced  as  themebased tourist circuit trains that showcase India's rich cultural heritage and magnificent historical places. Under this scheme, the service provider is to provide comprehensive tour  services  comprising  meals,  accommodation,  transport,  sightseeing,  tour  guide, etc. As of date, a total of 325 trips of Bharat gaurav trains carrying 1,91,033 tourists have been operated covering various tourist destinations.\n\n## Road transport\n\n8.16   Road  transport  generates  the  highest  GVA  within  transport  services.  During FY23, road transport accounted for 78 per cent of the total GVA of transport services. Enhancing user  convenience  on  national  highways  is  central  to  the  growth  of  road transport.  In this direction, the government has moved from traditional ways of tolling to  digitised  tolling  by  adopting  electronic  toll  collection  through  FASTag.  This  has reduced the average waiting time at toll plazas from 734 seconds to 47 seconds 10 . The government has targeted the rollout of barrier-free tolling on all four lane plus NHs and high-speed corridors by FY29. The government has planned to establish more than one thousand wayside amenities in the next five years to provide world-class facilities and amenities to highway users in line with global standards along the NHs at every 40-60 kms on both sides.\n\n8.17   In  a  major  step  towards  road  safety,  the  government  has  formulated  a comprehensive strategy to improve road safety standards on NHs. A cashless treatment scheme for road accident victims has been initiated. Institute of driving training and research, regional driving training centres, and driving training centres at the state/ district level have been set up. The government is also working towards road safety through  initiatives  like  supporting  truck  driver  health  with  the  Abhay  project,  and providing eye tests and health checks for drivers.\n\n## Aviation: flying high\n\n8.18   India  is  the  fastest-growing  aviation  market  globally.  To  accommodate  the substantial growth in air traffic, Indian airlines have placed amongst the largest orders for aircraft globally.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.19   In  the  sphere  of  the  maintenance,  repair,  and  overhaul  (MRO)  industry,  the government is encouraging original equipment manufacturers to establish facilities in India and has introduced policies to align the sector with global standards.\n\n## Box VIII.2: New segments - drones, leasing and MRO\n\n- As of October 31, 2024, India has seen a notable rise in drone activities, with 140 remote pilot  training  organisations,  18,862  remote  pilot  certificates  issued,  26,659  registered drones, and 82 approved drone models (DGCA type certificates). About ₹ 60.6 crore have been disbursed under the PLI scheme to support drone manufacturing.\n- As  of  November  30,  2024,  32  aircraft  leasing  entities  (including  provisional)  have registered  in  the  GIFT-IFSC,  leasing  105  aviation  assets,  including  53  aircraft  and  52 engines.\n- On July  12,  2024,  the  government  announced  a  uniform  5  per  cent  integrated  goods and  services  tax  on  imported  aircraft  parts  and  tools,  applicable  regardless  of  HSN classification.\n\n8.20 The PM Gati Shakti initiative aims to create a seamless multimodal connectivity network across the country. Under this initiative, the aviation sector is being integrated with other modes of transport, such as railways, roads, and waterways.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n## Port, Waterways and Shipping: Sea of opportunities\n\n8.21  Major ports of India are enhancing their capacity to accommodate increased trade demand. The cargo movement in FY24 was 819 MT. In FY25, in line with the annual target of 870 MT, around 622 MT has been handled upto December 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n8.22   The  government  of  India  has  launched  the  Maritime  India  Vision  2030  and Maritime Amritkaal Vision 2047 with the aim of positioning Indian shipbuilding and ship repair among the top five globally by 2047.\n\n8.23     Inland  water  transport  holds  great  untapped  potential  as  a  means  for  the transport of goods and passengers. India has a large endowment of rivers, canals, and other waterways. The total navigable length of waterways in India is around 14,850 km. As of October 2024, the country has 26 operational waterways of more than 4,800 km. The government is also putting efforts into promoting river cruise tourism on national\n\nwaterways. Passenger movement on national waterways in Q2 of FY25 was more than 3.36 crore, increasing from approximately 67 lakh passengers in Q2 of FY24.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## OTHER SERVICES\n\n## Tourism and hospitality\n\n8.24  The tourism sector's contribution to GDP regained the pre-pandemic level of 5 per cent in FY23. The tourism sector created 7.6 crore jobs in FY23.\n\n8.25  International tourist arrivals (ITAs) in India have rebounded to pre-pandemic level in 2023. The share of India's ITAs in World ITAs stands at 1.45 per cent in 2023. Foreign exchange earnings through tourism were 28 billion USD. India received 1.8 per cent of world tourism receipts and attained a rank of 14th worldwide in world tourism receipts during 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Real Estate: Building the economy\n\n8.26  India's real estate market witnessed robust performance under office demand as well as residential sales driven by economic stability and positive market sentiment. After the enactment of the Real Estate Regulatory Authority, India ranked 31st out of 89 countries in the Global Real Estate Transparency Index in 2024 11 . The demand for real estate is emerging not only in tier 1 and tier 2 cities but across the country due to the expansion of metro networks, enhancement to road networks, and improvements in  connectivity.  Housing  demand  in  India  is  expected  to  touch  93  million  units  by 2036 12 . The rise of real estate investment trusts (REITs) further amplifies the positive trajectory of the commercial sector.  The residential real estate market scaled an 11-year high in sales volume in the first six months of 2024. During this period, total sale across top eight cities recorded 11 per cent YoY growth 13 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.27   The  Real  Estate  (Regulation  and  Development)  Act  has  brought  numerous improvements in the real estate sector, including protection against fraud, increased transparency,  timely  project  deliveries,  and  measures  to  prevent  misuse  of  funds, among other benefits. GST has helped to simplify the taxation structure in real estate transactions by applying a single unified tax system across states. It has encouraged proper  invoicing  and  documentation,  thus  reducing  the  scope  for  tax  evasion.  The government  introduced  REITs  as  an  investment  vehicle  in  commercial  real  estate, allowing investors to pool funds and invest in income-generating real estate. This helps increase commercial real estate market liquidity and attracts institutional investors. Implementation of online platforms for the submission and approval of building plans has led to a reduction in delays and brought more transparency to the process.
