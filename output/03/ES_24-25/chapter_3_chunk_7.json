Total exports, including merchandise and services, reached USD602.6 billion, growing 6% in the first nine months. Services and goods exports, excluding petroleum and gems and jewelry, grew 10.4%. Total imports were USD682.2 billion, growing 6.9%, driven by steady domestic demand.\\n\\nThe global trade dynamics are shifting towards greater protectionism, requiring India to assess the situation and develop a forward-looking strategic trade roadmap. India can accelerate growth and enhance its presence in global trade by adapting to these trends and leveraging its strengths. To strengthen competitiveness, India should focus on reducing trade-related costs and enhancing export facilitation.\\n\\nForeign portfolio investments (FPIs) showed a mixed trend in FY25, with uncertainty in global markets and profit-taking by foreign portfolio investors leading to capital outflows. However, strong macroeconomic fundamentals, a favorable business environment, and high economic growth kept FPI flows positive overall. Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows showed signs of revival, growing 17.9% to USD55.6 billion in the first eight months of FY25.\\n\\nIndia's foreign exchange reserves stood at USD640.3 billion as of December 2024, sufficient to cover approximately 90% of the country's external debt of USD711.8 billion. The reserves reflect a strong buffer against external vulnerabilities.\\n\\nThe chapter also discusses the impact of global trade dynamics, tariffs, and non-tariff measures on India's trade performance. The Global Trade Alert database reported over 26,000 new restrictions related to trade and investments globally between 2020 and 2024. Technical barriers to trade (TBT) affect 31.6% of product lines, covering 67.1% of global trade.\\n\\nThe European Union's (EU) Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) and European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) are expected to impact India's exports. The CBAM aims to align the cost of carbon emissions for imported goods with that of domestically produced products, and the EUDR regulates the consumption of products derived from deforested land.\\n\\nIndia's trade performance was robust in FY25, with total exports growing 6% to USD602.6 billion. Merchandise exports registered modest growth of 1.6%, while services exports grew 11.6%. Textile exports increased 7.6%, driven by a 9.1% growth in non-petroleum and non-gems and jewelry exports.\\n\\nThe government's initiatives, such as the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM), and Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM-MITRA) parks, aim to promote the textile sector. India is also actively negotiating trade deals with top importers, such as the EU and the UK.\\n\\nIndia's e-commerce exports are expected to grow significantly, driven by expanding data connectivity, increased penetration of smartphones, and a rise in digital wallets and safer online payments. The government has introduced initiatives to foster cross-border digital trade and promote e-commerce, including the Niryat Bandhu scheme and financial assistance to e-commerce exporters.\\n\\nThe Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) policy uncertainty index for India captures policy uncertainty from domestic and international events. The index uses internet search data from Google Trends to assess policy uncertainty.\\n\\nIndia's Balance of Payments (BoP) position remained stable, led by resilient services exports, benign crude oil prices, renewed foreign portfolio inflows, and a revival in FDI flows. The current account deficit (CAD) moderated to 1.2% of GDP in Q2 of FY25.\\n\\nPrivate transfers, mainly driven by remittances, grew steadily to USD31.9 billion in Q2 of FY25. The capital and financial account surplus was USD30.5 billion in Q2 of FY25, driven by robust inflows from FDI, FPI, and external loans.\\n\\nFDI inflows into India have surpassed the USD1 trillion mark from April 2000 to September 2024. The services sector remains the largest recipient of FDI, accounting for 19.1% of total equity inflows in H1 of FY25.\\n\\nThe growth trajectory of capital inflows has shown signs of revival in recent quarters. Net capital inflows stood at USD30.5 billion in Q2 of FY25, a significant increase from the USD12.8 billion recorded during the same period in the previous year.\\n\\nForeign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) became net buyers in the Indian equity market in June 2024, injecting substantial capital into the market. However, this trend reversed in October and November 2024, resulting in a net outflow.\\n\\nThe inclusion of Indian Government Bonds (IGB) in global bond indices has significantly supported debt inflows. India's foreign exchange reserves moderated to USD640.3 billion as of December 2024, sufficient to cover approximately 90% of India's external debt.\\n\\nThe import cover stood at 10.9 months as of December 2024, enhancing India's ability to weather external shocks. The BoP surplus and valuation gain drove the improvement in forex reserves.\\n\\nThe value of the Indian Rupee (INR) is market-determined, with no target or specific level or band. The INR depreciated modestly by 2.9% in the first nine months of FY25.\\n\\nIndia's external debt has remained stable, with an external debt to GDP ratio of 19.4% at the end of September 2024. The share of short-term debt in total external debt decreased to 18.8% at the end of September 2024.\\n\\nIndia's external sector is expected to perform well amidst unfavorable geopolitical conditions. The industry must continue to invest in quality, and both the state and private sector must focus on quality and efficiency to increase India's share in overseas markets and generate resources to sustain a higher level of capital formation.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Outlook\n\n## OUTLOOK\n\n3.69   India's  external  sector  has  performed  well  amidst  unfavourable  geopolitical conditions. On the current account front, though merchandise exports have displayed moderate  growth  owing  to  a  slowdown  in  external  demand,  merchandise  imports have shown remarkable growth supported by strong domestic demand. Increased net services receipts and growing remittances have cushioned the rise in the merchandise trade deficit. On the capital front, the economy has been witnessing net positive capital inflows. Gross FDI inflows have shown a higher growth in the first eight months of FY25 compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. However, a surge in repatriation has reined in the expansion in net FDI. FPI inflows have shown volatility in the first nine months of FY25, showing mixed trends.\n\n3.70  Global trade dynamics have changed significantly in recent years, shifting from globalisation to rising trade protectionism, accompanied by increased uncertainty. This calls for a new strategic trade roadmap for India. To remain competitive and enhance its participation in global supply chains, India must continue reducing trade costs and improving facilitation to boost export competitiveness. Much remains to be done to enhance trade competitiveness. The good news is that doing so is entirely in our hands. On its part, the industry must continue to invest in quality.\n\n3.71   The state produces governance, and the private sector produces goods and services. If both these actors focus on quality and efficiency, then despite the trade tensions and protectionism that are likely to come in the way of expanding global trade, India can increase its share in overseas markets and generate resources to sustain a higher level of capital formation. Then, it will be possible for us not just to dream of but actually realise higher economic growth rates on a sustained basis.",
