  "content": "Chapter 8 Summary:\nThe service sector has been a significant contributor to India's GDP growth, particularly in FY25, where it propped up growth when manufacturing was affected by global merchandise trade dampening. Services exports play a critical role in strengthening India's external balance, and the 'servicification' of the industrial sector adds to its importance. Logistics services have regained pre-pandemic momentum, enhancing user experience through digitization. India continues to be an important partner in the global technology landscape through the adoption of digital technologies in business processes. Initiatives like Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) are making these transformations more inclusive. Equipping the labor force with requisite skills and creating an enabling environment through simple and transparent processes of grassroots-level governance will help realize the full potential of commercial services and build resilience to global headwinds. The service sector's value-added accounts for about 62% of global GDP, and services have been the growth engine for middle-income countries like China, Thailand, and India in the last decade. India's services sector has been the steadiest contributor to GVA, with its contribution to total GVA at current prices increasing from 50.6% in FY14 to about 55% in FY25. It provides employment to approximately 30% of the workforce. The growth in the service sector, as measured by YoY change in real GVA by services, has been above 6% in each year in the last decade, except for the Covid-19 pandemic-affected FY21. The average services growth rate before the pandemic was 8%, and the average services growth in the post-pandemic year, i.e., FY23 to FY25, has risen to 8.3%. Public administration services have accounted for a share in the range of 11-12% of the total services GVA during FY13 to FY23. Information and computer-related services had the maximum buoyancy among the services during the last decade, growing at a trend rate of 12.8% during FY13 to FY23. The Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) - services shows that the service sector remained in the expansionary zone for 41 consecutive months since August 2021. The export of services grew at a trend rate of 11% during FY14 to FY23, at constant prices. Computer services and business services exports account for around 70% of India's services exports. India's services export growth accelerated to 12.8% in April-November FY25 from 5.7% in FY24. In April-November FY25, services imports grew by 13.9%, in contrast to a decline of 2.9% during the same period in FY24. Total outstanding bank credit to the services sector stands at Rs. 48.5 lakh crore as of November 2024. The YoY growth in credit to the services sector was recorded at 13%. Within the service sector, computer software and professional services recorded the highest YoY credit growth at 22.5% and 19.4%, respectively. FDI equity inflows stood at USD 29.8 billion in FY25 (April-September), while the services sector witnessed USD 5.7 billion inflow in the same period. The Indian Railways' passenger traffic achieved a growth of 8% over the previous year, and revenue-earning freight in FY24 achieved a growth of 5.2%. The government is taking steps to upgrade passenger amenities, including providing train indication boards, coach guidance systems, digital clocks, and public address systems at various stations. Wi-Fi facilities have been provided at 6112 stations to date. A new policy for the management of mobile catering services was introduced in 2023. E-ticketing has touched 86% in the reserved sector as of October 2024. The passenger reservation system is being redeveloped using cloud-native technologies. Bharat Gaurav trains have been introduced as theme-based tourist circuit trains showcasing India's rich cultural heritage and historical places. Under this scheme, 325 trips of Bharat Gaurav trains carrying 1,91,033 tourists have been operated, covering various tourist destinations. The tourism sector's contribution to GDP regained the pre-pandemic level of 5% in FY23. The tourism sector created 7.6 crore jobs in FY23. International tourist arrivals in India have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in 2023. The share of India's international tourist arrivals in world ITAs stands at 1.45% in 2023. Foreign exchange earnings through tourism were USD 28 billion. India received 1.8% of world tourism receipts and attained a rank of 14th worldwide in world tourism receipts during 2023. India's real estate market witnessed robust performance under office demand and residential sales driven by economic stability and positive market sentiment. The demand for real estate is emerging not only in tier 1 and tier 2 cities but across the country due to the expansion of metro networks, enhancement to road networks, and improvements in connectivity. Housing demand in India is expected to touch 93 million units by 2036. The rise of real estate investment trusts (REITs) further amplifies the positive trajectory of the commercial sector. The residential real estate market scaled an 11-year high in sales volume in the first six months of 2024. The Indian IT/ITeS industry has a leading position globally and has been a significant contributor to the growth of exports. The industry has estimated revenues of USD 254 billion, marking a 3.8% YoY growth in FY24. Tech exports reached nearly USD 200 billion, reflecting a growth of 3.3%, while the domestic market is expected to expand by 5.9%, crossing USD 54 billion in FY24. The sector maintained its position as a net hirer, adding 60,000 employees to reach a workforce of 5.43 million in FY24. The abolition of the angel tax is expected to boost the country's global innovation and entrepreneurial competitiveness. Expanding the scope of safe harbor rules and streamlining transfer pricing assessment procedures are expected to make the country's transfer pricing regime more attractive and competitive. India's telecom sector is expanding with the smartphone boom, surging data consumption, and the advent of technologies like 5G. India stands as the second-largest telecommunications market, with over 1.18 billion telephone subscribers, an overall teledensity of 84%, and 941 million broadband users as of October 31, 2024. The country also leads in mobile data consumption per subscriber and offers the world's most affordable data rates. India's achievement of the fastest 5G rollout globally highlights its technological prowess in the telecom sector. The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) represents a paradigm shift, promoting a democratic and interoperable digital commerce ecosystem, thus fostering inclusivity and equity. ONDC enables buyers and sellers to transact seamlessly across different platforms. It helps by reducing customer acquisition costs, enhancing business efficiencies, and expanding choices for merchants and consumers. ONDC recorded more than 14 million transactions in November 2024 across 1100+ cities. Over 7 lakh sellers and service providers are active on the ONDC network spread across 600+ cities and towns across India. 190+ network participants are live on the network. Presently, over 7000 farmer producer organizations (FPOs) have registered to be a part of the ONDC network through various seller network participants. Around 400 self-help groups (SHGs), micro-entrepreneurs, and social sector enterprises have been onboarded on the network. Mobility through the ONDC network is live in 15+ cities with around 5.45 lakh taxi and auto drivers onboarded. The platform today has 10 active domains, 110 network participants, and close to 6.5 lakh sellers/service providers. It has attracted an increasing number of transactions since its launch. The service sector accounts for about 55% of the national GVA in FY25. However, the distribution of service sector activity across Indian states reveals a pronounced geographic dispersion. For FY23, Karnataka and Maharashtra account for more than one-fourth of the total service sector GSVA of all the states. These states along with Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat together share more than 50% of the total service sector GSVA. These states also have more than 50% of the total industrial GSVA, suggesting that both feed into each other. On the other hand, another set of 19 states collectively account for only one-fourth of the service sector GSVA of all the states. Public administration is a unique category that reflects the strength of the state machinery in the state. This is majorly determined by the strength of the state's own revenues, central transfers including tax devolution and borrowing of the state, which together define the spending capacity of the state. This is independent of other services which are largely commercially driven. There are four different scenarios in the relationship between services share in total GSVA and services GSVA per capita. States like Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, and Mizoram have more than a third of their services GSVA coming from trade, repair, hotels, and restaurants, partly because of tourism. Many bigger states have trade and repair intensity of close to or higher than the national average indicating a large presence of low-value-adding trade in these states. Many of these states are relatively less industrialized also. Financial, real estate, and professional services have very high levels of concentration in a few states. Within the service sector, financial services are highly concentrated with Maharashtra (Mumbai), Tamil Nadu, Gujarat (GIFT City), and Karnataka accounting for more than 50% of total financial services GSVA. Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Haryana, Tamil Nadu have more than one-third of their services GSVA coming from real estate, ownership of dwelling & professional services. The states like Karnataka, Telangana, and Kerala excel in services, with high per-capita service GSVA and service shares in GSVA but exhibit only around average industrial per capita GSVA. Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu typically represent states with reasonably strong industrial and service sectors. Their diversified economies integrate manufacturing with trade, financial services, real estate & professional services. States with reform potential include Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. As per DPIIT's Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP), which ranks states based on their performance in introducing business reforms, the states with service intensity backed by industry are the states which have introduced larger numbers of reforms in comparison to their peer states and fall in top achiever and achiever's category. Thus, introducing business reforms is essential to industrial as well as service development in the state. As per the annual survey of unincorporated sector enterprises 2022-23, the number of estimated enterprises belonging to the unincorporated sector stands at 6.5 crore. 72.6% of these enterprises operate in the service sector. Many states like Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have a substantial presence of these enterprises. These enterprises, though contributing to the overall development of the economy in terms of employment and income, are losing out on benefits normally offered by incorporation such as tax benefits, and credibility which could help them build better client relationships, access to credit and durability which would help them provide continuity to their business operations etc. States, through policy nudges reducing compliance difficulties, can accelerate the incorporation of these enterprises.\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# State Wise Analysis of Service Sector Performance\n\n## STATE WISE ANALYSIS OF SERVICE SECTOR PERFORMANCE\n\n8.35   The context for presenting the state-specific patterns in industrial and service gross state value added (GSVA) 19   has been mentioned in Chapter 7 of this Survey. The service sector accounts for about 55 per cent of the national GVA in FY25. However, the  distribution  of  service  sector  activity  across  Indian  states  reveals  a  pronounced geographic dispersion. For FY23, Karnataka and Maharashtra account for more than one fourth of the total service sector GSVA of all the states. These states along with Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat together share more than 50 per cent of the total service sector GSVA. These states also have more than 50 per cent of the total industrial GSVA, suggesting that both feed into each other. On the other hand, another set of  19 states collectively account for only one fourth of the service sector GSVA of all the states (Chart VIII.21).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource: Directorate of Economics &amp; Statistics of respective State Governments hosted by MoSPI Note: State codes used in this section;\n\n| State             | Code   | State            | Code   | State     | Code   | State         | Code   |\n|-------------------|--------|------------------|--------|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|\n| Andhra Pradesh    | AP     | Haryana          | HR     | Manipur   | MN     | Sikkim        | SK     |\n| Arunachal Pradesh | AR     | Himachal Pradesh | HP     | Meghalaya | ML     | Tamil Nadu    | TN     |\n| Assam             | AS     | Jharkhand        | JH     | Mizoram   | MZ     | Telangana     | TS     |\n| Bihar             | BR     | Karnataka        | KA     | Nagaland  | NL     | Tripura       | TR     |\n| Chhattisgarh      | CH     | Kerala           | KL     | Odisha    | OD     | Uttarakhand   | UK     |\n| Goa               | GA     | Madhya Pradesh   | MP     | Punjab    | PB     | Uttar Pradesh | UP     |\n| Gujarat           | GJ     | Maharashtra      | MH     | Rajasthan | RJ     | West Bengal   | WB     |\n\n8.36  Among the different service activities, public administration is a unique category that reflects the strength of the state machinery in the state.

This is independent of other services which are largely commercially driven.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.37  The economies of many north eastern states have considerable dependence on the resources of the state and central government because there are natural disadvantages to those regions to pursue large-scale industrialisation and commercial services. (Chart VIII.22)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/XFAGBE+Calibri-Bold&gt;\n\n8.38  There are four different scenarios in the relationship between services share in total GSVA (defined as service intensity of the state economy), and, services GSVA per capita.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n- i.  low service intensity, low per capita service GSVA;\n- ii.  low service intensity, high per capita service GSVA;\n- iii.  high service intensity, low per capita service GSVA; and,\n- iv.  high service intensity, high per capita service GSVA.\n\n8.39   Category  (ii)  above  indicates  that  the  productivity  of  commercial  services  is high.  In  contrast,  category  (iii)  represents  high  dependence  on  commercial  service activities without their being productive enough to generate high levels of income. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn from states falling in the other two categories without analysing supplementary information. However, in category (iv), some state patterns are  very  clear-Karnataka's,  and  to  an  extent,  Telangana's  positions  are  majorly explained by the large presence of IT services, Maharashtra's position is largely due to its strength of financial intermediation activities, and, Kerala's position mainly because of the strong presence of trade, financial and real estate services. The following three charts present service activities that constitute more than two-thirds of the total services GSVA net of public administration. These three charts provide some explanation for the patterns seen in Chart VIII.23.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChart VIII.26: Real estate, ownership of dwelling &amp; professional services: intensity and per capita GSVA across states\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Directorate of Economics &amp; Statistics of respective State Governments hosted by MoSPI\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n8.40   The states like Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, and Mizoram have more than a third of their services GSVA coming from trade, repair, hotels, and restaurants, partly because of  tourism. Many bigger states have trade and repair intensity of close to or higher than the national average indicating a large presence of low value adding trade in these states. Many of these states are relatively less industrialised also (Refer Chapter 7).\n\n8.41     Financial,  real  estate  and  professional  services  have  very  high  levels  of  concentration in a few states. Within the service sector, financial services are highly concentrated with Maharashtra (Mumbai), Tamil Nadu, Gujarat (GIFT City) and Karnataka accounting for more than 50 per cent of total financial services GSVA.  (Maharashtra is not presented in the chart because it is a big positive outlier).\n\n8.42   Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Telangana,  Haryana,  Tamil  Nadu  have  more  than one  third  of  their  services  GSVA  coming  from  real  estate,  ownership  of  dwelling  &amp; professional services. (Karnataka is not presented in the chart because it is a positive outlier). Karnataka (Bengaluru), Telangana (Hyderabad) and Maharashtra (Mumbai), Haryana (Gurugram) and Tamil Nadu (Chennai) have concentration of IT and fintech services leading to high demand for office and residential space.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n8.43  Chart VIII.27 combines the state patterns flowing from this chapter and chapter 7. (Sikkim and Goa are not presented here because they are outliers). It largely indicates the comparative advantages of different states.\n\n8.44   On  the  basis  of  the  above  analysis,  states  can  be  classified  into  four  distinct categories based on their service and industrial performance in terms of per capita GSVA.\n\n- i. States  with  high  per  capita  industrial  GSVA:  These  are  states  like  Gujarat, Uttarakhand,  and  Himachal  Pradesh.  States  like  Chhattisgarh  and  Odisha perform reasonably well in the industrial sector while they have low service sector presence. This indicates that these states will stand to gain largely by accelerating their industrialisation and industrial productivity which will strengthen their  service  sectors  through  the  ongoing  trends  in  greater  'servicification'  of industries. 20\n- ii. Strong  service  sector  performers:  States  such  as  Karnataka,  Telangana  and Kerala excel in services, with high per-capita service GSVA and service shares in GSVA but exhibit only around average industrial per capita GSVA. These regions largely depend on urbanised service-driven economies.\n- iii.    Dual strengths-industrial and service: Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu typically represent  states  with  reasonably  strong  industrial  and  service  sectors.  Their diversified  economies  integrate  manufacturing  with  trade,  financial  services, real estate &amp; professional services.\n- iv. States  with  reform  potential:  While  the  need  for  business  reforms  cuts  across  states in general, the fourth category specifically includes states that have significant potential for reform led development. These states are Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh,  Jharkhand,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Manipur,  Meghalaya,  Nagaland, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.\n\n8.45  As per DPIIT's Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP) 21 , which ranks states based on their performance in introducing business reforms, the states with service intensity backed by industry are the states which have introduced larger numbers of reforms in comparison to their peer states and fall in top achiever and achiever's category.
