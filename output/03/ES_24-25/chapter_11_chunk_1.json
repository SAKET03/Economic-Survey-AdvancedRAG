The government has made significant progress in these areas, but further enhancements are possible through innovation and technology. The social sector expenditure has shown a rising trend, increasing from 23.3% in FY21 to 26.2% in FY25 (BE). The expenditure on education and health has grown at a CAGR of 12% and 18%, respectively. The Household Consumption Expenditure Survey 2023-24 highlights the narrowing urban-rural gap in consumption expenditure, with the average monthly per capita expenditure (MPCE) in rural and urban India estimated at ₹4,122 and ₹6,996, respectively. The Gini coefficient improved for rural and urban areas, indicating reduced inequality. The survey also shows that social sector initiatives have increased consumption spending and reduced inequality. The government has implemented policies to empower citizens, including the National Education Policy 2020, which aims to produce engaged, productive, and contributing citizens. The policy focuses on foundational literacy and numeracy, social and emotional learning, and digital literacy. The school education system serves 24.8 crore students across 14.72 lakh schools with 98 lakh teachers. The government has launched programs to improve school infrastructure, including the provision of toilets, hand wash facilities, and electricity. The National Mission 'National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN Bharat)' aims to ensure that every child attains foundational literacy and numeracy by the end of Grade 3 by 2026-27. The government has also launched initiatives to improve early childhood care and education, including the National Curriculum for ECCE, Aadharshila, and Navchetana.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# SOCIAL SECTOR: EXTENDING REACH AND DRIVING EMPOWERMENT\n\n## SOCIAL SECTOR: EXTENDING REACH AND DRIVING EMPOWERMENT\n\n11\n\nIndia's economic growth strategy emphasises inclusivity and welfare for all its citizens. The government's focus is on empowering citizens through education, healthcare, skill development, and social infrastructure development. All these aspects have seen significant progress. Further enhancements are still possible by improving delivery systems through innovation and technology.\n\nFor example, achieving improved educational outcomes and healthcare access can  be  accomplished  with  innovative  solutions,  such  as  integrating  new teaching methods and preventive healthcare strategies. Peer learning, life skills, and social  and  emotional  learning  hold  great  potential  for  fostering  lifelong learning.  Additionally,  prioritising  mental  health  in  the  workplace  not  only matters for overall well-being and a harmonious society but can also enhance worker productivity. A strong focus on preventing non-communicable diseases combined with the use of technology can be economically effective, significantly reducing the cost burden on healthcare systems.",
