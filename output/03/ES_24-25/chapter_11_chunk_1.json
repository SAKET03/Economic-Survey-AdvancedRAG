The government's focus is on empowering citizens through education, healthcare, skill development, and social infrastructure development. All these aspects have seen significant progress. Further enhancements are still possible by improving delivery systems through innovation and technology.\n\nFor example, achieving improved educational outcomes and healthcare access can  be  accomplished  with  innovative  solutions,  such  as  integrating  new teaching methods and preventive healthcare strategies. Peer learning, life skills, and social  and  emotional  learning  hold  great  potential  for  fostering  lifelong learning.  Additionally,  prioritising  mental  health  in  the  workplace  not  only matters for overall well-being and a harmonious society but can also enhance worker productivity. A strong focus on preventing non-communicable diseases combined with the use of technology can be economically effective, significantly reducing the cost burden on healthcare systems.\n\n##",
