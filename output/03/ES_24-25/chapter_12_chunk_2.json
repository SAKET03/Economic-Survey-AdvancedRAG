The unemployment rate has significantly declined, and labor force participation and worker population ratio have improved. Factory employment data reflects the manufacturing sector's resilience. To capitalize on the demographic dividend, creating quality jobs that offer sustainable livelihoods is crucial. The government aims to align the workforce with global demands by prioritizing reskilling, upskilling, and new-skilling.\\n\\nThe Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) reports a significant decline in the unemployment rate from 6% in 2017-18 to 3.2% in 2023-24. The labor force participation rate (LFPR) and worker-to-population ratio (WPR) have increased, with a broad-based recovery in employment levels across urban and rural areas. The urban unemployment rate has dropped from 6.6% in Q2 FY24 to 6.4% in Q2 FY25. The LFPR increased from 49.3% to 50.4%, and the WPR rose from 46% to 47.2% during the same period.\\n\\nThe proportion of self-employed workers in the workforce has risen from 52.2% in 2017-18 to 58.4% in 2023-24, reflecting growing entrepreneurial activity and a preference for flexible work arrangements. The share of workers in regular/salaried jobs decreased from 22.8% to 21.7%, while casual workers declined from 24.9% to 19.8%. Women's participation in the workforce has increased, with the female labor force participation rate (FLFPR) rising from 23.3% in 2017-18 to 41.7% in 2023-24.\\n\\nThe agriculture sector remains dominant in employment, with its share rising from 44.1% in 2017-18 to 46.1% in 2023-24. The share of female workers in agriculture increased from 57.0% to 64.4%, while male participation decreased from 40.2% to 36.3%. The government has launched initiatives such as Mudra Yojana, Skill India, Start-Up India, and Stand-Up India to foster entrepreneurship and provide skill training.\\n\\nThe average monthly earnings of workers vary across different segments, with regular wage/salaried workers and self-employed workers growing at a CAGR of 5% during 2018-19 to 2023-24. The daily wage of casual workers increased at a CAGR of 9% during the same period. Earnings for self-employed workers showed a dynamic trajectory, with a brief dip from 2017-18 to 2020-21, followed by a significant rebound post-pandemic.\\n\\nThe manufacturing sector has shown resilience, with a more than 7% increase in employment over the previous year. The sector added over 22 lakh jobs in FY23 over FY19. The number of large factories has grown, employing around 80% of total workers and 78% of total persons engaged. Formalization of the job market has increased, with net additions to EPFO subscriptions more than doubling from 61 lakh in FY19 to 131 lakh in FY24.\\n\\nThe government has formulated four Labour Codes to simplify labor laws and foster job creation. The Codes aim to strengthen workers' rights, including statutory minimum wage and timely payment, social security, occupational safety, and healthcare. The government has also launched the eShram portal to recognize unorganized workers and provide them with a Universal Account Number (UAN) and access to social security schemes.\\n\\nThe digital economy has significantly broadened job opportunities, encompassing roles from delivery personnel to software engineers and data analysts. The gig workforce is projected to reach 23.5 crore by 2029-30, comprising 6.7% of the non-agricultural workforce and 4.1% of total livelihoods. The digital economy offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gender gap and positively impact the gender structure of employment.\\n\\nThe renewable energy sector provides an opportunity for job creation, with an estimated 1.02 million jobs in India in 2023. The sector offers opportunities for women to enhance their participation in the labor market. The government has launched initiatives such as the Solar Urja Lamps project and the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) to promote women's empowerment and job creation in the renewable energy sector.\\n\\nIndia's skilling and employment ecosystem is evolving, shaped by factors such as economic policies, technological advancements, and globalisation. The government has launched initiatives such as the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY) and the National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme (NAPS) to promote skill development and employment. The government has also announced a package of five key schemes aimed at benefiting 4.1 crore youth over five years with a central outlay of â‚¹2 lakh crore to promote employment and skilling.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n12.1. As  the  crucial  link  between  growth  and  prosperity,  the  quantity  and  quality  of employment in an economy determines how economic growth sustainably percolates the masses. With around 26 per cent of the population in the age group 10-24 years, India stands at the cusp of a once-in-a-lifetime demographic opportunity. 1  As one of the youngest nations globally, India's economic success depends on integrating its growing workforce  into  productive  and  meaningful  roles,  ensuring  inclusive  and  long-term growth.\n\n12.2.  In 2014, India was ranked as the tenth-largest economy in the world. In under a decade, India surpassed the UK to reach the fourth position. She is poised to be the\n\n1   State of the World Population Report 2024, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) (https://www.unfpa.org/ swp2024)\n\nthird  largest  economy  by  2030,  after  the  USA  and  China.  By  2030,  she  will  have  a growing  working-age  population  and  healthy  manufacturing  sector.  The  country's demographic trend highlights the growing potential for a demographic dividend. 2  The currently young population, with a median age of around 28 years, compared to the ageing population of developed countries, is the key driver of the growth potential. 3\n\n12.3.  The  declining  dependency  ratio 4 ,  marked  by  the  falling  child  dependency  ratio following declining fertility rates, has contributed to this demographic advantage. This is  further supported by a relatively gradual increase in the elderly dependency ratio due to increased life expectancy. 5  The total dependency ratio has declined from 64.6 per cent in 2011 to 55.7 per cent in 2021 and is projected to fall further to 54.3 per cent by 2026. 6   The  expanding  working-age  population  offers  opportunities  for  economic growth, provided these individuals are employed in productive sectors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Report of the Technical Group on Population Projections for India and States 2011-2036, Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare (MoHFW), July, 2020\n\n12.4.    The Economic Survey 2023-24 highlighted that the Indian economy must generate, on average, 78.5 lakh non-farm jobs annually until 2030 to productively engage its growing  working  population.  Creating  quality  jobs  remains  an  ongoing  endeavour and a well-recognised national priority, pivotal to ensuring inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Further, the ambitions and aspirations of the workforce align with the need to generate employment opportunities to leverage the country's demographic dividend and to accelerate the structural transformation from farm to non-farm jobs.\n\n7   Infant mortality rate (or IMR) is the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births during the year.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n12.5. Against this backdrop, this chapter analyses the employment  and  skill development trends and challenges in the economy. The first section delves into the state of employment, focusing on the sectoral and gender distribution of the workforce and  state-wise  trends.  The  second  section  focuses  on  job  creation  and  outlines  the government's actions to enhance employment opportunities. It highlights initiatives such  as  labour  law  reforms,  potential  sectors  for  job  creation,  and  the  role  of  skill development.  The challenge of re-strategising the skills development framework to prepare the youth for evolving industry requirements domestically and internationally is discussed in the third section.",
