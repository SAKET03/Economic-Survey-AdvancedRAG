The country has low per capita carbon emissions but faces challenges in deploying renewable energy due to a lack of storage technology and access to minerals. A strong adaptation strategy is essential given India's vulnerability to climate change. The increase in adaptation expenditures from 3.7% to 5.6% of GDP between FY16 and FY22 indicates the prominence of adaptation and building resilience in the development strategy. The Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) initiative aims to encourage sustainable practices and a circular economy. International finance for climate action remains inadequate. India's per capita carbon emissions are one-third of the global average. The country is committed to low-carbon growth but faces trade-offs in achieving this goal. A fundamental shift in mindset and behavior towards mindful consumption and production is necessary. The LiFE initiative and circular economy are crucial for sustainable development. The country needs to balance growth with environmental concerns. The chapter discusses India's climate change vulnerability, adaptation measures, and energy transition. It highlights the need for a low-carbon development pathway and the challenges associated with it. The chapter also covers the LiFE initiative, circular economy, and resource efficiency measures. India's climate efforts are anchored in its commitment to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. The country aims to become a developed nation by 2047 while ensuring low-carbon development. A delicate balance between growth and environmental concerns is necessary. Mitigation and adaptation strategies are crucial for India's growth strategy. The chapter provides an overview of India's climate change challenges and opportunities.\n\nSubchapter 7 Content:\n# Air Pollution\n\n## AIR POLLUTION\n\n10.60  The World Health Organisation (WHO) data show that almost all of the global population (99 per cent) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. 63   Air pollution is a concern for the people of the northern part of India, especially Delhi and NCR, during the transition months from autumn to winter when pollutant levels frequently exceed the WHO guidelines (Chart 8). While there are anthropogenic reasons for the increase in particulate matter, such as vehicular traffic due to a distinct modal choice for private vehicles, agricultural practices, and use of coal and wood for cooking, geography and wind direction also play an important part in keeping the particulate matter from being dispersed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10.61  The government launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in 2019 as a national-level strategy to reduce air pollution levels in 130 targeted non-attainment cities/million-plus cities across the country by implementing national, state and citylevel action plans. The NCAP emphasises the implementation of City Action Plans (CAPs) through the convergence of resources from various central government schemes such as Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), AMRUT, Smart City Mission, SATAT, and Nagar Van Yojana, as well as through resources from state governments/UT administration and agencies like municipal corporations and urban development authorities.

The GRAP calls for a set of emergent preventive/restrictive actions depending on air pollution levels, to be implemented by the identified agencies for combating the adverse air quality scenario. To address the issue of stubble burning, the government launched a scheme for 'Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh &amp; NCT of Delhi' in 2018, under which financial assistance is provided for the establishment of custom hiring centres (CHCs) and to farmers for purchase of crop residue management machinery.",
