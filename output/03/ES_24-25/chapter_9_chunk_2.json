  "content": "Chapter 9 Summary:\nThe agricultural sector in India has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23. The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, providing a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) to develop and conserve natural resources alongside farming systems. The agricultural sector faces challenges such as climate change, water scarcity, and soil degradation, which require focused and targeted interventions. The sector's growth potential is significant, with opportunities for agro-based entrepreneurship and employment generation. The government has launched several initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). The food processing industry is also a critical sector, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The sector's growth is crucial for ensuring food security and achieving sustainable development goals.\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# Introduction\n\n## INTRODUCTION\n\n- 9.1 The 'Agriculture and Allied Activities' sector has long been the backbone of the Indian economy, playing a vital role in national income and employment. This sector contributes approximately 16 per cent of the country's GDP for FY24 1  (PE) at current prices and supports about 46.1 per cent of the population. Not only does its performance directly impact food security, but it also influences other sectors, sustaining livelihoods and supporting economic growth.\n\n9.2 In recent years, the agriculture sector in India has shown robust growth, averaging 5 per cent 2  annually from FY17 to FY23, demonstrating resilience despite challenges.\n\n- 9.3 In the second quarter of the FY25 year, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5 per cent 3 . This performance represents a recovery compared to the previous four quarters, during which growth rates varied from a modest 0.4 per cent to 2.0 per cent. The recent rise in growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven  by  favourable  weather  patterns,  advancements  in  agricultural  practices,  and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector.\n\n1   Ministry  of  Statistics  and  Program  Implementation  (MOSPI).  https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage. aspx?PRID=2079024\n\n2    Ramesh  Chand  and  Jaspal  Rana,  'Performance  of  Agriculture  Sector  2014-24:  Implications  for  Short-and Medium-term Strategy', Economic and Political Weekly, September 2024, 59(39):70-73\n\n3 https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=2079024.\n\n9.4 Assured  remunerative  prices,  improved  access  to  institutional  credit,  crop diversification,  support  for  sustainable  practices,  and  enhancement  in  productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. Riding on good monsoon, kharif foodgrain production in 2024 is projected at 1647.05 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT), suggesting an increase of 89.37 LMT compared to the previous year and 124.59 LMT above the average kharif foodgrain output 4  bodes well for food security. Agricultural income has increased at 5.23 per cent annually over the past decade, compared to 6.24 per cent for non-agricultural income and 5.80 per cent for the overall economy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 4  First Advance Estimates for 2024-25, Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare\n\n9.5 India's  agriculture  is  characterised  by  diversity,  with  performance  varying significantly across different segments and states. As a major global cereal producer, India accounts for 11.6 per cent of the world's total output. However, crop yields in the  country  are  considerably  lower  compared  to  those  of  other  leading  producers, underscoring the need for productivity improvements. The crop sector has experienced a modest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.1 per cent, from FY13 to FY22. This increase is  also  largely  driven  by  notable  increases  in  the  production  of  fruits, vegetables, and pulses.\n\n## Box IX. 1 :  India's Floriculture: A Sunrise Industry\n\nIndia's  floriculture  industry  has  grown  into  a  high-performing  sector,  earning  its  status as  a  \"sunrise  industry\"  with  a  100  per  cent  export  orientation 5 .  Driven  by  a  growing global demand for flowers, floriculture has evolved into a key commercial venture within agriculture.  Commercial  floriculture  is  particularly  lucrative,  offering  higher  returns  per unit area than many traditional field crops. Profitable avenues in commercial floriculture include cut-flower production, loose-flower production, dry flowers, cut greens, pot plants, flower seeds, perfumes and essential oils. Ramachandra et al. (2007) 6   found that including flowers in rice-based crop sequences gave higher net returns than other sequences, viz. ricesoybean, rice-bell pepper, rice-fodder maize, rice-cowpea and rice-radish. Further, intercropping flowers are more profitable compared to the options of cereals, pulses, vegetables and oilseeds. With subsidy support and crop loan financing, it is a promising venture for marginal  and  small  landholdings,  which  constitute  more  than  96  per  cent  of  the  total landholdings and 63 per cent of the area of cultivation under floriculture.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- 5  https://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/SubHead\\_Products/Floriculture.htm.\n\n6  Ramachandra C., Anwarulla M. S, Janardhan G. and Murthy P. (2007) Production potential and economics of ricebased cropping systems in hill zone of Karnataka, India .International Journal of Agriculture Sciences. 3(2), 127-9.\n\nThe shift from cultivating traditional flowers to export-focused cut flowers highlights the industry's transformation. Entrepreneurs across states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have capitalized on this opportunity, establishing sophisticated export-oriented floriculture units. In FY24, approximately 297 thousand  hectares  were  dedicated  to  floriculture,  yielding  an  estimated  2,284  thousand tonnes of loose flowers and 947 thousand tonnes of cut flowers. During the same period,\n\nIndia exported 19,678 metric tonnes of floriculture products, earning ₹717.83 crore (USD 86.63 million). Key export destinations included the USA, Netherlands, UAE, UK, Canada, and  Malaysia.  With  its  high  growth  trajectory  and  promising  export  potential,  India's floriculture industry is blooming as a vital player in the global flower trade 7 .\n\n9.6 The  slower  growth  rate  of  oilseeds  at  1.9  per  cent  raises  concerns,  especially considering India's heavy reliance on imports to satisfy domestic edible oil demands. High-value sectors such as horticulture, livestock, and fisheries have emerged as the primary contributors  to  the  overall  growth  of  agriculture.  Among  these,  the  fishery sector has demonstrated the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) at 13.67 per cent, followed by livestock with a CAGR of 12.99 per cent 8  during FY15 to FY23(at current prices).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.7 Diversity is also seen in inter-state variations in growth observed from 2011-12 to 2020-21. Andhra Pradesh was the leading performer with a CAGR of 8.8 per cent in agriculture and allied sectors, excluding forestry and logging. Madhya Pradesh followed with 6.3 per cent, and Tamil Nadu came in third with 4.8 per cent among major states. 9\n\n7  https://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/SubHead\\_Products/Floriculture.htm.\n\n8  Department of animal Husbandry and Dairying.\n\n9  Price Policy, Report Kharif 2024-25, Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices.\n\nThese states have diversified towards crops where yield is high. For example, Andhra Pradesh diversified towards jowar, Madhya Pradesh towards moong and Tamil Nadu towards  maize.  Even  so,  there  is  significant  potential  to  enhance  productivity  and reduce the yield gap compared to the global average.\n\n9.8 As  we  look  to  the  future,  it's  important  to  consider  how  changing  dietary preferences, driven by rising incomes, will influence the agricultural sector's growth trajectory. The increasing consumption of non-food grains, particularly horticultural products,  livestock,  and  fisheries,  will  be  significant.  Given  the  perishable  nature of  these  high-value  commodities,  effective  post-harvest  management  and  robust marketing  infrastructure  are  essential.  This  endeavour  should  be  supported  by  the active involvement of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), cooperatives, and SelfHelp  Groups  (SHGs).  Furthermore,  substantial  investment  from  the  private  sector would also be vital to aid small-scale farmers.\n\n## BOX IX.2 : Transforming Rural Economies: The Rise of Horticulture\n\nIndia's horticulture sector is more productive and profitable than traditional agriculture, emerging as a fast-growing industry. This can be seen from the fact that India is also a leading  exporter,  shipping  343,982.34  MT  of  fresh  grapes  worth  ₹3,460.70  crore  (USD 417.07 million) globally in 2023-24 10 . Key grape-growing states are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Mizoram. Maharashtra leads in production, contributing over 67 per cent of total output with the highest productivity in 2023-24 11 . Grape cultivation has significantly improved the livelihoods of Nashik farmers where export-quality grapes fetch higher prices (₹65-70/kg) than domestic markets. This economic upliftment has attracted rural youth to grape farming. Farmers have adopted advanced technologies like real-time monitoring systems to ensure optimal grape quality.  The Nashik grape story shows how export-oriented agriculture,  technology,  and  collective  efforts  can  transform  a  region's  socio-economic conditions.\n\n9.9 The  government  is  implementing  a  range  of  initiatives  aimed  at  enhancing agricultural  productivity  and  increasing  farmers'  incomes,  in  alignment  with  the recommendations put forth in the Doubling Farmers' Income (DFI) Report  2016. This report highlighted essential strategies for improving crop and livestock productivity, boosting  cropping  intensity,  and  diversifying  into  high-value  crops.  Committed  to promoting  greater  input  efficiency  and  adopting  sustainable  production  practices, the  government  is  pursuing  initiatives  such  as  Per  Drop  More  Crop  (PDMC)  and various actions under the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). These measures  include  using  alternative  and  organic  fertilisers  to  enhance  productivity and sustainability. Furthermore, digital initiatives like the Digital Agriculture Mission and  the  e-National  Agriculture  Market  (e-NAM)  have  been  launched  to  encourage the  adoption  of  innovative  agricultural  technologies  and  improve  price  discovery mechanisms.  Additionally,  the  government  provides  income  support  to  farmers through assured remunerative prices for their produce, alongside programs such as the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN).\n\n10   https://apeda.gov.in/apedawebsite/six\\_head\\_product/Fresh\\_Fruits\\_Vegetables.htm 11 Ibid.",
