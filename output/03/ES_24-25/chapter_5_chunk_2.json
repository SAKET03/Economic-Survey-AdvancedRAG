It highlights the challenges posed by geo-economic fragmentation and the rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse.\\n\\n### Global Economic Environment\\n\\n* The global economy is experiencing a backsliding of economic integration, with geo-economic fragmentation replacing globalization.\\n* The rise of China as a manufacturing powerhouse and its impact on the global supply chain pose challenges to other nations.\\n* India is in the middle of a significant economic change, representing both an unprecedented challenge and opportunity.\\n\\n### India's Medium-Term Outlook\\n\\n* To achieve its economic aspirations of becoming Viksit Bharat, India needs to achieve a growth rate of around 8% at constant prices for about a decade or two.\\n* The IMF projects India to become a USD 5 trillion economy by FY28 and reach a size of USD 6.307 trillion by FY30, translating into an annual nominal growth rate of nearly 10.2% in USD terms.\\n* In rupee terms, India's nominal GDP grew at a compounded annual rate of 12.4% in the three decades ending FY24, and the IMF projects it to grow at around 10.7% annually in the next five years.\\n\\n### Geo-Economic Fragmentation\\n\\n* Geo-economic fragmentation (GEF) refers to a policy-driven reversal of global economic integration, often guided by strategic considerations.\\n* GEF can lead to a decline in global trade, investment, and economic growth, with estimated output losses ranging from 0.2% to 7% of GDP.\\n* The global economy is experiencing a significant increase in trade-restrictive measures, with a sharp rise in the coverage of trade-restrictive measures by WTO members.\\n\\n### The Elephant and the Dragon in the Room\\n\\n* China's dominant role in global manufacturing and energy transition ecosystems is reshaping the economic landscape.\\n* China's rise as a manufacturing colossus has disrupted industries in other economies, and its strategic advantage in critical resources poses potential dependencies for posterity.\\n* The effects of climate change are well-documented, with a 1Â°C warming reducing global GDP by 12%.\\n\\n### Climate Transition, China, and Geopolitics\\n\\n* India has ambitious goals for energy transition, with a focus on renewable energy, especially solar and wind.\\n* China dominates the global supply chain for solar panels, wind turbines, and battery manufacturing, with over 80% of the world's solar panels manufactured in China.\\n* India's dependence on China-made goods for energy transition efforts enhances the complexity of the challenge.\\n\\n### Implications for India's Growth Prospects\\n\\n* To achieve its growth and development goals, India needs to focus on domestic growth levers and enhance economic freedom through deregulation.\\n* The government has implemented several structural reforms, including the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), and digital infrastructure.\\n* However, regulatory compliance burden holds back formalization and labor productivity, limits employment growth, and chokes innovation.\\n\\n### Reinvigorating the Internal Engines of Growth - Enhancing Economic Freedom through Deregulation\\n\\n* Deregulation is critical for MSME growth, and compliance costs are non-trivial for MSMEs.\\n* The government has undertaken deregulation efforts, including process and governance reforms, simplifying taxation laws, rationalizing labor regulations, and decriminalizing business laws.\\n* States have also participated in deregulation by reducing compliance burdens and simplifying processes.\\n\\n### Deregulation and Economic Freedom: A Catalyst for Growth\\n\\n* Systematic deregulation is essential for India's growth aspirations, and states can undertake systematic deregulation by reviewing regulations for their cost-effectiveness.\\n* The focus on Mittelstand has played a pivotal role in the economic success of countries like Germany, Switzerland, Japan, and Singapore.\\n* Deregulation can catalyze growth, innovation, and competitiveness, and states must prioritize deregulation to enhance economic freedom.\\n\\n### Key Policy Recommendations\\n\\n* Focus on domestic growth levers and enhance economic freedom through deregulation.\\n* Implement systematic deregulation to reduce/remove regulatory compliance burden.\\n* Encourage economic freedom for individuals and organizations to pursue legitimate economic activity.\\n* Focus on creating an enabling policy and regulatory environment for the upgradation of capacity and know-how of component manufacturers.\\n\\n### Conclusion\\n\\nIndia's growth aspirations require a renewed paradigm for medium-term growth, focusing on deregulation and economic freedom. Systematic deregulation is critical for India's growth aspirations, and states must prioritize deregulation to enhance economic freedom. By empowering small businesses, enhancing economic freedom, and ensuring a level playing field, governments can help create an environment where growth and innovation are not only possible but inevitable.\"}}\n\nSubchapter 2 Content:\n# The Elephant and The Dragon in the Room\n\n## THE ELEPHANT AND THE DRAGON IN THE ROOM\n\n5.16   Fundamental  shifts  in  global  economic  engagement  are  underway  with  the proliferation  of  trade  and  investment  restrictions.  Between  2020  and  2024,  over\n\n8  International  Monetary  Fund.  Research  Dept.  (2023).  \"Chapter  4  Geoeconomic  Fragmentation  and  Foreign Direct Investment\". In World Economic Outlook, April 2023: A Rocky Recovery, https://tinyurl.com/5n7etwfz.\n\n24000 new restrictions related to trade and investments have gone into place globally [Chart V.3]. The impact of this shift in global structural forces is reflected in global trade growth, which has slowed down significantly, and signs of secular stagnation in the global economy are beginning to emerge [Chart V.4]. The Preface to this document also devoted considerable space to the unfavourable global backdrop for India's growth prospects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n5.17   The global economy is at a significant juncture where long-held principles and practices are being re-evaluated and, in some cases, losing their relevance. Adding to this shift is China's prominent role in global supply chains, which continues to reshape the economic landscape. As a result, many countries now operate in an environment markedly different from what they were accustomed to, with traditional rules being reconsidered and uncertainty surrounding what might replace them.\n\n5.18   China  is  a  dominant  force  in  the  global  manufacturing  and  energy  transition ecosystems.  It  has  gained  a  strategic  advantage  leveraging  its  competitiveness  and economic policy to access and control key resources recognised today as critical for global supply chains. \" In the year 2000, the United States and its allies in Asia, Europe, and  Latin  America  accounted  for  the  overwhelming  majority  of  global  industrial production, with China at just 6 per cent even after two decades of rapid growth. Just thirty years later, UNIDO projects that China will account for 45 per cent of all  global manufacturing, singlehandedly matching or outmatching the US and its allies. This is a level of manufacturing dominance by a single country seen only twice before in world history - by the UK at the start of the Industrial Revolution and by the US just after World War 2. It means that in an extended war of production, there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  entire  world  united  could  defeat  China  alone \" (Chart V.5). 9,10\n\n9  UNIDO National Account Database; https://stat.unido.org/data/table?dataset=national-accounts.\n\n10    Noah Smith, 'Manufacturing is a war now', 4th December 2024, https://tinyurl.com/bdhdzrma.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: UNIDO elaboration based on UNIDO National Accounts Database\n\nNote: UNIDO Projections to 2030 are based on historical average annual growth rates (between 2010 and 2019) and applied to the latest available observations (2024) up to 2030.

China's resurgence was foretold in 1904 by British geographer and diplomat Halford  Mackinder. 11   Courtesy  of  these  developments,  the  world's  modus  operandi of outsourcing manufacturing to China pursued vigorously in the globalisation era is poised for a reset.",
