## CLIMATE TRANSITION, CHINA AND GEOPOLITICS

5.20  Climate is a global public good. It impacts everyone, everywhere, in ways that are still being examined and understood. Edward N. Lorenz famously wondered in a 1972 paper, ' Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas ' 12 ? This perhaps holds now more than ever.

5.21   The economic impact of climate change is well documented. The direct cost of climate change has received significant academic attention. 13  Studies have quantified

5.22  China, the United States, the EU, and other G7 economies produce more than 50 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. All have target dates of 2050 to reach net-zero  emissions.  These  economies  depend  heavily  on  each  other  in  the  trade  of environmental  goods  and  technologies  central  to  developing  renewable  energy  and reducing emissions. Hence, trade conflicts between these economies will pose significant risks to the green energy transition, imposing huge costs on the global economy.

5.23  As for India, the five nectar elements distil our commitment to climate action (Panchamrit). 15 This  would  significantly  impact  how  India  produces,  procures  and meets its energy requirements, and the shift would necessitate a change in our energy mix. A projection of the installed capacity in 2030 [as compared to 2020] 16  shows that the share of renewable energy, especially solar and wind, in the installed capacity is likely to increase substantially. In contrast, the share of Coal and Lignite is likely to fall sharply [Charts V.7, 8].

5.24   As  the  world  navigates  the  challenges  of  climate  change,  the  road  to  energy transition runs through China.

5.25  Over the last decade, global solar photovoltaic cell (PV) manufacturing capacity has increasingly moved from Europe, Japan and the United States to China, which has invested more than USD 50 billion in new PV supply capacity - ten times more than Europe. 17  The dominance of China in the environmental goods sector deserves serious consideration. China's share of solar panels (polysilicon, ingots, wafers, cells, and modules) exceeds 80 per cent in all the manufacturing stages. Interestingly, this is more than double China's share of global PV demand. China's contribution to the manufacture of various solar PV components from 2010 to 2021 is captured as under (Charts V.9, 10). In addition, the country is home to the world's top 10 suppliers of solar PV manufacturing equipment. 18  While this has been a major contributing factor in bringing down the costs of solar PV equipment worldwide, the level of geographical concentration in global supply chains also creates supply disruption risks that must be kept in mind.

5.26  About 60 per cent of the world's wind installed capacity is sourced from China. China also houses nearly 80 per cent of the world's battery manufacturing capacity, pivotal  to  the  energy  transition. 19 In  2022  alone,  China  allocated  USD  546  billion towards various investments in solar and wind energy, electric vehicles, and battery technologies  vis-à-vis  US  and  EU  investments  in  these  sectors,  which  amounted  to USD 321 billion in the same year. 20

5.27  On the solar front, China controls the supply of primary materials, manufacturing, installed capacity, and recycling capacity and produces at least 80  per cent of the main components of PVs. 21  China's vertical integration across the entire electric vehicle (EV) supply  chain,  from  mining  to  EV  manufacturing,  has  enabled  it  to  retain  its  global dominance in this  sector.  It  is  also  pertinent  to  note  that  about  70  per  cent  of  the world's rare earth minerals, which are critical resources for high-storage batteries, are processed by Chinese companies 22  (See Box V.1)

## Box V.1: Supply Chain Considerations for Electric Vehicles

Mitigating road transport emissions, which comprise nearly 75 per cent of the emissions from the transportation sector, 23 is critical to India achieving its Net Zero goals by 2070. Electric mobility is an important element in India's path to Net Zero. India has made impressive strides

in promoting the domestic manufacture of Electric Vehicles (EV). However, to sustain the growth momentum, there are some important considerations to keep in mind. For instance, manufacturing an Electric Vehicle, relative to a conventional car, requires nearly 6 times more minerals to produce 24 , most of which are utilised in producing the EV battery. This is an important consideration as many minerals crucial to EV manufacturing are scarcely available or processed in India while simultaneously being concentrated in very few countries. The Ministry of Mines has analysed the 33 critical minerals vital to India's economic security and found that 24 are currently at high risk of supply disruptions 25 .

China commands a significant share of critical mineral processing and production globally. Across key commodities such as Nickel, Cobalt, and Lithium, China alone is responsible for processing 65 per cent, 68 per cent and 60 per cent of the global output, respectively 26 . Similarly, in the case of Rare Earth Minerals, China contributes to 63 per cent of global mining and 90 per cent of global processing output. Moreover, lithium-ion batteries will dominate other technologies for quite some time, and their demand is expected to grow at a CAGR of 23 per cent by 2030 27 . The lack of viable alternative battery technologies reinforces China's dominant position in Lithium-ion batteries.

The pursuit of India's vision to decarbonise road transportation has been accompanied by  impressive  strides  in  the  promotion  of  domestic  manufacturing  facilitated  by schemes such as FAME India, the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme for Auto Components, and the  Scheme  for  Promotion  of  Manufacturing  of  Electric  Passenger Cars in India (SPMEPCI) among others. These schemes demonstrate the Government of  India's  awareness  of  the  need  to  build  domestic  supply  chains.  These  are  good foundations. Future policies will have to broaden their scope of coverage in a manner that adapts to the growing needs of the EV industry. As demand for EVs is expected to  grow, dependence on imported components such as DC motors, e-motor magnets, and other electrical  parts  will  likely  rise 28 .  Leading  EV  manufacturers  have  noted  an increasing proportion of Chinese imports in their total material expenditures, reflecting a significant dependence on China for certain resources and technical knowhow. 29

Initiatives  such  as  the  PLI  Scheme  for  Advanced  Chemistry  Cell  Manufacturing  and  the setting up of Khanji Bidesh India Limited (KABIL) have been undertaken to deal with such risks. Going forward, policies for electric vehicles must focus on de-risking supply chains by promoting a more self-reliant ecosystem powered by increased R&amp;D in advanced battery technologies, such as Sodium-ion and Solid-State Batteries. Securing intellectual property in this domain can prove invaluable. Additionally, facilitating investment in battery recycling

infrastructure can yield greater long-term gains for the Indian automotive sector. In the interim, PLI Schemes can also reward the making of EV cells (Lithium-ion cells), as most manufacturing and value addition happens up to the cell-making stage. Furthermore, India must  aim  to  establish  technology  transfer  agreements  with  other  nations  that  are  also seeking to diversify their supply chains. Partnerships with other aspiring nations can help distribute the high costs of securing a comparative advantage in the global market.

5.28  Expanding the public transportation network is another avenue of reducing dependence on overseas supply chains that E-Mobility entails and will entail for quite some time to come. Indian cities are making heavy investments - and rightly so  -  in  metro  rail  networks  and  expanding  their  coverage.  In  Brazil  and  China, more than 50 per cent of urban residents enjoy convenient access to mass transit. However, in India, only 37 per cent of urban residents have easy access to public transportation.  To  replicate  the  success  of  other  nations,  India  must  focus  on developing integrated transport systems that efficiently connect buses, metro rails, and other modes of transit. Investing in making public transportation more efficient, reliable,  comfortable,  accessible,  and  safe  will  also  be  a  significant  step  towards achieving Net Zero goals while reducing our dependence on imports. Moreover, a robust public transportation system will also help reduce traffic congestion, promote energy efficiency, and ensure that the benefits of clean mobility are accessible to all  socioeconomic  groups,  unlike  private  e-mobility  solutions,  fostering  a  more resilient and equitable energy transition.

5.29   It  may  be  emphasised  that  India  has  made  significant  strides  in  promoting renewable  energy  and  boosting  domestic  manufacturing  of  renewable  energy equipment through initiatives such as the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. The PLI scheme aims to enhance India's manufacturing capabilities in key sectors, including solar panels, wind turbines, and battery storage, by offering incentives to domestic manufacturers. The domestic manufacturing efforts under the PLI scheme are expected to significantly support India's renewable energy targets by reducing costs, improving energy security, and boosting employment. Domestic capacities are being built. For now, India sources 75 per cent of lithium-ion batteries from China, and it has near negligible production capacity for key components like polysilicon, ingots, and wafers.

5.30  In a hypothetical scenario, the IMF shows that where the trade of critical minerals between blocs is disrupted, investment in renewable energy and EVs could be lower by

as much as 30 per cent by 2030 compared to an unfragmented world. 30  The nature and threat of GEF are augmented by the fact that basic institutional structures that safeguarded the principles of multilateralism also find themselves at a crossroads. With this global backdrop, we turn to how India could achieve its growth and development goals.
