5.16   Fundamental  shifts  in  global  economic  engagement  are  underway  with  the proliferation  of  trade  and  investment  restrictions.  Between  2020  and  2024,  over

24000 new restrictions related to trade and investments have gone into place globally [Chart V.3]. The impact of this shift in global structural forces is reflected in global trade growth, which has slowed down significantly, and signs of secular stagnation in the global economy are beginning to emerge [Chart V.4]. The Preface to this document also devoted considerable space to the unfavourable global backdrop for India's growth prospects.

5.17   The global economy is at a significant juncture where long-held principles and practices are being re-evaluated and, in some cases, losing their relevance. Adding to this shift is China's prominent role in global supply chains, which continues to reshape the economic landscape. As a result, many countries now operate in an environment markedly different from what they were accustomed to, with traditional rules being reconsidered and uncertainty surrounding what might replace them.

5.18   China  is  a  dominant  force  in  the  global  manufacturing  and  energy  transition ecosystems.  It  has  gained  a  strategic  advantage  leveraging  its  competitiveness  and economic policy to access and control key resources recognised today as critical for global supply chains. " In the year 2000, the United States and its allies in Asia, Europe, and  Latin  America  accounted  for  the  overwhelming  majority  of  global  industrial production, with China at just 6 per cent even after two decades of rapid growth. Just thirty years later, UNIDO projects that China will account for 45 per cent of all  global manufacturing, singlehandedly matching or outmatching the US and its allies. This is a level of manufacturing dominance by a single country seen only twice before in world history - by the UK at the start of the Industrial Revolution and by the US just after World War 2. It means that in an extended war of production, there  is  no  guarantee  that  the  entire  world  united  could  defeat  China  alone " (Chart V.5). 9,10

5.19  The effects of the rise of China as a manufacturing colossus are seen in automobile (especially electric vehicles) manufacturing, mining and refining capacity for critical minerals (Copper, Lithium, Nickel, Cobalt, Graphite, etc.) and in clean energy equipment, etc.  China's  rise  in  the  global  auto  market  has  disrupted  the  long-term  incumbents in  economies  like  Germany  and  Japan,  and  it  dominates  the  global  distribution  of critical  minerals  and  other  economic  resources,  creating  potential  dependencies  for posterity. China's resurgence was foretold in 1904 by British geographer and diplomat Halford  Mackinder. 11   Courtesy  of  these  developments,  the  world's  modus  operandi of outsourcing manufacturing to China pursued vigorously in the globalisation era is poised for a reset.
