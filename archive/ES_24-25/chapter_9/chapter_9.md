## AGRICULTURE AND FOOD MANAGEMENT: SECTOR OF THE FUTURE

<!-- image -->

India's  agricultural  sector  has  demonstrated  remarkable  resilience  in  recent years,  marked  by  consistent  growth  rates.  This  stability  can  be  largely attributed to various government initiatives to enhance productivity, promote crop diversification, and increase farmers' income. A crucial factor influencing agricultural performance is the impact of weather conditions. Climate variability can  present  significant  challenges;  however,  farmers  with  diverse  income streams are better positioned to navigate these uncertainties. Allied activities such as animal husbandry, fisheries or agroforestry, can enable the farmers to mitigate the risks effectively. Various government initiatives are specifically designed to address these challenges.

## INTRODUCTION

- 9.1 The 'Agriculture and Allied Activities' sector has long been the backbone of the Indian economy, playing a vital role in national income and employment. This sector contributes approximately 16 per cent of the country's GDP for FY24 1  (PE) at current prices and supports about 46.1 per cent of the population. Not only does its performance directly impact food security, but it also influences other sectors, sustaining livelihoods and supporting economic growth.

9.2 In recent years, the agriculture sector in India has shown robust growth, averaging 5 per cent 2  annually from FY17 to FY23, demonstrating resilience despite challenges.

- 9.3 In the second quarter of the FY25 year, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5 per cent 3 . This performance represents a recovery compared to the previous four quarters, during which growth rates varied from a modest 0.4 per cent to 2.0 per cent. The recent rise in growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven  by  favourable  weather  patterns,  advancements  in  agricultural  practices,  and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector.

9.4 Assured  remunerative  prices,  improved  access  to  institutional  credit,  crop diversification,  support  for  sustainable  practices,  and  enhancement  in  productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. Riding on good monsoon, kharif foodgrain production in 2024 is projected at 1647.05 Lakh Metric Tonnes (LMT), suggesting an increase of 89.37 LMT compared to the previous year and 124.59 LMT above the average kharif foodgrain output 4  bodes well for food security. Agricultural income has increased at 5.23 per cent annually over the past decade, compared to 6.24 per cent for non-agricultural income and 5.80 per cent for the overall economy.

9.5 India's  agriculture  is  characterised  by  diversity,  with  performance  varying significantly across different segments and states. As a major global cereal producer, India accounts for 11.6 per cent of the world's total output. However, crop yields in the  country  are  considerably  lower  compared  to  those  of  other  leading  producers, underscoring the need for productivity improvements. The crop sector has experienced a modest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.1 per cent, from FY13 to FY22. This increase is  also  largely  driven  by  notable  increases  in  the  production  of  fruits, vegetables, and pulses.

## Box IX. 1 :  India's Floriculture: A Sunrise Industry

India's  floriculture  industry  has  grown  into  a  high-performing  sector,  earning  its  status as  a  "sunrise  industry"  with  a  100  per  cent  export  orientation 5 .  Driven  by  a  growing global demand for flowers, floriculture has evolved into a key commercial venture within agriculture.  Commercial  floriculture  is  particularly  lucrative,  offering  higher  returns  per unit area than many traditional field crops. Profitable avenues in commercial floriculture include cut-flower production, loose-flower production, dry flowers, cut greens, pot plants, flower seeds, perfumes and essential oils. Ramachandra et al. (2007) 6   found that including flowers in rice-based crop sequences gave higher net returns than other sequences, viz. ricesoybean, rice-bell pepper, rice-fodder maize, rice-cowpea and rice-radish. Further, intercropping flowers are more profitable compared to the options of cereals, pulses, vegetables and oilseeds. With subsidy support and crop loan financing, it is a promising venture for marginal  and  small  landholdings,  which  constitute  more  than  96  per  cent  of  the  total landholdings and 63 per cent of the area of cultivation under floriculture.

The shift from cultivating traditional flowers to export-focused cut flowers highlights the industry's transformation. Entrepreneurs across states like Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have capitalized on this opportunity, establishing sophisticated export-oriented floriculture units. In FY24, approximately 297 thousand  hectares  were  dedicated  to  floriculture,  yielding  an  estimated  2,284  thousand tonnes of loose flowers and 947 thousand tonnes of cut flowers. During the same period,

India exported 19,678 metric tonnes of floriculture products, earning ₹717.83 crore (USD 86.63 million). Key export destinations included the USA, Netherlands, UAE, UK, Canada, and  Malaysia.  With  its  high  growth  trajectory  and  promising  export  potential,  India's floriculture industry is blooming as a vital player in the global flower trade 7 .

9.6 The  slower  growth  rate  of  oilseeds  at  1.9  per  cent  raises  concerns,  especially considering India's heavy reliance on imports to satisfy domestic edible oil demands. High-value sectors such as horticulture, livestock, and fisheries have emerged as the primary contributors  to  the  overall  growth  of  agriculture.  Among  these,  the  fishery sector has demonstrated the highest compound annual growth rate (CAGR) at 13.67 per cent, followed by livestock with a CAGR of 12.99 per cent 8  during FY15 to FY23(at current prices).

9.7 Diversity is also seen in inter-state variations in growth observed from 2011-12 to 2020-21. Andhra Pradesh was the leading performer with a CAGR of 8.8 per cent in agriculture and allied sectors, excluding forestry and logging. Madhya Pradesh followed with 6.3 per cent, and Tamil Nadu came in third with 4.8 per cent among major states. 9

These states have diversified towards crops where yield is high. For example, Andhra Pradesh diversified towards jowar, Madhya Pradesh towards moong and Tamil Nadu towards  maize.  Even  so,  there  is  significant  potential  to  enhance  productivity  and reduce the yield gap compared to the global average.

9.8 As  we  look  to  the  future,  it's  important  to  consider  how  changing  dietary preferences, driven by rising incomes, will influence the agricultural sector's growth trajectory. The increasing consumption of non-food grains, particularly horticultural products,  livestock,  and  fisheries,  will  be  significant.  Given  the  perishable  nature of  these  high-value  commodities,  effective  post-harvest  management  and  robust marketing  infrastructure  are  essential.  This  endeavour  should  be  supported  by  the active involvement of Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs), cooperatives, and SelfHelp  Groups  (SHGs).  Furthermore,  substantial  investment  from  the  private  sector would also be vital to aid small-scale farmers.

## BOX IX.2 : Transforming Rural Economies: The Rise of Horticulture

India's horticulture sector is more productive and profitable than traditional agriculture, emerging as a fast-growing industry. This can be seen from the fact that India is also a leading  exporter,  shipping  343,982.34  MT  of  fresh  grapes  worth  ₹3,460.70  crore  (USD 417.07 million) globally in 2023-24 10 . Key grape-growing states are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Mizoram. Maharashtra leads in production, contributing over 67 per cent of total output with the highest productivity in 2023-24 11 . Grape cultivation has significantly improved the livelihoods of Nashik farmers where export-quality grapes fetch higher prices (₹65-70/kg) than domestic markets. This economic upliftment has attracted rural youth to grape farming. Farmers have adopted advanced technologies like real-time monitoring systems to ensure optimal grape quality.  The Nashik grape story shows how export-oriented agriculture,  technology,  and  collective  efforts  can  transform  a  region's  socio-economic conditions.

9.9 The  government  is  implementing  a  range  of  initiatives  aimed  at  enhancing agricultural  productivity  and  increasing  farmers'  incomes,  in  alignment  with  the recommendations put forth in the Doubling Farmers' Income (DFI) Report  2016. This report highlighted essential strategies for improving crop and livestock productivity, boosting  cropping  intensity,  and  diversifying  into  high-value  crops.  Committed  to promoting  greater  input  efficiency  and  adopting  sustainable  production  practices, the  government  is  pursuing  initiatives  such  as  Per  Drop  More  Crop  (PDMC)  and various actions under the National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA). These measures  include  using  alternative  and  organic  fertilisers  to  enhance  productivity and sustainability. Furthermore, digital initiatives like the Digital Agriculture Mission and  the  e-National  Agriculture  Market  (e-NAM)  have  been  launched  to  encourage the  adoption  of  innovative  agricultural  technologies  and  improve  price  discovery mechanisms.  Additionally,  the  government  provides  income  support  to  farmers through assured remunerative prices for their produce, alongside programs such as the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN).

## CROP PRODUCTION: Incentivising productivity increase, crop diversification and efficiency in the use of inputs

9.10 Despite the increase in crop production, further enhancements in productivity across  various  crops  and  regions  are  vital  for  boosting  performance  and  positively influencing farmers' incomes. Productivity is closely linked to on-farm and post-harvest inputs such as improved access to quality seeds, better irrigation facilities, efficient water management practices, effective extension services, soil health improvements, modern post-harvest infrastructure, and accessible markets. Additionally, agricultural price policies play a crucial role in facilitating informed decision-making by protecting farmers from market price volatility and encouraging them to diversify their crops, promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

<!-- image -->

9.11    The  Minimum  Support  Price  (MSP)  for  essential  crops  such  as  wheat,  rice, pulses, oilseeds, and nutri-cereals acts as a safety net for farmers, reassuring them of a guaranteed minimum price for their crops from the government. This mechanism also serves as a guiding signal for farmers in planning their future crop compositions. In the Union Budget of 2018-19, the government decided the principle of fixing MSP at a level of at least 1.5 times the weighted average cost of production for these crops. The support provides the necessary returns to promote sustainable farming practices and encourage farmers to focus on cultivating key crops. The government has raised the MSP for nutri cereals (Shree Anna), pulses, and oilseeds as part of these initiatives. For the fiscal year FY25, the MSP for arhar and bajra has been increased by 59 per cent and 77 per cent over the weighted average cost of production, respectively. Moreover, the MSP for Masur has risen by 89 per cent, while rapeseed has seen an impressive increase of 98 per cent.

## SEEDS-QUALITY AND USE OF FERTILISERS: The Critical Differentiator

9.12 The adage 'As you sow, so shall you reap' effectively reflects the significance of seed quality and the accessibility of seeds in sufficient quantities by farmers in promoting healthy crop growth. In the 2023-24 season, ICAR produced 1.06 lakh quintals of breeder seeds encompassing 1,798 varieties across 81 crops for further multiplication. Given the impact of weather on agricultural output, research into climate-resistant seeds has become a priority, with 2,177 of the 2,593 new varieties released since 2014 specifically addressing this challenge. To ensure that these varieties are readily available, seed banks have been established. In regions such as north-western India, heat-tolerant wheat varieties have seen widespread adoption to alleviate the effects of heat stress. In FY24, demonstrations of climate-resilient technology packages were conducted in 121 vulnerable districts under the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture initiative.

9.13 Soil  degradation,  particularly  the  decline  in  organic  carbon  content,  poses a  significant  challenge  to  Indian  agriculture.  Many  soils  in  India  are  deficient  in organic  carbon,  macronutrients,  and  essential  micronutrients  such  as  boron,  iron, and sulphur. This deterioration of soil health adversely affects fertility, productivity, and overall agricultural sustainability. To achieve optimal crop yields while ensuring environmental  sustainability,  it  is  imperative  to  use  fertilisers  judiciously.  Recently introduced, 'Urea Gold' combines urea with sulphur, minimizing wastage and enhancing plant nutrient uptake. Additionally, the use of drones and fertigation 12   techniques are being implemented to optimize fertiliser applications. The Programme for Restoration, Awareness  Generation,  Nourishment,  and  Amelioration  of  Mother  Earth  (PMPRANAM) initiative incentivises states to adopt alternative fertilisers  such  as  Nano Urea, Nano Diammonium phosphate (DAP), and organic fertilisers. By promoting these sustainable options, the government aims to improve soil health, reduce environmental pollution, and boost agricultural productivity.

## RAINFALL AND IRRIGATION SYSTEM: Building Efficiency and Extending Coverage

9.14 Precipitation is  crucial  in  the  global  water  cycle,  serving  as  a  primary  source for  freshwater  replenishment,  vital  for  various  ecosystems  and  human  activities. The  repercussions  of  climate  change  on  rainfall  patterns  are  profound,  particularly concerning agricultural practices that rely heavily on consistent and predictable weather conditions (Porter et al., 2014) 13 .

9.15 In India, while the volatility in agricultural growth has notably diminished over time due to targeted interventions, the sector remains highly vulnerable to weather

12    Fertigation is a method of fertiliser application in which fertiliser is incorporated within the irrigation water by the drip system.

variability, with only about 55 per cent of the net sown area receiving irrigation 14 . A substantial  portion  of  the  agricultural  land  relies  on  rain-fed  systems,  making  it especially  susceptible  to  fluctuations  in  precipitation.  Moreover,  more  than  twothirds of India's agricultural land faces the threat of drought, with national estimates indicating a 35 per cent probability of drought occurrences 15 . This risk is not uniform across the country; it varies considerably based on geographies. For instance, in dryhumid regions, the likelihood of drought is relatively lower at about 20 per cent, while in arid zones, it can exceed 40 per cent. Such disparities emphasise the urgent need for region-specific strategies to mitigate drought risk 16 .

9.16   The  implications  of  erratic  monsoon  patterns  are  particularly  pronounced  for marginal and small-scale farmers, representing approximately 85 per cent of India's agricultural holdings. These farmers typically cultivate on plots less than 2 hectares in size, making them highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability. 17 .

Not only has there been an increase in the number of years with deficient rainfall at an all-India level, but more subdivisions 19 have experienced rainfall deficits- reflecting an increase in the frequency and the geographic spread of droughts. At the same time, there are also more intense short wet spells. In central India, the frequency of extreme daily rainfall events exceeding 150 mm has increased by about 75 per cent from 1950 to 2015 20 .

9.18 Several  studies  have  also  assessed  the  overall  effect  of  climate  change  on agricultural  production.  Negi  and  Ramaswami  (2024) 21   examined  the  relationship between crop yields and rainfall across India at the district level for nine key crops during  the  kharif  season.  They  found  a  strong  link  between  significant  rainfall shortfalls and substantial crop yield losses. This statistical phenomenon is known as lower tail dependence, indicating that the correlation between yield losses and rainfall deficits is stronger for extreme rainfall deficiencies than for minor variations. Other studies have indicated that a potential 2°C rise in annual temperature and a 7 per cent increase in annual rainfall by 2099 could lead to an 8-12 per cent decline in Indian agricultural  productivity 22 .  Birthal  et.al  (2021) 23 found  that  heat  stress  harmed  crop yield, which worsened over time. Most studies have suggested that droughts and heat waves negatively impact agricultural productivity compared to floods and cold waves in India. It is, therefore, pertinent to increase the area under irrigation and diversify towards heat and water-resistant crops.

9.19 Between FY16 and FY21, India experienced a significant increase in irrigation area coverage and intensity. The coverage of irrigation area has increased between FY16 and FY21 from 49.3 per cent to 55 per cent of the gross cropped area (GCA), while irrigation intensity has risen from 144.2 per cent to 154.5 per cent. States such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Telangana exhibit high irrigation coverage of their gross cropped area, with figures around 98 per cent, 94 per cent, 84 per cent, and 86 per cent, respectively. In contrast, states like Jharkhand and Assam lag significantly, with irrigation coverage below 20 per cent, underscoring the necessity to improve irrigation

9.20 The government has prioritised irrigation development and water conservation practices  to  enhance  access  to  irrigation  facilities.  Since  the  FY16  fiscal  year,  the government  has  been  implementing  the  Per  Drop  More  Crop  (PDMC)  initiative, a  component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), to promote water  efficiency.  Financial  assistance  is  provided  at  55  per  cent  of  the  total  project cost for small and marginal farmers, and 45 per cent for other farmers for installation of micro irrigation under PDMC. From FY16 to FY25 (end of Dec. 2024), ₹ 21968.75 crore was released to states for implementation of PDMC Scheme and an area of 95.58 lakh ha has been covered under which is about 104.67 per cent higher as compared to the Pre-PDMC period. Further, in addition to PDMC the micro irrigation Fund (MIF)

supports innovatiove projects through 2 per cent interest subvention to states on loans availed  under  MIF.  Loans  amounting  to  ₹4709  crore  has  been  approved  of  which ₹3640 crore has been disbursed so far.

9.21 The  Rain-fed  Area  Development  (RAD)  program  has  been  implemented  to develop  and  conserve  natural  resources  alongside  farming  systems  as  part  of  the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) since FY15. From FY22 onwards, the RAD scheme has been integrated into the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). So far, ₹1,858.41 crore have been allocated, covering an area of 8.00 lakh hectares under the RAD program since its inception.

9.22 According  to  a  study  by  the  A.T.E  Chandra  Foundation,  a  community-led, technology-enabled model for rejuvenating water bodies (RWB) across India can be an important intervention to enhance rural water security. The Composite Land-use Restoration and Assessment Tool (CLART GIS) and the AVNI Gramin app can identify water bodies with potential for groundwater recharge and enable monitoring of such interventions to restore water bodies through geo-tagged images and verification at the  farmer  level.  RWB could, therefore, be a cost-effective  solution  to  India's  water challenges, offering environmental, economic, and social benefits.

## BOX IX.3 :  Micro-Irrigation: Unlocking the potential

Water  scarcity  is  a  challenge  for  Indian  agriculture,  and  promoting  micro-irrigation  is extremely  important  in  reducing  the  water  footprint.  Micro-irrigation  holds  significant potential for India's 140 million hectares of arable land . Even though there is an increase in area under micro-irrigation in India (8 per cent of irrigated area), the pace is still slow as compared to the USA (68.6 per cent) and China (13.7 per cent). 24

<!-- image -->

A study by (Narayanamoorthy et al,2024) 25  examined the impact of drip irrigation on five horticultural  crops-brinjal,  tomato,  banana,  watermelon,  and  mango-in  Tamil  Nadu, India. The study suggested that drip irrigation enhances agricultural outcomes. Compared to flood irrigation, it reduces water consumption by 39-55 per cent and boosts crop yields by 33-41 per cent due to targeted water delivery. This efficiency translates to substantial economic  benefits  for  farmers,  with  profit  margins  increasing  by  52.92-114.50  per  cent depending on the crop (e.g., brinjal, mango). In a similar vein, another study (D. Suresh Kumar et al, 2010) suggested that the drip irrigation method has demonstrated a substantial impact on resource conservation, reduction in cultivation costs, improved crop yields, and enhanced farm profitability 26 .

## AGRICULTURE CREDIT: A critical input

9.23 Providing adequate credit support to all farmers, especially small and marginal farmers  and  vulnerable  sections  of  society,  is  crucial  to  improving  agricultural productivity and income.

<!-- image -->

9.24 The Government of India introduced the Kisan Credit  Card  (KCC)  to  enable farmers to meet their short-term working capital requirements promptly and hasslefree. This has helped enhance the working capital flow to agriculture and allied sectors. As of March 2024, the country has 7.75 crore operational KCC accounts with a loan outstanding of ₹9.81 lakh crore. KCC was further extended to meet the working capital needs  of  fisheries  and  animal  husbandry  in  2018-19,  along  with  the  enhancement

26    Kumar, D. S., &amp; Palanisami, K. (2010). Impact of drip irrigation on farming system: evidence from southern India. Agricultural Economics Research Review, 23(2), 265-272.

of  the limit  for  collateral-free  loans  to  ₹1.6  Lakh.  As  of  31  March  2024,  1.24  lakh KCC and 44.40 lakh KCC were issued to fisheries and animal husbandry activities, respectively.

9.25  In addition to interventions such as the Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS),  which  provides  short-term  agri-loans  through  KCC  for  working  capital requirements at the concessional interest rate of 7 per cent, the Prompt Repayment Incentive (PRI) provides a 3 per cent incentive to farmers who repay on time. Starting from FY25, the claim processing has been digitised through the Kisan Rin Portal for faster and more efficient capturing and settlement of MISS claims.

9.26  To further support small and marginal farmers, banks must allocate 40 per cent of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent Amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (CEOBE), whichever is higher, to priority sectors, including agriculture. All  the  above  measures  have  significantly  reduced  the  reliance  on  non-institutional credit sources from 90 per cent in 1950 to around 25.0 per cent in FY22 27 .

<!-- image -->

9.27 Ground-level credit (GLC) to agriculture has also shown impressive growth with a CAGR of 12.98 per cent from 2014-15 to 2024-25. The GLC has risen from ₹8.45 lakh crore in 2014-15 to ₹25.48 lakh crore in 2023-24. Within this, the share of small and marginal farmers has significantly increased from ₹3.46 lakh crore (41 per cent) to ₹14.39 lakh crore (57 per cent) from 2014-15 to 2023-24.

## BOX IX.4 : Kisan Rin Portal: Streamlining Agri Credit for Farmers' Prosperity

<!-- image -->

The Kisan Rin Portal (KRP) launched in September 2023 addresses key challenges in the Modified Interest Subvention- Kisan Credit Card (MISS-KCC) scheme. Previously, banks had to submit claims for Interest Subvention (IS) and Prompt Repayment Incentive (PRI) manually to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and NABARD, leading to significant delays and inefficiencies. The Kisan Rin Portal digitises this process, ensuring farmers and lending institutions  benefit  from  quicker,  seamless  transactions,  improving  access  to  credit  for agricultural needs.

- Empowering Farmers with Seamless Access to Credit: The portal simplifies the process, enabling access to low-cost credit not only for traditional cropping activities but also for dairy, poultry, fisheries, and beekeeping.
- Benefiting  Financial  Institutions:  Banks  and  Cooperatives: With  the  portal, banks  can  submit  automated  digital  claims,  streamlining  the  entire  process.  This  not only improves efficiency but also helps banks track and manage claims more effectively, facilitating prompt disbursal of benefits.
- Reaching the Grassroots: Training and Support: The KRP's impact extends to over 453 banks nationwide, with 1.89 lakh branches and 4.65 lakh users actively involved in processing claims.
- Current Success and Achievements: By 31 December 2024, it had processed claims worth  ₹108336.78  crore  including  Interest  Subvention  (IS)  and  PRI.  About  5.9  crore farmers that are currently getting benefitted under the MISS-KCC scheme, have been mapped through KRP.

9.28 The government also provides insurance for farmers through the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). This scheme acts as a safety net for farmers against crop losses  due  to  natural  calamities,  pests,  and  diseases.  As  the  largest  crop  insurance program in the world in terms of farmer enrolment and the third-largest by premiums, PMFBY  offers  comprehensive  risk  coverage  from  the  pre-sowing  to  post-harvest stages. By ensuring financial stability, the scheme encourages farmers to adopt modern agricultural practices and technologies, ultimately enhancing agricultural productivity and  food  security.  In  response  to  recommendations  from  various  committees,  the scheme has recently launched several technological interventions, such as YES-TECH, WINDS, and CROPIC 28 . These advancements have increased transparency within the scheme ecosystem by minimizing human intervention and fostering greater trust among stakeholders,  including  implementing  States/UTs  and  and  insurance  companies.  The participation of State governments and insurers has increased to 24 and 15, respectively, in  FY25,  up  from  20  and  11  in  the  2020-21.  Additionally,  these  interventions  have contributed to a 32 per cent reduction in premium rates compared to previous years. As a result, in the FY24 period, the number of enrolled farmers reached 4 crore, a 26 per cent increase from 3.17 crore in the FY23 period. The insured area also expanded to 600 lakh hectares in FY24, reflecting a 19 per cent rise from 500 lakh hectares in FY23. Both the acreage and farmer enrolment figures under the scheme are at an all-time high.

## AGRICULTURE MECHANISATION: Facilitating access

9.29 The  high  machinery  cost  presents  a  significant  barrier  to  promoting  farm mechanisation among small and marginal farmers. Custom hiring arrangements can enhance these farmers' adoption of farm mechanisation, particularly in regions where mechanisation is currently limited. The Sub-Mission on Agricultural Mechanisation (SMAM)  supports  state  governments  with  training  and  demonstrations  related  to agricultural machinery, in establishing Custom Hiring Centres (CHCs), and assisting farmers  in  acquiring  various  farming  equipment.  Further,  farm  machinery  banks enable  the  renting  of  machinery  at  affordable  rates,  thereby  promoting  access  to high-tech machinery for small and marginal farm holdings in areas with low levels of mechanisation. As of 31 December, 26,662 CHCs were established under this initiative, with 138 CHCs set up in the year FY25 alone.

9.30 Furthermore, the government has promoted a recently approved scheme aimed at  providing drones to Women SHGs. This initiative targets 15000 selected Women SHGs to offer rental services to farmers for agricultural purposes, including for the application of fertilisers and pesticides. Central financial assistance of 80 percent of the drone's cost and related ancillary charges, up to a maximum of ₹8 lakh, will be granted to  the  women  SHGs  for  drone  purchases.  This  scheme  will  also  deliver  sustainable business and livelihood support to the SHGs, enabling them to generate an additional income of at least ₹1 lakh per annum.

28    Weather Information and Network Data Systems (WINDS), Yield Estimation System based on Technology (YESTech), Collection of Real Time Observations and Photographs of Crops (CROPIC) provide real time data on weather, yield and uploading full size photos of crops.

## AGRICULTURE EXTENSION: The Enabler

9.31 Agricultural extension is vital in disseminating knowledge, enhancing productivity,  and  promoting  sustainable  agricultural  practices.  The  government is  implementing  the  Sub-Mission  on  Agricultural  Extension  (SMAE)  to  bolster agricultural extension services, enhance entrepreneurship and improve productivity in the agricultural sector throughout India. A key component of the SMAE is the support provided by the Agricultural Technology Management Agency (ATMA), which focuses on  sharing  the  latest  agricultural  technologies  to  boost  production.  The  initiatives include farmer training, demonstrations, exposure visits, kisan melas, mobilisation of farmer groups, and the establishment of farm schools. During the FY24 period, over 3.66 million farmers benefitted from these extension activities, with an additional 4.49 million having availed themselves of these benefits by November 2024. Furthermore, the government has launched the short duration skill training of rural youth scheme to offer short-term skill training to rural youth and farmers in agriculture and related fields. So far, 20940 candidates were trained as of November 2024 of which 5504 were trained in FY25. To address the training needs of middle-level field extension workers, the government has established four regional extension education institutes located in  Haryana, Telangana, Gujarat, and Assam. During FY24, 8,175 extension workers underwent training, with an additional 2,195 trained by November 2024. In addition to training programs, the government operates the Kisan Call Centre to address farmers' queries regarding agriculture and allied sectors. Responses to these queries are provided in 22 official languages from 17 locations nationwide.

## IMPROVEMENT IN AGRICULTURE MARKETING INFRASTRUCTURE

9.32 The government has started several programs to encourage private investment in agricultural marketing infrastructure. One such initiative is the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme, introduced in 2014. It provides capital subsidies to individuals, farmers, and cooperatives to develop storage infrastructure. The AMI is a capital investment program that is open-ended, demand-driven, credit-linked, and features a back-ended subsidy mechanism.

9.33 Under this sub-scheme, a subsidy of 25 per cent is granted for projects in the plains, while projects in the North-Eastern, hilly, and other specified regions, as well as those led by women, SC/ST promoters, and FPOs, can receive a subsidy of 33.33 per cent. The subsidies support the establishment of a range of agricultural marketing infrastructure  projects,  including  storage  facilities,  rural  haats,  common  facilitation centres for FPOs, market yard infrastructure, direct marketing facilities, mobile postharvest 29 operations, cold storage facilities, and integrated value chain projects up to the primary processing stage.

29    Mobile post-harvest systems are portable solutions for processing, storing, and handling agricultural produce near harvest sites to reduce losses and maintain quality.

9.34 As  of  October  31,  2024,  48611  storage  infrastructure  projects  have  been sanctioned, with ₹4,795.47 crore disbursed in subsidies. In addition, 21004 projects related  to  other  types  of  infrastructure  assisted  under  the  AMI  scheme  have  been sanctioned, amounting to a subsidy of ₹2,125.76 crore.

## BOX IX.5 : Empowering Farmers: The Success Story of MAHAFPC

Maha Farmers Producer Company Limited (MAHAFPC), a state-level producer company in Maharashtra, has empowered 646 FPOs to procure and sell agricultural products, including pulses  and  perishable  items.  It  has  helped  farmers  by  providing  multiple  procurement centres,  reducing  transportation  costs,  and  ensuring  timely  payment  at  MSP.  In  2022, MAHAFPC became Maharashtra's largest procurement channel, benefiting over 1.7 lakh farmers.  The  company  has  also  assisted  FPOs  in  developing  infrastructure  like  storage facilities and processing units. By connecting FPOs with private players and using digital technology,  MAHAFPC  has  created  employment  opportunities  and  strengthened  the agricultural value chain 30 .

9.35 Another scheme is the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund (AIF) launched in 2020 to  boost  farm-gate  infrastructure  further  and  improve  private  sector  involvement. This  fund  provides  medium-term  debt  financing  for  post-harvest  management  and community farming projects, offering interest subvention and credit guarantees and supporting various projects such as custom hiring centres, processing units, warehouses, and cold storage facilities.

## BOX IX.6 : Innovative Ways of Land Leasing - Case of Kerala

The Model Agricultural Land Leasing Act, 2016, introduced by NITI Aayog, is a model law aimed at legalising and facilitating the leasing of agricultural land in India. The objective is to improve land access for landless and marginal farmers and provide them with various benefits  and  protections  while  safeguarding  the  rights  and  interests  of  landowners.  The states  of  Andhra  Pradesh  and  Odisha  have  attempted  to  introduce  some  forms  of  land leasing. However, the state government of Kerala has created an innovative arrangement for land leasing. Under this, women or men's SHG groups lease land for more than 3 years for horticulture cultivation. This agreement is made under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, in which the lessee offers agriculture as a service to the landlord and shares profits or pays fixed compensation. The Gram Panchayat (GP) becomes a party to the transaction, and the agreement is notarised in the GP. This helps the lessee group become eligible for benefits like credit and insurance. Since the agreement lasts 3 to 5 years, it is well-suited for cultivating horticulture crops. It also encourages the lessee to maintain and nurture the quality of the land, with findings indicating an increase in farm efficiency in terms of input-output ratio in the case of group leased land compared to owned and self-cultivated land and individually leased land in Kerala possibly due to better convergence achieved with central and state government  support  for  group  farming  activities.  The  initiative  has  also  improved  land access for the poor, as more than 85 per cent of the members are under the low-income category.

9.36 To enhance efficiency in agricultural marketing and improve price discovery, the government has introduced the e-NAM Scheme. This initiative provides free software and  financial  assistance  of  ₹75  lakh  per  Agricultural  Produce  Market  Committee (APMC)  Mandi  for  essential  hardware,  which  includes  quality  assaying  equipment and the development of infrastructure for cleaning, grading, sorting, and packaging. Additionally,  to  support  FPOs  and  empower  farmers,  the  government  launched  a scheme in 2020 with a budget of ₹6,860 crore. As of October 31, 2024, over 1.78 crore farmers and 2.62 lakh traders have registered on the e-NAM portal. As of the same date, 9,204 FPOs have been registered, and 4,490 of these organisations have received equity grants amounting to ₹237 crore.

## CLIMATE ACTION IN AGRICULTURE

9.37 The NMSA is recognised as one of the nine missions within the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). The NMSA has identified key climate adaptation strategies, including enhancing water efficiency, managing soil health and nutrients, providing crop insurance, offering credit support, strengthening value chains, delivering  agro-advisories,  promoting  farm  mechanisation,  managing  agricultural waste,  developing  integrated  farming  systems,  and  supporting  organic  and  natural farming  practices.  It  also  emphasises  climate-resilient  varieties,  livestock,  and  fish culture, promoting these initiatives through various government schemes.

9.38 To support organic farming, the government has implemented two dedicated schemes since 2015: the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and the Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER). Under PKVY,  52,289  clusters  covering  14.99  lakh  hectares  and  25.30  lakh  farmers  have been  mobilised.  Similarly,  under  MOVCDNER,  434  Farmer  Producer  Companies have been created, covering a total area of 1.73 lakh hectares and benefiting 2.19 lakh farmers.

## BOX IX.7 : Spatial mapping of agricultural sustainability

A Composite Index of Agricultural Sustainability was calculated by ICAR using 51 indicators related to environmental health, soil and water quality, and socioeconomic development. The  average  estimated  value  of  the  Index  is  0.49,  suggesting  that  Indian  agriculture  is moderately sustainable. States like  Mizoram, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, West Bengal, and Uttarakhand perform better than the national average.

In  contrast,  arid  Rajasthan  has  the  least  sustainable  agricultural  practices.  According to  the  report,  the  states  with  higher  sustainability  scores  have  experienced  sizable  crop diversification,  improvement  in  agriculture  infrastructure,  farm  credit  and  sustainable input usage. States in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, and Haryana, as well as rice-dominant states like Jharkhand and Assam, are at a higher risk of climate change impacts.

## ALLIED SECTORS: Potential to Build Resilience

9.39 The livestock sector has emerged as a significant engine of growth in agriculture, playing a vital role in the overall agricultural landscape. This importance is underscored by  a  remarkable  increase  in  its  contribution  to  the  Gross  Value  Added  (GVA)  of agriculture and related sectors, which surged from 24.38 per cent in the fiscal year FY15 to an impressive 30.23 per cent by FY23. In the latter year, the livestock sector alone represented 5.5 per cent of the total GVA, reflecting its dynamic growth trajectory, with a robust CAGR of 12.99 per cent.

9.40 The economic significance of this sector is clearly illustrated by its escalating output  value,  which  reached  an  astounding  17.25  lakh  crore  rupees  (equivalent  to US$205.81  billion)  in  FY23.  Among  the  various  branches  of  livestock  production, the milk industry stands out, generating over ₹11.16 lakh crore (US$133.16 billion) in revenue. This figure highlights the sector's vitality and reveals its dominance, eclipsing the  aggregate  production  value  of  staple  crops  like  paddy  and  wheat.  The  livestock

sector is thus not just a contributor to the economy; it is a cornerstone of agricultural prosperity and food security, propelling the rural economy and livelihoods along the way.

9.41    The  government has supported the sector through various initiatives by recognising the growing importance of the livestock sector and its potential to boost farm incomes. The  interventions  include  the  Rashtriya  Gokul  Mission  for  the  development  and conservation of indigenous bovine breeds, the Livestock Health and Disease Control Program to enhance the well-being of livestock, the promotion of IVF technology and sex-sorted semen production to increase the productivity of female cows and initiatives to encourage the formation and growth of FPOs and SHGs to strengthen the sector. Further, the mechanism of Multipurpose AI Technicians in Rural India (MAITRIs) has been established to deliver breeding inputs to farmers' doorstep. In the last 4 years, 38736 MAITRIs have been inducted under Rashtriya Gokul Mission.

9.42 The government has implemented several initiatives to enhance the fisheries sector's  production  and  productivity  over  the  past  decade.  The  Pradhan  Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) was established to boost aquaculture productivity and  improve  fisheries  management.  Additionally,  the  Fisheries  and  Aquaculture Infrastructure Development Fund (FIDF) was introduced to provide financial support for  developing  infrastructure  in  both  marine  and  inland  fisheries.  Other  supportive measures  include  the  establishment  of  fishing  harbours  and  fish  landing  centres, the  adoption  of  innovative  production  technologies  such  as  cages 31 ,  Recirculating

31  Cages are netted enclosures in water bodies like lakes or rivers, allowing water flow while containing fish.

Aquaculture Systems (RAS) 32 , bio flocs 33 , pens 34 , and raceways 35 , as well as initiatives focused  on  transforming  waste  into  wealth  through  the  expansion  of  saline  water aquaculture, and the growth of freshwater fisheries, cold water fisheries, ornamental fisheries, and pearl cultivation. Significant investment has also been made in marketing and transportation infrastructure, along with the development of cold storage facilities.

- 9.43 Due  to  these  initiatives,  total  fish  production  (both  inland  and  marine)  has surged to 184.02 lakh tonnes in FY 23, up from 95.79 lakh tonnes in FY14. Furthermore, India's seafood exports have risen from ₹46,662.85 crore in FY-20 to ₹60523.89 crore in 2023-24, reflecting a growth of 29.70 per cent.
- 9.44 Under the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Kisan Samridhi Sah-Yojana (PM-MKSSY), the National Fisheries Digital Platform (NFDP) was launched, successfully mobilising and registering 16.35 lakh fish producers, workers, vendors, and processors within a short timeframe of just four months.

## COOPERATIVE SOCIETIES:  Strengthening the Institution to serve better

- 9.45 Cooperative  societies  in  India  serve  a  vital  function  across  many  sectors, including  agriculture,  credit  and  banking,  housing,  and  women's  welfare.  These societies are essential in promoting financial inclusion, particularly by extending credit to farmers and small entrepreneurs who frequently encounter barriers when accessing conventional banking services.
- 9.46 To strengthen the cooperative sector, the Indian government has implemented various  strategic  initiatives.  These  include  the  introduction  of  Model  Bye-Laws specifically  for  Primary  Agricultural  Credit  Societies  (PACS),  designed  to  provide a  structured  framework  for  their  operations.  Additionally,  the  government  has prioritised the computerisation of PACS to enhance efficiency and transparency. There is also an ongoing effort to establish new multipurpose PACS and dedicated dairy and fishery cooperatives, which serve diverse community needs. Another key focus is the transformation of PACS into Common Service Centres (CSCs), which are intended to provide services beyond financial assistance.
- 9.47 Other noteworthy measures aimed at enriching the cooperative landscape include the establishment of retail petrol and diesel outlets and the setting up of micro-ATMs within cooperative societies to facilitate easier access to banking services. Moreover, the issuance of RuPay Kisan Credit Cards specifically for dairy cooperatives aims to improve the financial capabilities of these entities and their members.
- 9.48 The  achievements  of  these  initiatives  are  significant.  Over  9,000  new  PACS, dairy,  and  fishery  cooperatives  in  underserved  panchayats  have  been  established,

32  RAS uses tanks to grow fish while continuously filtering and reusing water.

33    Biofloc systems use microorganisms (bacteria, algae) to convert organic waste, uneaten feed, and excreta into protein-rich feed directly in the water.

34    Pens are netted enclosures in natural water bodies, restricting fish to a specific area while allowing water exchange.

35    Raceways  are  narrow  channels  with  continuous  one-way  water  flow,  supplying  oxygen  and  removing  waste efficiently.

receiving  support  from  various  federations.  As  part  of  the  government's  push  for greater accessibility, 240 PACS have applied for retail petrol and diesel outlets, with 39 currently selected to operate, thus expanding their service offerings. Furthermore, a substantial number-35,293 PACS-are now functioning as Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samriddhi Kendras (PMKSK), which are dedicated to providing essential  fertilisers and related services to farmers, directly impacting agricultural productivity. Further, 1,723 micro-ATMs have been distributed, facilitating doorstep financial services and enhancing accessibility for rural populations.

## FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES: Critical for the Economy

9.49 The food processing industry in India is one of the largest  employers  within organised  manufacturing,  accounting  for  12.41  per  cent  of  total  employment  in  the organised sector. In the fiscal year FY24, the value of agri-food exports, which includes processed food exports, reached USD 46.44 billion, constituting roughly 11.7 per cent of India's total exports. Notably, the share of processed food exports within agri-food exports has risen from 14.9 per cent in FY18 to 23.4 per cent in FY24.

9.50 To  foster  growth  in  the  food  processing  sector,  the  Indian  government  has initiated several key programs, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY). This scheme focuses on developing modern infrastructure and optimising supply  chains  from  farm  to  retail.  By  minimising  post-harvest  losses,  increasing processing  capabilities,  and  enhancing  export  levels,  PMKSY  aims  to  promote  the overall  advancement  of  the  food  processing  industry.  As  of  31  October  2024,  1,079 PMKSY projects have been completed.

9.51 The  Production  Linked  Incentive  Scheme  for  Food  Processing  (PLISFPI), launched in 2021, seeks to cultivate globally competitive food processing leaders by facilitating branding and marketing initiatives in international markets. By 31 October 2024,  171  applications  had  been  approved  under  this  scheme,  with  beneficiaries investing ₹8,910 crore and receiving ₹1,084.01 crore in incentives.

9.52 Furthermore, to provide comprehensive support-including technical, financial, and business assistance for establishing or upgrading micro food processing enterprises-the Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME)  scheme  was  launched  in  2020.  As  of  31  October  2024,  the  scheme  has received 407,819 applications, with loans totalling ₹8.63 thousand crore sanctioned to 108,580 applicants. Additionally, the programme has successfully trained 672 Master Trainers, 1,120 District Level Trainers, and 87,477 beneficiaries across 36 states and union territories.

## FOOD MANAGEMENT: Enabling Food Security

9.53 The basic concept of food security is to ensure that there is access to basic food for their active and healthy lives. It is characterised by the availability, access, utilisation, and stability of food supply. While the government has long tackled household food

security through the Public Distribution System (PDS) and Targeted PDS (TPDS), the National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013 and the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) marked a fundamental shift in the approach to food security. That is transitioning from a welfare-based to a rights-based approach. NFSA act legally entitles up to 75 per cent of the rural population and up to 50 per cent of the urban population to  receive  foodgrain,  free  of  cost,  under  the  Targeted  Public  Distribution  System, which, as per Census 2011, comes to 81.35 crore persons. Therefore, about two-thirds of the population is covered under the Act to receive highly subsidised food grains. In addition, PMGKAY was introduced to alleviate the suffering of the poor and vulnerable caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The allocation of free food grain under PMGKAY is in addition to the regular allocation for around 80 crore beneficiaries. The provision of free food grains under PMGKAY for another five years, with effect from 1st January 2024, reflects the long-term commitment and vision of the Government for addressing National food and nutrition security.

9.54 To enhance the efficiency of the Public Distribution System (PDS), the government is fully committed to achieving 100 per cent e-KYC compliance nationwide. This aligns with  the  One  Nation,  One  Ration  Card  (ONORC)  scheme,  allowing  beneficiaries  to complete electronic know your customer e-KYC anywhere, regardless of their home state. Beneficiaries can authenticate their Aadhaar biometrics at any Fair Price Shop (FPS), making it especially convenient for migrant workers to access their entitlements. To facilitate post-harvest lending for farmers, especially small and marginal farmers, the government has approved the Credit Guarantee Scheme for electronic-negotiable warehouse receipt (e-NWR)-based Pledge Financing (CGS-NPF). Under this scheme, farmers  can  obtain  loans  against  e-NWRs  issued  for  agricultural  and  horticultural commodities stored in accredited warehouses. The scheme covers the loss incurred by the bank due to credit and warehouseman risk. The scheme will help in increasing postharvest lending against e-NWRs and thereby play a role in improving farmers' income.

## BOX IX.8 : Measures to support foodgrain storage infrastructure in the country

-     To  support and upgrade the storage infrastructure for foodgrains and to ramp up the storage capacity in India, steel silos are being created in PPP.
-     The government is creating capacity under Hub and Spoke Model Silos, where 'Hub' silos have a dedicated railway siding and container depot facility. While the transportation from 'Spoke' Silos to 'Hub' Silos is undertaken by road, transportation from Hub to Hub is via rail.
-     To  improve  food  grain  storage,  especially  in  hilly  and  remote  areas,  the  government is exploring the use of Flospan, a type of Mobile Storage Unit (MSU), in collaboration with the World Food Programme (WFP). These units can be quickly erected and have a storage capacity of 400 metric tonnes. As a pilot project, WFP has installed Flospan in six states: Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, Mizoram, Uttarakhand, and Chhattisgarh.
-     To modernise government grain warehouses, the government partnered with WFP and IGMRI to pilot a 'Smart Warehouse'. This warehouse uses sensors to monitor temperature, humidity, airflow, and rodent activity, providing real-time data to improve storage and reduce losses.

## CONCLUSION

9.55 India's agricultural sector, despite encountering various challenges, remains a crucial pillar for economic growth and ensuring food security for the nation. This sector has consistently demonstrated remarkable resilience, evidenced by stable growth rates supported by a range of government initiatives to enhance productivity, diversify crop portfolios, and provide essential social security support for farmers.

9.56 The increasing significance of allied sectors, such as animal husbandry, dairying, and fisheries, underscores the importance of diversification in activities and sources of income for boosting their income levels and building resilience. By tapping into these complementary  sectors,  farmers  can  create  additional  streams  of  revenue  that  can buffer them against the inherent volatility of traditional crop production.

9.57 However, the  sector  is  not  without  its  challenges.  Issues  like  climate  change and  water  scarcity  present  significant  obstacles  that  require  focused  and  targeted interventions. Promoting agricultural production patterns and practices that align with the  specific  agro-climatic  conditions  and  natural  resource  availabilities  of  different regions across the country is vital. Investment in research and development, especially on climate-resistant varieties, improved agriculture practices, diversification to highyield and climate-resilient crops, and micro-irrigation, can yield sustainable long-term benefits.  The  widespread  adoption  of  digital  technologies  in  agriculture  will  unlock further possibilities for enhancing productivity.

9.58 Improving price discovery and market efficiency is another critical aspect that necessitates attention. Strengthening market infrastructure is essential to facilitate this improvement. This can be achieved by effectively utilising the e-NAM, a platform for farmers to access broader markets. Furthermore, supporting the establishment and operational capabilities of FPOs and enabling cooperatives to play a more active and influential role in agricultural markets is paramount to fostering an inclusive market environment.

9.59 Government initiatives like PM-KISAN, which provides direct income support to farmers, and Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY), which offers pension schemes  for  farmers,  have  successfully  contributed  to  bolstering  farmers'  incomes and enhancing their social security safety nets. More than 11 crore farmers have been benefitted under PM-KISAN and 23.61 lakh farmers had enrolled under PMKMY as of 31st October 2024. In addition to these efforts, reforms such as e-KYC compliance under the ONORC initiative and credit guarantee schemes for e-NWR financing address systemic inefficiencies that have historically plagued the agricultural sector.

9.60 Moreover, there is a concerted focus on modernising food grain storage systems, particularly in remote and hilly areas, which reflects a strong commitment to improving the overall supply chain infrastructure.

9.61 While  various  initiatives  have  helped  India's  agriculture  and  allied  services  to grow under challenging circumstances, the good news is that there is still significant

untapped growth potential. The right set of policies across all levels of government can reduce the overproduction of cereals and address the underproduction of pulses and edible oil. For instance, India's farmers must be allowed to receive price signals from the market unimpeded, with separate mechanisms designed to take care of the cost-ofliving impact on deserving households for specified durations. Two, they need to have market mechanisms to hedge their price risks. Three, they need the right policies that nudge them away from impairing their soil fertility with an unbalanced application of  fertilisers  and  from  producing already overproduced crops, which deplete India's water  resources  and  use  up  electricity  excessively.  These  policy  shifts  will  help  lift agricultural productivity in the economy by boosting land and labour productivity in the sector. Consistent and stable growth of agriculture at around 5 per cent, with a 20 per cent share of overall GVA in the economy, will contribute 1 per cent growth to GVA. Agriculture will then absorb surplus labour even as output per worker and output per hectare rise. Agro-based entrepreneurship will flourish even more than it already does. In the process, India will not only achieve food security for itself but will also enable it for other nations too. The possibilities are both exciting and limitless.
