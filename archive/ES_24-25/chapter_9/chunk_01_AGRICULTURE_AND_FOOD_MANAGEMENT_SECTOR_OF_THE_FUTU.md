India's  agricultural  sector  has  demonstrated  remarkable  resilience  in  recent years,  marked  by  consistent  growth  rates.  This  stability  can  be  largely attributed to various government initiatives to enhance productivity, promote crop diversification, and increase farmers' income. A crucial factor influencing agricultural performance is the impact of weather conditions. Climate variability can  present  significant  challenges;  however,  farmers  with  diverse  income streams are better positioned to navigate these uncertainties. Allied activities such as animal husbandry, fisheries or agroforestry, can enable the farmers to mitigate the risks effectively. Various government initiatives are specifically designed to address these challenges.
