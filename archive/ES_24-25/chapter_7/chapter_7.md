CHAPTER

## INDUSTRY: ALL ABOUT BUSINESS REFORMS

<!-- image -->

The global manufacturing landscape has undergone significant shifts over the past decade. India has been one of the dynamic economies that gained greater presence  in  the  space  gradually  vacated  by  developed  countries.  A  strategic emphasis  on  public  capital  formation  and  significant  logistic  improvements has  underpinned  this  achievement.  Lately,  however,  there  have  been  serious challenges to global manufacturing in terms of persistent geopolitical tensions, aggressive industrial and trade policies, supply chain disruptions, and global trade  slowdown.  This  has  posed  a  challenge  to  export  demand  for  India's manufactured products.

Industries such as steel, cement, chemicals, and petrochemicals have stabilised industrial growth, while consumer-focused sectors like automobiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals have emerged as growth drivers. As we progress,  fostering R&amp;D  investments,  innovations,  enhancing  the  growth  and  formalisation  of smaller manufacturers will drive growth across various sectors.

State-level analysis indicates that business reforms in states are likely to foster industrial  development.  Achieving  India's  ambition  of  becoming  a  strong manufacturing power necessitates sustained and coordinated efforts from all tiers of government, the private sector, the skilling ecosystem, academia and R&amp;D institutions.

## GLOBAL BACKGROUND

7.1 In the global manufacturing space, high-income countries have lost a significant part of their share during the last decade 1 . This was largely gained by the upper middleincome countries, mainly based on China's strength. The share of lower middle-income economies did not, in general, increase. Yet, India managed to improve its share in the pie and global presence.

7.2 However, with 2.8 per cent of the global share in manufacturing, compared to China's  28.8  per  cent,  India  has  a  large  opportunity  to  climb  up  the  ladder 2 (chart VII.1(a)). India also has a substantial scope to improve the contribution of the industrial sector in GDP in relation to its comparator countries (chart VII.2(b)). More so in the

light of the IMF's observation 3   that manufacturing production is increasingly shifting towards emerging market economies, particularly China and India. India stands a good chance of benefitting from the trends in global industrial diversification 4 .

7.3 While this remains an upside of possibility, the downside stems partially from the increasing risks of industrial and trade policy measures by the countries faced with external competition and internal weaknesses. There are also early global indications that,  given  elevated  commodity  price  trends,  consumption  is  tilting  away  from manufactured items and more towards services.

As a result, the global manufacturing output rose modestly by 0.4 per cent only in the third quarter of 2024, compared to a stronger growth of nearly 1 per cent in the previous quarter 6 . Hence, in a rather unsupportive global environment, it calls for lasting, coordinated efforts from all tiers of government, the private sector, the skilling ecosystem, academia and R&amp;D institutions, as well as financial stakeholders to enable India to realise its ambition as a manufacturing powerhouse.

## RECENT DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS

7.5 The  industrial  sector  (including  four  sub-sectors,  i.e.,  mining  and  quarrying; electricity,  gas,  water  supply  and  utilities;  manufacturing  and  construction)  was affected significantly by the pandemic, leading to a contraction in FY21. This led to growth fluctuations in subsequent years. Hence, comparing FY25 with an average of the previous five years, including the pre-pandemic FY20, is appropriate. Chart VII.2(a) shows that the industrial growth in FY25 is expected higher than the previous five-year average.  The industrial sector grew by 6.2 per cent in FY25, driven by robust growth in electricity and construction.

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;

7.6 However, industrial growth has declined to 3.6 per cent in the second quarter (Q2) of FY25 on account of three major factors.  Firstly, manufacturing exports experienced a sharp slowdown due to economic challenges in destination countries and intensified trade  competition  and  industrial  policies  followed  by  many  major  trading  nations. Secondly,  the  unprecedented  levels  of  monsoon  produced  mixed  impacts.  While  it helped replenish reservoirs and boost farming operations, it also slowed down activities like mining, construction and, to an extent, manufacturing. Thirdly, the variation in the timing of festivals between September and October in the previous and current years contributed to a slight statistical downward bias in the growth figures for Q2 as festivals drive higher consumer spending and economic activity. Festival sales of select consumer items, including automobiles, picked up in October.

7.7 The  remaining  sections  of  the  chapter  are  organised  as  follows.  The  next  two sections review the progress, challenges, and policy measures across various industrial segments, including core industrial input industries and capital and consumer goods sectors.  This is followed by a brief discussion on over-arching themes like research and development and micro, small and medium enterprises. The state-level variations in the degree of industrialisation and the scope for progress are examined in the following section. The last section concludes the discussions and presents a way ahead.

## CORE INPUT INDUSTRIES

## Cement

7.8 Currently, India is the second largest cement producer in the world after China 7 . The Indian cement industry comprises 159 integrated large cement plants, 128 grinding units, five clinkerization units and 62 mini cement plants. The current annual installed capacity of the cement industry is about 639 million tonnes, with cement production of around 427 million tonnes in FY24. Most of the cement plants in India are located in proximity to the raw material source. About 87 per cent of the cement industry is concentrated  in  the  States  of  Rajasthan,  Andhra  Pradesh,  Telangana,  Karnataka, Madhya  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Tamil  Nadu,  Maharashtra,  Uttar  Pradesh,  Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Meghalaya and West Bengal. The industry has adequate capacity to meet the domestic cement demand. Domestic cement consumption is around 290 kg per capita

against a global average of 540 kilograms per capita. The government's focus on mega projects like highways, railways, and housing schemes, coupled with rural development and industrial growth, is expected to fuel significant cement demand.

7.9 The cement industry carries an environmental footprint. The industry has been actively working to reduce its carbon emissions of cement by 2070.

## Steel Industry

7.10 In April-November of FY25, the country's crude steel and finished steel production registered a growth of 3.3 per cent and 4.6 per cent. There has been an overall upward trend in steel production and consumption during April-November FY25 despite some month-on-month fluctuations.

7.11  The sustained growth in steel sector was fuelled by ongoing development projects and  increased  public  infrastructure  spending.  The  primary  drivers  of  steel  demand included  expansion  in  end-user  sectors  and  the  implementation  of  policies  like  the National Steel Policy and Production-Linked Incentive schemes. Government initiatives on housing, urban and rural infrastructure also contributed to the rising demand 9 .

7.12   Driven  by  an  infrastructure-focused  growth  strategy,  steel  demand  in  India is  expanding  at  a  strong  pace.  This  growth  is  further  bolstered  by  significant advancements  in  key  user  industries,  particularly  building  &amp;  construction,  and infrastructure. In FY24,  construction, and infrastructure accounted for an estimated 68 per cent of total steel consumption, followed by engineering and packaging at 22 per cent and automobiles at nine per cent. India has been a net importer of steel from April to November FY25. The decline in India's export of finished steel during FY25 was mainly driven by gaps between international and domestic prices. The low price in the international market during this period resulted in a low margin on exports and cheaper imports.

7.13    The  government's Steel's Scrap Recycling Policy encourages efficient recycling of scrap. The total domestic consumption of steel scrap in India is approximately 30 Million  Tonnes  (MT),  of  which  around  5  MT  is  imported.  Ensuring  the  availability of high-quality scrap in sufficient quantities is crucial for transitioning to green steel and supporting the future growth of the steel industry. In addition, the use of scrap significantly reduces specific energy consumption. It also reduces the water consumption by 40 per cent, and greenhouse gas emissions by 58 per cent 10 .

## Chemical and Petrochemical Sector

7.14 The share of chemicals and chemical products sector in the GVA of manufacturing sector (at 2011-12 prices) was 9.5 per cent during FY23. The country is a net importer of these products, with a dependence on imports of around 45 per cent of petrochemical intermediates 11 .  Reducing  the  gap  between  domestic  demand  and  supply  is  a  high priority.

## PERFORMANCE OF CAPITAL GOODS AND CONSUMER GOODS INDUSTRIES

## Capital goods

7.15    The  production  of  capital  goods  fluctuated  between  FY20  and  FY23,  before recording a robust growth in FY24. Yet, the growing reliance on the import of such goods poses a challenge. Due to technology gaps, this sector imports the high-end machines required for manufacturing. There is an urgent need to address the technology, skill and  infrastructure  gaps.  The  government  has  notified  phase  II  of  the  Scheme  for Enhancement of Competitiveness of the Capital Goods Sector. The objective of Phase II of the Scheme is to expand and enlarge the impact created by its Phase I. Phase II of the scheme promotes identification of technologies through technology innovation portals,  setting  up  of  new  advanced  centres  of  excellence  and  common  engineering facility centres among others for enhancing the global competitiveness of capital goods sector.

7.16  The government has been actively promoting Smart Manufacturing and Industry 4.0,  supporting  the  establishment  of  Smart  Advanced  Manufacturing  and  Rapid Transformation Hub (SAMARTH) Udyog centres at various institutions. These centres aim to foster an ecosystem where manufacturing industries, especially SMEs, can learn about and adopt new technologies.

## Automobile Industry

7.17  The Indian automobile industry is a significant driver of economic growth, offering a diverse range of domestically produced vehicles. In FY24, the industry recorded auto mobile domestic sales growth of 12.5 per cent. Recognising the sector's potential, the government has extended the PLI Scheme by one year.

## Electronics Industry

7.18 India's  electronics  sector  has  been  dynamic  regarding  domestic  production, exports and imports in the last decade. The domestic production of electronic goods has  increased  substantially  from  ₹1.90  lakh  crore  in  FY15  to  ₹9.52  lakh  crore  in FY24, growing at a CAGR of 17.5 per cent. The country has also drastically reduced its dependence on smartphone imports, with 99 per cent now manufactured domestically. In FY24, the country produced approximately 33 crore mobile phone units, with over 75 per cent of the models being 5G enabled. The key drivers of growth have been the large domestic market, the availability of skilled talent, and low-cost labour.

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; Source: Data provided by Industry Associations &amp; Directorate General of Commercial Intelligence and Statistics (DGCI&amp;S)

7.19  Programmes  such  as  Make  in  India  and  Digital  India,  along  with  improved infrastructure, ease of doing business, and various incentives, have boosted domestic manufacturing and drawn foreign investments. However, India's electronics market represents 4 per cent of the global market. The industry has largely focused on assembly, with limited progress in design and component manufacturing.

## BOX-VII.1: Empowering India's Domestic Manufacturing in Electronics Sector Through Production-linked Incentives

The  PLI  scheme  has  been  introduced  in  14  key  sectors  including  electronics.  The  PLI scheme adopts a sector-specific  approach,  avoiding  a  "one  size  fits  all"  methodology.  In the electronics sector. PLI aims to scale up assembly processes to encourage the existing domestic manufacturing ecosystem. The results are evident: in FY15, mobile phone imports accounted for 78 per cent of the market in value terms, whereas, by FY23 this figure had dropped to just 4 per cent. In terms of volume, only 0.8 per cent of mobile phones were imported in FY23. Exports tell a similar story. Mobile phone exports, valued at zero in FY16, soared to ₹88,726 crore in FY23. Similarly, in the white goods sector, the scheme seeks to boost domestic value addition, targeting an increase from 15-20 per cent to 75-80 per cent  12 .

The  3rd  Round  of  on-line  application  window  for  PLI  Scheme  for  White  Goods  (Air Conditioners and LED lights) attracted 38 responses. 43 per cent of the new applicants are in the MSME sector which shows the confidence among MSMEs to become part of the value chain of manufacturing of components of ACs and LED Lights. 13

According to FICCI, the support of the PLI scheme, encouraging local production of the key components like compressor, heat exchangers, motors, controllers etc., triggered the development of a complete value chain for key AC components. As the annual size of room AC market has grown considerably in recent years, the import dependency for compressors has reduced. Local capacities for heat exchangers, cross flow fans and controller PCBAs also improved. The PLI scheme has fostered collaboration across various industry layers. Suppliers of  raw  materials,  component  manufacturers,  and  producers  of  finished  goods,  including multinational corporations and local brands, as well as MSMEs, have aligned their requirements.

## Textiles

7.20  The textile industry is a major employment generator and it accounts for about 11 per cent of India's manufacturing GVA. India is a leading producer of jute and ranks second globally in cotton, silk, and man-made fibre production. India is the sixth largest exporter of textiles and apparel and has a share of about 4 per cent of the global trade in this segment. The share of textiles and apparel, including handicrafts, in India's total merchandise exports stood at about 8 per cent in FY24.

<!-- image -->

7.21  After having recorded a high of USD 44.44 billion in FY22, India's export of textiles and apparel, including handicrafts, stood at USD 35.87 billion in the FY24, compared to export of USD 36.69 billion in FY23. India is looking to diversify its export market to other regions. India has traditionally focused on cotton textiles. Globally, manmade fibre (MMF) consumption is dominant. Hence, in order to move towards a higher global MMF share, it is essential to simultaneously focus on MMF along with cotton textiles.

7.22  Technical textiles are another area of potential growth 14 . India's technical textile industry  is  rapidly  growing,  ranking  fifth  globally.  Indian  technical  textiles  market stands at US$26.8 billion in FY24 15 . India is a net exporter of technical textiles, with exports valuing US$2.58 billion in FY24. To assist the technical textiles manufacturing ecosystem, the government has introduced several initiatives, including the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. To ensure quality and standardisation of the technical textiles, 68 items have been brought under regulation through quality control order in various segments.

7.23  Despite possessing a complete value chain, textiles face several challenges. The dominance of MSMEs limits scale and efficiency, while its fragmented nature increases logistical costs. India's reliance on cotton, unlike the global shift towards MMF, limits its competitiveness in the worldwide market. The sector has attracted limited foreign direct  investment,  hindering  technological  advancements  and  reliance  on  imported textile machinery. A significant skill gap persists, hindering productivity and innovation. Addressing these challenges is crucial for India to realise its full potential as a global textile powerhouse.

## Pharmaceuticals

7.24   The  Indian  pharmaceutical  industry  is  the  world's  third-largest  by  volume. The industry boasts of a diverse product portfolio encompassing generic drugs, bulk drugs, over-the-counter medications, vaccines, biosimilars, and biologics, establishing a  strong  global  presence.  The  total  output  of  the  pharmaceuticals,  medicinal  and botanical products industry in FY23, at constant prices, reached ₹4.56 lakh crore, with a value-added of ₹1.76 lakh crore 16 .  The total annual turnover of pharmaceuticals in FY24 was ₹4.17 lakh crore, growing at an average rate of 10.1 per cent in the last five years. Exports account for 50 per cent of the total turnover, with its value at ₹2.19 lakh crore in FY24. The total import of pharmaceuticals was worth about ₹58,440.4 crore. The government has taken various measures to support the sector like PLI scheme and Strengthening of Pharmaceuticals Industry (SPI) among others. PLI scheme aims to attain self-reliance and reduce import dependence in critical Key Starting Materials (KSMs)/Drug  Intermediates  and  Active  Pharmaceutical  Ingredients  (APIs).  SPI addresses the demand to support the existing pharma clusters and MSMEs across the country to improve their productivity, quality and sustainability.

7.25 The medical devices industry in India is experiencing rapid growth, with a CAGR of approximately 15 per cent. Currently, India holds an estimated 1.5 per cent share of the global medical devices market. Within Asia, India ranks fourth in terms of market size, following Japan, China, and South Korea. On a global scale, India is recognised as one of the top twenty medical device markets.

7.26   As  noted  by  UNIDO,  among  the  top  5  pharmaceutical  producers,  the  United States led the way with a robust 4.7 per cent quarter-over-quarter growth in Q3 2024. Following the US were Japan at 1.4 per cent and China at 0.9 per cent. In contrast, Switzerland experienced a decline of -2.1 per cent, and India saw a slight decrease of -1.2 per cent.

7.27   India  is  making  significant  strides  in  the  area  of  cell  and  gene  therapy.  In October  2023,  the  Central  Drugs  Standard  Control  Organisation  approved  India's first indigenously developed CAR-T cell therapy. To expedite the availability of newer drugs,  such  as  gene  therapy  products,  orphan  drugs,  drugs  representing  significant therapeutic advantage, in the country, the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation under the rule 101 of the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019, has notified the United States of America, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Canada and the European Union, enabling waiver of local clinical trial for new drugs that are already approved and marketed in the notified countries. The overall pharma landscape of India points towards a need to focus on innovation, new drug development and biopharmaceuticals, as R&amp;D spending still lags behind global leaders.

## FLOURISHING INNOVATIONS AMIDST ASPIRATIONS OF ENHANCED R&amp;D

7.28  India has a robust intellectual property ecosystem. As per the WIPO Report 2022, India ranks sixth among the top 10 patent filing offices globally. Patent applications are largely in computer &amp; electronics, mechanical &amp; biomedical, and communication fields.  Since  the  National  IPR  Policy  2016,  amendments to rules governing patents, designs,  copyrights,  and  trademarks  have  streamlined  application  processes  and reduced  compliance.  The  Patent  (Amendment)  Rules  2024  has  further  simplified patent processing, filing and maintenance.

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; 7.29  The government has also implemented several other initiatives to encourage IP protection. Some of them include:

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;

- GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; · Expedited patent examination for start-ups, SMEs, women inventors, government departments, and academic institutions.
- GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; · Simplified  patent  procedures:  The  government  has  simplified  the  disclosure requirements  for  patent  working  and  foreign  filings,  reduced  the  timeline  for examination from 48 months to 31 months, introduced certificates of inventorship, and provided a grace period for prior disclosed inventions.
- GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; · Simplified trademark procedures: The number of trademark forms has been reduced from 74 to 8, streamlining the trademark registration.
- Fee  reduction:  Significant  fee  reductions  have  been  implemented  for  start-ups, MSMEs, and educational institutions for patent, design, and trademark filings.
- Digitalization: The adoption of virtual hearings, AI/ML-based search systems, and secure VPN connections have improved efficiency, accuracy, and decision-making in IP processes.
- Start-Up Intellectual Property Protection Scheme: It provides financial and technical assistance  to  start-ups  in  filing  and  processing  patent,  design,  and  trademark applications, which has been extended till March 2026.
- IP  Saarthi  Chatbot:  offers  instant  support  and  guidance  to  users  regarding  IP registration and grant processes.
- Technology Transfer Organizations for promoting R&amp;D and IP commercialisation by  providing  services  to  innovators  and  entrepreneurs.  The  government  has established 34 Technology and Innovation Support Centres across the country to facilitate these efforts.

7.30  These measures have made the IP eco-system more efficient and prolific, helping India  emerge  as  a  global  IP  leader  (Box-VII.2),  ranking  in  the  top  10  for  patents, trademarks, and industrial designs.

## BOX-VII.2: India's Innovation Landscape: Major Milestones…

- There is a more than 2-fold increase in patent filing since 2014-15, and patent grants have increased by more than 17-fold from 2014-15.
- There is a marked growth in resident filings which increased to more than 50 per cent of the total filings in FY24 from 28 per cent in FY15.
- The patent filings by domestic educational institutes have tripled from 7405 in 2021-22 to 23306 in FY24.
- Patent filings by women applicants increased from 15 in FY15 to 5183 in FY24.
-  India's rank in the Global Innovation Index has improved to 39th in 2024 among 133 economies from 81st position in 2015.  It ranks 1st among the 38 lower middle-income group economies and 1st among the 10 economies in Central and Southern Asia 17 .
- India  holds  the  7th  position  in  intangible  asset  intensity,  surpassing  the  growth  rates of  many  high-income  economies  and  matching  the  intangible  investment  intensity  of Germany and Japan (as a share of GDP). 18
-  India holds 4th position in Science and Technology Cluster Ranking 2024 by WIPO with 4 cities among the world's top 100 science and technology clusters 19 .

Nonetheless, the Global Innovation Report 2024 notes that India needs to enhance human capital,  improve  access  to  finance  and,  reduce  regulatory  burdens  further  and  improve infrastructure for innovation ecosystem.

7.31    While  the  focus  on  frugal  innovations,  abundance  of  scientific  manpower, strength of IT, pharma industry, vibrant start-up eco-system, and policy support have fostered innovations, India lags in R&amp;D, with a significant gap across major sectors. The gross expenditure on research &amp; development (GERD) in India has increased from approximately ₹60,196 crore in FY11 to about ₹127,381 crore in FY21 20 . However, this is 0.64 per cent of the GDP, which is insufficient and remains low compared to many countries that have forged ahead in R&amp;D.

7.32  While government R&amp;D policies and interventions have been making sustained efforts, there is a need for more contribution from the private sector. The funding for R&amp;D in India is predominantly sourced from government entities.

<!-- image -->

7.33   In  contrast,  in  most  developed  and  emerging  economies,  business  enterprises contribute over 50 per cent to the GERD. In countries like China, Japan, South Korea, and the USA, this share exceeds 70 per cent 21 . In the USA, the private sector leads, with  companies  like  Google  and  Amazon  accounting  for  about  70  per  cent  of  R&amp;D spending 22 . China, on the other hand, has a combination of major government funding with rising private sector involvement, leading to R&amp;D spending of about 2.1 per cent of its GDP 23 .

## BOX-VII.3: R&amp;D Incentives: A Global Comparison

R&amp;D-related incentive systems vary across countries, yet there are common threads. China's strategy  is  characterised  by  significant  government  intervention.  Key  incentives  include substantial tax breaks, such as super deductions and reduced corporate income tax rates. Preferential treatment is given for innovative products and services and various financial incentives and subsidies, especially in designated economic zones. South Korea focuses on targeted R&amp;D investment with tax credits for investments in strategic technologies and new growth sectors and emphasising investment in tangible assets. The US approach relies more on market-based mechanisms and tax incentives. Key incentives include non-refundable tax credits and research credits with tax incentives for R&amp;D investments in designated zones.

In  addition,  there  are  no  specific  geographic  requirements  for  IP  location  or  designated innovation zones 24 .

In  India,  incentives  like  grants,  loans,  tax  exemptions,  patent-related  incentives  etc.  are given for R&amp;D. In addition to these incentives, initiatives like Start-Up India, Digital India, and the Atal Innovation Mission have been introduced to foster entrepreneurship, research, and technological advancement. To provide financial support to industries, the government has  also  created  the  Technology  Development  Board.  Many  state  governments  provide stamp duty waivers and concessions, and soft loans 25 .

26    EY Worldwide Research and Development Incentives Reference Guide 2024 (*note: Not the exhaustive list of R&amp;D incentives).

7.34   In India, not only is the industrial R&amp;D low, but it is also sectorally concentrated. Drugs  and  pharmaceuticals  led the way, followed by information technology, transportation, defence, and biotechnology.  Public sector R&amp;D is primarily driven by the defence industry, followed by the fuels and metallurgical sectors.

7.35  Historically, India's R&amp;D focus has been on basic research rather than applied research. This often lacks the practical applications needed to attract private investment (DST, 2020). This gap needs to be bridged to streamline and drive innovations and investment  across  multiple  sectors.  To  bridge  this  gap,  we  need  to  foster  industryacademia  collaboration,  enhance  private-sector  participation,  and  prioritise  applied research. And the private sector needs to respond to the R&amp;D challenge wholeheartedly.

7.36  The MSME sector is important to India's progress. By fostering entrepreneurship and creating a large number of jobs at relatively low capital costs, the sector plays a crucial role, second only to agriculture. As of November 26, 2024, MSMEs have reported employing 23.24 crore individuals.

7.37   In  order  to  simplify  the  process  of  registering  MSMEs  and  to  enable  ease  of doing business the government launched the Udyam Registration Portal in July 2020. This  online,  self-declaration-based  system  requires  a  PAN  card  for  registration.  To formalize Informal Micro Enterprises (IMEs), the government in collaboration with SIDBI, introduced the Udyam Assist Platform (UAP) in January 2023. Over 2.39 crore informal micro enterprises have been formalized through the platform, making them eligible for priority sector lending benefits.

7.38  To facilitate credit to MSMEs, a revamp of the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) was undertaken with ₹9,000 crore in the corpus of the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for MSEs. This aimed to facilitate an additional ₹2 lakh crore credit for MSEs at reduced interest rates. Consequent to this, the credit limit for guarantee coverage under the scheme was enhanced from ₹2 crore to ₹5 crore, and the annual guarantee fees across all segments were reduced by 50 per cent. In FY23, 11.65  lakh  guarantees  amounting to ₹1 lakh crore were given. The government also made special provisions for IMEs under the existing credit guarantee to avail credit easily.

## BOX VII.4: TReDS: Transforming MSME Financing Through Timely Payments

The  launch  of  TReDS  has  been  an  important  step  taken  by  Government  of  India  for benefitting the MSMEs and helping them realize their receivables in a time-bound manner at  a  relatively  lower  financing  cost.  TReDS,  regulated  by  the  RBI,  is  a  marketplace  that enables buyers such as government departments, public sector undertakings, corporates etc. to honour timely payments to their MSME suppliers as per MSMED Act 2006.

TReDS 27   offers  several  notable  benefits  for  MSMEs,  including  post-shipment  financing without  recourse,  which  is  based  on  the  buyer's  creditworthiness.  The  platform  employs an auction-based mechanism that ensures competitive rates from financiers. Further, the seamless digital financing and settlement process, enabled through the National Payments Corporation of India, enhances efficiency and transparency in transactions.The Governments of Goa and Tamil Nadu have set an example by adopting the TReDS platform to ensure timely

payments to their MSME suppliers. Goa, heavily reliant on tourism, leveraged TReDS during the  COVID-19 disruption to enhance supplier liquidity, facilitating payments for over 250 MSMEs since October 2020, with invoice discounts. Tamil Nadu joined TReDS in 2022 under the Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP) program, supporting MSMEs in significant numbers. Their proactive adoption has inspired other states to follow suit.

Several  central  public  sector  enterprises  and  government  entities  have  been  using  the TReDS platform since its inception to facilitate timely payments to MSME suppliers. Active participants like BHEL, NTPC, ONGC, BPCL, HPCL, IOCL and others help MSMEs maintain their working capital cycles while enabling them to benefit from lower interest rates.

In addition to CPSEs, corporates with a turnover exceeding ₹500 crore have been utilising TReDS for prompt payments to their suppliers. With the Government of India's mandate for companies with a turnover above ₹250 crore to join the platform, more corporates are expected to onboard. TReDS also fosters strong relationships between corporates and their suppliers by ensuring swift payments, eliminating the need for MSMEs to chase their buyers for payments. If more government bodies, ministries, state governments, and corporates adopt receivables discounting on platforms like TReDS, it could significantly transform the MSME financing landscape.

7.39  To provide equity funding to MSMEs with the potential to scale up, the government launched the Self-Reliant India (SRI) Fund with a corpus of ₹50,000 crore.  The fund has a provision of ₹10,000 crore from the government and ₹40,000 crore through private equity/venture capital funds. In addition to providing easy credit, the government is committed to addressing MSMEs' issues through measures like MSME Samadhan and the  CHAMPIONS  (Creation  and  Harmonious  Application  of  Modern  Processes  for Increasing the Output and National Strength) portal.

7.40   To  deal  with  the  issues  of  delayed  payments,  MSE  suppliers  may  approach  the Micro  and  Small  Enterprises  Facilitation  Council  (MSEFC).  The  government  also launched a portal that gives information about individual CPSEs, central ministries, state governments, and other buyers regarding the payments pending with them in respect of  the  MSEs.  The  portal  also  facilitates  MSEs  to  file  their  delayed  payment-related complaints online. From the date of launch of the MSME SAMADHAAN portal 2,20,704 applications have been filed by MSEs, out of which 20652 have been mutually settled, 53493 are yet to be viewed by MSEFC, 60714 have been rejected, 45952 cases have been disposed off and 39893 cases are under consideration. 28  As of date, the CHAMPIONS portal disseminates information in eleven regional languages.

7.41    The  government  is  implementing  the  Micro  and  Small  Enterprises-Cluster Development Programme (MSE-CDP) to develop clusters across the country. Under this, Common Facility Centres (CFCs) are channels to address common issues, such as improvement of technology, skills, quality, etc., for MSEs. As per the report of the evaluation  study  of  MSE-CDP  conducted  by  the  National  Productivity  Council,  the

scheme has been able to improve the efficiency of the value chain of the units in the cluster, resulting in overall productivity growth of around 10-15 per cent and growth in turnover in the range of 20-30 per cent 29 .

## APPROPRIATE POLICIES LIKELY TO BRING IN GREATER EQUITY IN STATE-WISE PATTERNS IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION

7.42   Developmental  disparities  across  States  have  always  been  a  matter  of  keen attention, bringing convergence of per capita incomes and living standards to policy focus.  However,  convergence  does  not  mean  convergence  in  every  sector,  because different states will have comparative advantages in different sectors-be it dairying &amp; farming, manufacturing, conventional or medical tourism, software, financial sector or any other activity. Coastal states can do better in industrialisation and exports.

7.43   Even  while  recognising  this,  the  Survey  presents  inter-state  differences  in industrialisation in this Chapter.  Disparities in  service  sector  developments  are presented  in  Chapter  8.  As  shown  by  the  national  account  statistics,  in  FY23  about 84.7 per cent of GVA (at constant prices 2011-12) in the country is generated by industrial and service activities together, with an inter-state 30 variation (chart VII.16) 31 . And hence, sustained improvements in productivity and growth in one or more service or industrial sectors is inescapable for overall development of states. This is true of even states that have an advantage in agricultural activities. This is because, dynamic industrial and service sectors can help to move and productively employ the surplus manpower in agriculture, apart from generating additional intermediate and final demand for farm output.

7.44   Four  states-the  western  states  of  Gujarat  and  Maharashtra  and  the  southern states  of  Karnataka  and  Tamil  Nadu-  account  for  about  43  per  cent  of  the  total industrial GSVA. (In this section, industrial GSVA refers to the year FY23 at constant 2011-12 prices; population refers to figures used by the respective State Directorates of  Economics &amp; Statistics for their GSDP calculations). In contrast, six states of the Northeast (excluding Sikkim and Assam), account for only 0.7 per cent of the industrial GVA. There is a need for focus on industrial strategies appropriate to unique geographies like the North East.

7.45  In chart VII.17, states are placed and colour-coded in three categories based on their position relative to the overall average in the share of industrial and its component GVA (FY23 at constant prices). States with industrial share higher/lower by 25 per cent of  the  national  average  are  'Green'  and  'Red'  respectively.  States  around  the  overall average are yellow. The intent is to only understand whether there is a fairly balanced pattern in the share of industry and its components in the overall GSVA of each State. However, as observed in para 7.43, the observed patterns reflect, to a great extent, the

comparative advantages of States. 32  There is no strong conspicuous regional pattern visible in terms of industrial dependence, except to an extent in the Eastern region.

(*) Note: All State average of the share of industrial GVA is 33.2 per cent; mining: 2.8 per cent; manufacturing: 19 per cent; electricity: 2.5 per cent; and, construction: 8.9 per cent. The shares are in constant prices. The all-State average may not match with the national average.

7.46   High level of dependence on industrial sectors does not necessarily reflect high level of industrial development. Thus, concealed within the state shares are the variations in per capita industrial GSVA. The chart VII.18 presents four quadrants demarcated by the all-state average in the share of industrial sector in State's total GVA and their

per capita industrial GSVA. There are clear patterns in the degree of industrialisation emerging from chart VII.18. Only a few States like Gujarat, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh  are  able  to  cash  on  their  high  level  of  dependence  on  industrial  sector  to generate reasonable levels of incomes for their people. Chart VII.18 also shows that few states have high levels of dependence on industrial sector with low income generation while states in eastern and northern region are least industrialised.

7.47    Construction activity, closely linked with infrastructure development, urbanization and real  estate  trends,  also  shows  inter-state  differences.  At  one  extreme,  Kerala  is comparatively less industrial than many other States (chart VII.18), but it is a positive outlier in construction activity (chart VII.19), with construction contributing about half of its industrial GVA.

7.48  The industrial patterns shown by many States reflect their comparative advantages. However, as shown by charts VII.18 &amp; VII.19, in the case of many States, it signifies dependence  on  relatively  low  income  generating  industrial  activities,  hampering movement of surplus labour in agriculture and structural transformation.

7.49  The mining sector contributes about 8 per cent to the total industrial output. On expected lines, the mining activity is highly concentrated with top five states that is Assam, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Odisha, accounting for about 60 per cent of the all-State mining GSVA.

7.50   Ramaswamy  (2019) 33 ,  in  his  study  on  concentration  of  manufacturing  units and  workers  across  states,  suggested  that  among  States,  there  was  no  decline  in concentration in the registered sector but there was a decline in concentration in the unregistered sector. Data from Annual Survey of Industries for FY23 for the factory sector and the data on unincorporated manufacturing enterprises (from ASUSE Survey for FY23) show vast inter-State disparities in the number of factories/enterprises per person in different states (chart VII.20). Among the bigger states, Tamil Nadu leads the pack with the highest concentration of factories per person, followed by Gujarat. Bihar hardly has any factories, while Uttar Pradesh hardly has any smaller enterprises.

7.51   The very weak relation between the state-wise patterns in factories per person and  unincorporated  manufacturing  establishments  per  person  indicates  that  some States low in the factory sector activity have considerable presence of unincorporated enterprises. It is an opportunity for those States to recognise, nurture and increase the durability and scales of their smaller enterprises, with appropriate policy facilitation and deregulation.

7.52  Research papers that examine the factors affecting industrial progress in States, highlighted that state-level policies play a crucial role in shaping the economic growth patterns  across  Indian  states  (IMF,  2006) 34 .    Another  early  study  (Debnarayan  et al.,  2011) 35     suggested that Indian states that implemented significant economic and administrative  reforms  during  the  reform  period  reaped  the  benefits  of  industrial expansion.  Factors  like  regulatory  environment,  infrastructure  development,  and state-level  reforms  are  shown  to  significantly  influence  industrial  growth  patterns. Shiladitya  Chatterjee  (2022) 36 shows  that  the  state  level  industrial  growth  drivers are infrastructure, human development and policy and institutional environment for industrial development.

7.53   The  Business  Reform  Action  Plan  (BRAP)  formulated  by  the  Department  for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade aims to assess and enhance the ease of doing business across states. As per the BRAP 2020, states are categorised into four groups in terms of ease of doing business, i.e., top achievers, achievers, aspirers and emerging business eco-systems. Chart VII.21 shows a positive correspondence between business reforms and the level of industrial activity, suggesting the need for deregulation and enterprise-friendly reforms in aspiring and emerging states 37 .

## BOX-VII.5: Tamil Nadu's Strategic Initiatives to Foster Footwear Manufacturing Growth

Tamil Nadu is a leader in the traditional leather sector and now championing the growth of non-leather footwear. The state contributes to 38 per cent share in India's footwear and leather  products  output,  contributing  to  about  47  per  cent  share  in  India's  total  leather export. This sector generates more than 2 lakh employment. Tamil Nadu (TN) also houses technical  and  academic  institutions  like  Central  Leather  Research  Institute,  Council  for Leather Exports, Footwear Design and Development Institute.

Some of the major initiatives taken by Tamil Nadu Government to attract large footwear manufacturers in the recent years are listed below:

- The State has focused on developing industrial estates in rural areas to ensure access to a ready workforce, particularly women. These efforts have attracted foreign investors, such as Feng Tey from Taiwan, who set up contract manufacturing for Nike.
- It  has  identified  land  in  districts  like  Madurai  and  Sivagangai  for  future  footwear investments, ensuring land availability for potential manufacturers.
-  TN's investment promotion agency, namely, Guidance, has made concerted investment promotion activities. Guidance actively liaised with Taiwanese agencies to strengthen ties with  potential  investors  in  footwear  sector.  Guidance  established  contacts  with  major contract  manufacturers  of  Nike  like  Pou  Chen,  Hong  Fu,  Taekwang  and  Changshin, positioning Tamil Nadu as an attractive destination for manufacturing.

- The  External  Engagement  Cell  in  Guidance  prepares  publicity  material  in  foreign languages like Mandarin, Japanese and Korean; it is now being prepared in German and French as well for smooth communication.
- A  dedicated  investment  facilitator  is  assigned  to  each  investor.  The  entire  clearance process and operational issues after commencement of production are managed through this single point of contact. This has enhanced the reputation of TN as an investment friendly state.
- The  agency  has  a  division  called  WorkLabs  which  is  a  dedicated  industry-academia coordination cell to actively engage industry in curriculum reform and familiarise new companies entering Tamil Nadu with the talent ecosystem of the State.
- It has also appointed regional officers for various parts of the State, who are based in Tier II towns like Madurai, Coimbatore and Tirunelveli.
- The incentive package system offered in Tamil Nadu is flexible and can be tailored to the needs of each investor. Tamil Nadu offers a range of incentives such as capital subsidies, payroll subsidies, and land cost subsidies. The state has launched a dedicated Footwear and Leather Products Policy 2022, which aims to develop a comprehensive ecosystem that supports both large manufacturers and smaller enterprises.

7.54  There is a close connection between industrial and service sectors, as indicated by the increasing 'servicification' of industrial output and exports. 38 Goldar et al. (2017) also indicated that services inputs contribute significantly to export intensity of Indian manufacturing firms. Hence, it is important that States focus on business reforms on a priority basis so as to achieve buoyancies in some industrial or service sectors where it  has  natural  advantages. States should make it easier for businesses to commence operations,  to  grow  and  even  be  closed,  if  deemed  inevitable  by  the  entrepreneur. Allowing economic activity as far as possible and getting out of the way will foster faster convergence of living standards and per capita incomes. The route taken by different states will be different and will necessarily have to be so.

## CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

7.55  Economic Survey 2023-24, released in July 2024, reported that:

- i.    Over the last decade, output shares were realigned among industrial segments in favour of sectors like chemicals, wood products and furniture, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, steel and machinery and equipment.
- ii.    Import dependency in key sectors like coal, capital goods and chemicals continues. Global uncertainties may constrain export demand and affect the domestic cost of production by influencing the prices of import-intensive raw materials.

- iii.    The  path  to  further  industrialisation  is  paved  with  deregulation,  R&amp;D  and, innovation and improving the skill levels of the workforce. Commitment to R&amp;D must be in the DNA of the industry, independent of any fiscal incentive since it is about global competitiveness and profitability.
- iv.    Sectors with widely scattered production units, like textiles, and the MSME sector in general, seek support systems to develop projects and ensure finance, easier compliance, and grassroots-level facilitation to ensure market access.

7.56  The foregoing analysis supports and reinforces these conclusions and suggestions, particularly strongly in the following respects.

- i.    The  first  is  the  connection  between  the  uncertain  and  unsupportive  global environment  and  the  Indian  industry.  There  was  a  manufacturing  growth deceleration in H1 FY25. A part of it was due to seasonal causes like the alignment of  festivities  and  monsoon-related  disturbances.  Slackening  global  trade  and aggressive trade and industrial policies of many major economies have affected manufacturing and investment by the private sector. However, business surveys and purchasing managers' index point to improving optimism. The way ahead lies in vigorous focus on deregulation, R&amp;D, appropriate skilling and employment strategies, and targeted support for smaller enterprises.  This will improve the competitiveness of the Indian industry and prepare it to weather global challenges.
- ii.    The brief State-wise analysis presented in this Chapter reveals that they are vastly different in their industrial strengths, weaknesses and accomplishments. It also highlighted that the state of business regulations and reforms varied across States, and these differences are closely related to their industrial progress or the lack of it. This reiterates the need for appropriate business reforms at the grassroots level.

7.57  Hence, as noted in the Chapter, in a rather unsupportive global environment, it calls for lasting, synchronised efforts of all tiers of governments, the private sector, the skilling eco-system, academia and R&amp;D institutions, as well, and financial stakeholders to enable India realise its ambition as a manufacturing powerhouse.
