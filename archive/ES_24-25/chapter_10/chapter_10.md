## CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENT: ADAPTATION MATTERS

CHAPTER

India  needs  to  achieve  robust  economic  growth  to  attain  developed  nation status by 2047, with a focus on inclusive and sustainable development. While the country has low per capita carbon emissions, it is committed to pursuing low-carbon  growth.  However,  it  faces  challenges  in  deploying  renewable energy, particularly due to a lack of storage technology and access to minerals. Given  India's  vulnerability  to  climate  change,  a  strong  adaptation  strategy is  essential;  the  increase  in  adaptation  expenditures  from  3.7  per  cent  to  5.6 per cent of GDP between FY16 and FY22 indicates the prominence adaptation and  building  resilience  play  in  the  development  strategy.  The  Lifestyle  for Environment (LiFE) initiative, designed to encourage sustainable practices and circular economy, will play a transformative role in the development process. The flow of international finance has remained grossly inadequate, with much of the action being financed from domestic resources. The outcomes from the recent CoP29 hold little promise on that account.

## INTRODUCTION

10.1  India's  ambition  to  achieve  developed  nation  status  by  2047  is  fundamentally anchored in the vision of inclusive and sustainable development. Notably, India's per capita carbon emissions are one-third of the global average, even as it stands among the world's fastest-growing economies. The country is dedicated to identifying and exploring pathways for low-carbon development that simultaneously ensure affordable energy security, job creation, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. However, India's  aspiration  for  low-carbon  economic  growth  presents  significant  trade-offs. While the nation has made remarkable progress in building renewable energy capacity, effectively harnessing and scaling these resources remains challenging due to the lack of viable storage technologies and limited access to essential minerals.

10.2   A  strong  adaptation  strategy  is  a  priority  for  the  country,  given  its  significant vulnerability  to  climate  change,  stemming  from  its  geographic  and  agro-climatic diversity. 1  India's Initial Adaptation Communication, submitted to the United Nations

Framework  Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  in  December  2023,  reveals that the total expenditure related to adaptation in FY22 was 5.6 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), an increase from 3.7 per cent in FY16. Climate action, so far, has been financed through domestic resources, with the public sector playing a central role. On the other hand, the international flow of funds for climate actions is highly inadequate and has a mitigation bias (Chart 1).

10.3 Following a low-carbon development pathway and achieving the net zero carbon emissions  goal  necessitates  a  fundamental  shift  in  mindset  and  behaviour  towards mindful consumption and production. The India-led global movement, Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE), aims to enhance the country's sustainability efforts. The LiFE initiatives  are  being  executed  in  India  in  mission  mode  through  various  regulatory measures and policies that encourage environmentally friendly practices such as waste management, resource conservation, and recycling. Promoting a circular economy is also envisioned as a central component under the Mission LiFE.

10.4 The recent outcome of the New Collective Quantified Goal at CoP29 (29th session of the annual climate conference under the UNFCCC) held in Baku in November 2024 on  finance  presents  little  optimism  about  the  possibility  of  support  to  developing countries. With  the  developed  countries  also falling short of their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by about 38 per cent, 2  their actions do not reflect the historical responsibility or the leadership in meeting their obligations. The lack of commitment and insufficient delivery of the means of implementation, 3  as mandated in the Paris Agreement, will make the low-carbon transition in developing countries more challenging.

3  Finance, Technology and Capacity Building are regarded as the means of implementation.

10.5 The 29th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 29) and the 6th Session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement (CMA 6), held in Baku, Azerbaijan, were designated as the 'Finance COP'. The focus was to establish the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance. 4  The meetings of COP29 and CMA6 presented a significant opportunity to serve as a benchmark for international climate cooperation and multilateralism, with the potential to influence the efficacy of climate policies on a global scale and strengthen collaborative efforts by enhancing the financial commitments to support climate action in developing countries.

10.6 Establishing a small mobilisation target of USD 300 billion annually by 2035 is a fraction of the estimated requirement of USD 5.1 - 6.8 trillion by 2030. 5 It is out of sync with the needs of the critical decade when action is required to keep the temperature goals  of  the  Paris  Agreement  within  reach. 6 The  decision  demonstrates  a  significant misalignment with the Paris Agreement's mandate to demonstrate a 'progression beyond previous  efforts'  by  developed  countries.  It  underscores  the  unwillingness  of  affluent developed nations to assume their equitable share of the responsibility to address emission reduction and mitigate climate change impacts on vulnerable populations in developing regions. The goal contravenes equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in the global climate response by disproportionately placing the burdens of climate change on those nations that have not historically contributed to the crisis.

10.7 COP 30 in 2025 is the COP for Climate Action, before which the parties to the Paris Agreement are to submit their next version of Nationally Determined Contributions. The  funding  shortfall  may  lead  to  a  reworking  of  the  climate  targets.  Considering that domestic resources will be the key to action, resources for meeting development challenges  may  be  affected,  undermining  progress  toward  sustainable  development objectives and compromising the integrity of international climate partnerships.

10.8 This  chapter  is  structured  into  three  broad  parts.  It  starts  with  discussing  the importance of adaptation for India and the measures taken, focuses on energy transition and  the  lessons  learnt  from  the  experience  of  the  developed  countries  and  weighs options for India. It ends with an overview of the Lifestyle for Environment (LiFE) initiative and measures encouraging sustainable practices and circular economy.

## BRINGING ADAPTATION TO THE FOREFRONT

10.9 India is the seventh most vulnerable country to climate change. 7  It suffers from weather extremes and hazards, slow onset events such as sea-level rise, biodiversity loss, and water insecurity. While greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a global bad and the benefits of mitigation are diffused, vulnerable developing countries such as India have to bear a disproportionate burden of climate change and have no choice but to face the climate change consequence of historical emissions. The emissions remain with us. They impose huge costs on already resource-constrained countries. Hence, vulnerable developing countries such as India need to undertake climate adaptation on an urgent footing as this has a direct impact on lives, livelihoods and the economy.

10.10  The  Ministry  of  Environment,  Forest  and  Climate  Change  (MoEFCC)  has initiated the process of developing the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The NAP is a vital strategic document articulating India's adaptation priorities. The process aims to develop a comprehensive and inclusive NAP that aligns with sustainable development goals and ensures climate resilience for all regions and sectors. This is in addition to the Initial Adaptation Communication submitted to the UNFCCC on 9 December 2023, highlighting the country's adaptation priorities, strategies, policies, and programmes along with implementation support needs for adaptation action.

10.11 Implementing  effective  adaptation  strategies  will  necessitate  a  multi-faceted approach  that  includes  policy  initiatives,  sector-specific  strategies,  development  of resilient  infrastructure,  research  and  development,  and  securing  financial  resources for adaptation efforts. Furthermore, these adaptation measures should be tailored to regional specificities, given India's significant diversity of geographic and agro-climatic conditions. The following subsections discuss the initiatives to build resilience across sectors.

## Adaptation in agriculture

10.12 Heat and water stress can negatively impact yields, posing challenges for India's food security. Adaptation strategies in agriculture have included enhanced focus on research and development of climate-resilient seeds, measures to preserve and enhance groundwater resources,  improve  soil  health,  and  modify  cropping  practices,  among other measures. The chapter on Agriculture and Food Management discusses measures to improve adaptation in agriculture in detail.

## Building resilience in urban areas

10.13 With  increasing  urbanisation  and  climate  change  impacts,  comprehensive adaptation action to address heat stress, urban flooding, and depleting groundwater in

7   Global Climate Risk Index. (2021). The 10 most affected countries in 2019. Table 1. Page 8. Retrieved December 27, 2024, from https://www.germanwatch.org/en/19777.

cities has been gaining focus. The National Mission on Sustainable Habitat (NMSH), launched in 2010, one of the nine missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change  (NAPCC),  seeks  to  promote  low-carbon  urban  development  and  bolster resilience  against  climate  change  impacts  through  five  key  thematic  areas:  waste management, water management, energy and green building, mobility and air quality, and urban planning, green cover, and biodiversity. In 2015, sustainable development and climate actions became integral to urban investments through various missions and programs. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has introduced a  unique  assessment  framework  for  cities  to  evaluate  climate-relevant  parameters, helping them adopt and share best practices. This framework aligns with international standards for green, sustainable, and disaster-resilient urban habitats, enabling Indian cities to promote sustainable urban development. 8

10.14 The  Atal  Mission  for  Rejuvenation  and  Urban  Transformation  (AMRUT)  is benefiting  citizens  by  improving  water  supply  systems,  augmenting  localised  water resources through the revitalisation of water bodies, enhancing groundwater recharge, increasing permeable green spaces, promoting the recycling and reuse of wastewater, and  implementing  energy  efficiency  reforms,  thus,  promoting  key  thematic  areas under the NMSH. As of December 2024, 785 stormwater drainage projects have been completed, eliminating 3,631 waterlogging points and constructing 1,380 kilometres of  drains  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  urban  flooding.  Work  is  currently  underway  to address an additional 285 waterlogging points. Additionally, 2,438 parks have been developed, contributing 5,070 acres of green space. Over 320 green mobility projects have been completed to encourage environmentally friendly modes of transport and infrastructure, creating 493 kilometres of walkways and cycle tracks.

10.15 AMRUT 2.0 9   aims to enhance ease of living by creating water-secure cities through water conservation, augmentation and rejuvenation. As of December 2024, 3,078 water body rejuvenation projects have been approved with the planned rejuvenation of 475 square kilometres area with 4.65 crore million litres per day (MLD) capacity, of which nine  water  rejuvenation  projects  have  been  completed.  These  projects  are  focused on sewer diversion/ treatment before discharge into water bodies, sustainability and emphasis on nature-based solutions. AMRUT 2.0 also focuses on the reuse of water and greywater management. As of December 2024, 1,437 MLD capacity has been developed for recycling/reuse.

## BOX-X.1  Vertical Gardens and Environment Sustainability

Rapid urbanisation has intensified environmental challenges, including the urban heat island effect, increasing carbon emissions, and heightened air pollution. A promising solution gaining traction is the concept of vertical gardens, also called living walls or vertical greenery systems  (VGS).  These  systems  incorporate  vegetation  into  vertical  structures,  effectively addressing  these  issues.  By  transforming  urban  facades  into  vibrant  green  landscapes, vertical gardens enhance the aesthetic appeal of buildings and contribute to environmental sustainability-improving thermal performance, sequestering carbon, and fostering biodiversity in densely populated cities. (Zaid et al., 2018 10 ; Harbiankova &amp; Manso, 2025) 11 .

The practical application of this innovation is the Income Tax Department's initiative to create vertical gardens using over seven lakh waste plastic bottles. This project recycles waste and adorns urban structures across 17 states, showcasing the environmental and aesthetic enhancements vertical gardens can offer. 12

Looking ahead, India's regulatory framework is continuously evolving, exemplified by the introduction  of  the  Energy  Conservation  and  Sustainable  Building  Code  (ECSBC)  2024, which advocates energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable building practices. While this code facilitates the adoption of sustainable designs, there remains an opportunity for further enhancements, such as explicit guidelines for vertical gardens. These additions could significantly improve urban air quality and mitigate heat islands. Such policy advancements would align India with global best practices observed in Singapore, Japan, and the European Union, where vertical greening has become integral to urban development. (Bustami et al., 2018) 13 .

The future  of  urban  planning  in  India  stands  to  gain  immensely  from  embedding  these ecological  considerations  into  building  policies  and  approval  processes,  making  vertical gardens  a  standard  feature  in  the  architectural  landscape.  This  shift  would  ultimately contribute to healthier and more sustainable urban environments.

10.16 The Smart City Mission 14   adopts  a  people-centric  approach  anchored  around liveability,  economic  ability  and  sustainability.  The  Urban  River  Management  Plan (URMP)  aims  to  assist  river  cities  in  reviving  and  maintaining  rivers  sustainably. Launched in 2021, the River Cities Alliance (RCA), a partnership between the Ministry of Jal Shakti and MoHUA, focuses on sustainable river-centric development in more than 145 member cities.

## Adaptation in coastal regions

10.17 India's 7,600 km long coastline and many islands make adaptation in the coastal region particularly important. The coastal regions face extreme climate events (such as heavy rain, severe storms, high tide flooding, etc.), and slow onset events, such as sealevel rise, bring the risk of permanent inundation. Adaptation action in coastal regions can include planting and sustaining mangroves, building sea walls and artificial reefs, beach nourishment, dune planting, sand bypassing, etc.

## BOX-X.2  Mangrove Initiative for Shoreline Habitats &amp; Tangible Incomes (MISHTI)

The  'Mangrove  Initiative  for  Shoreline  Habitats  &amp;  Tangible  Incomes  (MISHTI)'  was introduced in the Union Budget for 2023-24. It aims to promote and conserve mangroves, which  are  unique  natural  ecosystems  known  for  their  high  biological  productivity  and carbon sequestration capabilities. Additionally, mangroves serve as a protective barrier for coastlines against cyclones, typhoons, and tidal waves.

The objective is to restore mangrove forests through reforestation and afforestation measures along India's coast. This will be achieved by adopting the best practices established in India and worldwide, all within a realistic timeline. The aim is to enhance sustainable livelihood options  for  coastal  communities  and  improve  the  support  and  services  the  mangrove ecosystem provides to the community and the economy.

The programme will cover approximately 540 square kilometres across nine coastal states and four UTs over five years (2023-2028). It will create approximately 22.8 million mandays of employment with an estimated carbon sink of 4.5 million tons of carbon, creating potential areas for nature tourism and livelihood potential for local communities.

The programme is being implemented in convergence mode, with funding from the State Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), National CAMPA,  Mahatma  Gandhi  National  Rural  Employment  Guarantee  Act  (MGNREGA) and  other  sources.  State  forest  departments  are  the  primary  implementing  agencies  of the programme. Gap funding to support the core and support activities under MISHTI is through National-CAMPA.

As  of  30  November  2024,  six  states  and  UTs:  Andhra  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Odisha,  West Bengal, Kerala, and Puducherry have been allocated funds under the program. This funding is  intended  to  treat  3,836  hectares  under  the  National  CAMPA  program,  based  on  the annual plans submitted by these states for their first-year activities. Additionally, through collaboration with other initiatives, including State CAMPA, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), and various state-specific programs, a total of 22,560.34 hectares of degraded mangrove areas have been brought under restoration across 13 states and UTs.

10.18  The government of India has undertaken several steps to protect and enhance mangrove  forests  in  coastal  states/union  territories  (UTs)  through  promotional and  regulatory  measures. 15   Promotional  measures  are  implemented  through  the 'Conservation  and  Management  of  Mangroves  and  Coral  Reefs'  scheme  under  the National Coastal Mission Programme. Regulatory measures are implemented through the  Coastal  Regulation  Zone  (CRZ)  Notification  (2019)  under  the  Environment (Protection)  Act,  1986;  the  Wild  Life  (Protection)  Act,  1972;  the  Indian  Forest  Act, 1927; the Biological Diversity Act, 2002; and rules under these acts as amended from time to time.

## BOX-X.3  Enhancing climate resilience of India's coastal communities

The 'Enhancing Climate Resilience of India's Coastal Communities' project aims to enhance the resilience of the lives and livelihoods of the most vulnerable populations, particularly women, and to build resilience to climate change and extreme events, using an ecosystemcentred and community-based approach. The project is being implemented across India's coastal states and UTs.

As of 31 December 2024, approximately 4955.01 hectares of ecosystem has been restored which includes 3259.11 hectares of mangroves and 1695.9 hectares of degraded watershed. It is estimated that approximately 40,617.8 tonnes CO2 eq. have been sequestered under this  project.  An  assessment  of  the  coastal  zone's  cumulative  vulnerability  is  proposed  to facilitate  appropriate  adaptive  measures.  Other  proposed  activities  under  the  project include promoting/demonstrating alternative climate-resilient livelihood options such as establishing mud crab hatcheries, promoting climate-resilient agriculture practices - and systematic rice intensification (SRI) technology for paddy cultivation.

## Adaptation action for water management

10.19 The Jal Shakti Abhiyan was initiated in 2019 to address the acute water stress in various parts of the country. The recent Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch the Rain - 2024, themed  "Nari  Shakti  se  Jal  Shakti'  (9  March  to  30  November  2024),  was  focused on  women's  role  in  water  conservation  through  five  interventions  like  rainwater harvesting,  water  body  mapping,  intensive  afforestation,  and  awareness  generation. The National Aquifer Mapping Project (NAQUIM) has been completed across 25 lakh square kilometres, offering water conservation plans and recharge structures to state agencies for implementation.

10.20  The Bhu-Neer portal, launched in September 2024, is a Central Ground Water Authority  portal  for  managing  and  regulating  groundwater  resources,  promoting transparency,  efficiency  and  sustainability  in  groundwater  usage.  The  FloodWatch India  app  (Version  2.0)  launched  by  the  Central  Water  Commission  provides  realtime flood forecasts and detailed data from 592 flood monitoring stations, along with reservoir storage insights to assist flood management.

10.21 Several  states  have  undertaken  other  initiatives  to  manage  water  resources. The 'Jal Sanchay Jan Bhagidari' initiative, launched in Gujarat in September 2024, focuses  on  constructing  24,800  rainwater  harvesting  structures  across  the  state  to enhance rainwater harvesting and ensure long-term water sustainability. The Smart Laboratory  on  Clean  Rivers  (SLCR),  established  under  the  India-Denmark  Green Strategic  Partnership  in  Varanasi,  aims  to  rejuvenate  the  Varuna  River  through sustainable practices and collaboration among government bodies, institutions, and communities.  The  Mawrah  Multipurpose  Reservoir  Project  of  Meghalaya  in  East Khasi  Hills  district  aims  to  conserve  rainwater,  recharge  groundwater,  rejuvenate springs,  restore  the  catchment  area  and  rehabilitate  mine-spoilt  land.  The  project serves as a model for integrated water resource management and community-driven environmental conservation efforts. The Dhamtari district of Chhattisgarh launched the Jal Jagar campaign focused on rainwater harvesting, rooftop water collection and wastewater management by engaging the community, especially women. It aims to transfer technology to field functionaries and empower communities to make decisions based on scientific data, and financial prudence. Jal Jagar activities were undertaken across  370  gram  panchayats  of  Chhattisgarh,  involving  the  participation  of  80,389 women and 61,580 men.

## ENERGY TRANSITION - LEARNING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND WEIGHING THE OPTIONS

10.22  The first major energy transition from wood to coal began in the early eighteenth century,  coinciding  with  the  advent  of  the  first  industrial  revolution.  Two  centuries later, coal was overtaken by oil and gas around 1946 (O'Connor, 2010), 16  and fossil fuels became the primary energy source (Solomon &amp; Krishna, 2011). 17  The energy transition from wood to coal was motivated by several factors, of which industrialisation in Britain and concerns over the loss of forests due to enhanced logging were pre-dominant (Smil, 2019). 18  A more recent transition from oil to nuclear energy in France that began in the

1970s was driven by the oil embargo by oil-producing countries in 1973 (Solomon &amp; Krishna, 2011) 19  and the intent to reduce dependence on imported oil.

10.23  The energy transitions witnessed till the last century were driven by commercial interests  rather  than  the  will  to  limit  the  emissions  from  advanced  economies. Commercial  interests  and  energy  security  remain  the  most  significant  factors  in the  transition  pathway  even  today.  In  2022,  the  European  Union  introduced  the REPowerEU plan, 20  which aims to reduce dependence on Russian gas supplies. The plan includes a budget of € 10 billion allocated for investment in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and an additional € 1.5 to 2 billion designated for securing oil supplies. The European Union further amended its sustainable taxonomy 21   to include generating power and heat from fossil gaseous fuels as a transitional activity. In 2023, the US administration also approved the onset of the country's largest oil drilling project in the Alaska region, with an estimated total oil and non-gas liquids production of 628.9 million barrels and 260.79 million metric tons of associated indirect carbon dioxide equivalent of emissions. 22 Actions speak louder than words, with the biggest beneficiaries of carbon-intensive growth over several centuries holding on to fossil fuels even as they would want the developing countries to take up the less efficient, costlier and riskier options.

10.24  Recent  data  about  the  G7  countries  (Charts  2  and  3)  for  almost  the  last  six decades (1992 to 2023) shows that these countries continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels in their per capita primary energy consumption, shifting from coal and oil-based energy to gas-based energy.

10.25  The  friction  between  energy  transition  and  energy  security  is  clearly  evident in  the  actions  of  developed  countries,  revealing  the  limitations  of  transitioning  to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. First is the significant 'congestion cost' of managing a complex energy system incorporating fossil fuels and renewables. With the shift to renewable energy, there has also been an increasing trend in electricity prices (Chart 4). The congestion and higher cost have led to instances of wind turbines being curtailed due to grid limitations, necessitating the activation of gas plants to meet peak demand (Will Mathis, 2024) 23 , (Oliver, 2024) 24 . The shift from coal to natural gas as the base load has been the policy choice for ensuring grid stability in the UK and other developed countries. Developed countries have utilised their most abundant fuel in their transition. The transition to renewable energy has been tardy, forcing a return to fossil fuels to ensure stable supply and address rising electricity prices.

10.26  India has growing energy needs. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development also includes a dedicated and stand-alone goal on energy, SDG 7, which calls for countries to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all".

energy mixes and energy efficiency scenarios, Bhattacharyya et al. 2022 26  estimated that the minimum level of per capita final energy requirement for India to become a developed country with an HDI of 0.9 must be in the range of 45.7 to 75 gigajoules per year. As per the Energy Statistics of India 2024, provisional estimates indicate that the total final consumption of energy per capita for FY23 was 16,699 megajoules or 16.7 gigajoules (~approx.), 27  indicating that the gap between actual and required future energy consumption to fuel growth to achieve Viksit Bharat status is quite huge.

10.27  One of the key pillars of SDG7 is the expansion of renewable energy; however, it is clear that even in the most advanced economies, the technologies for renewable energy and their implementation are not yet at a maturity level that allows them to fully replace fossil fuel-based power plants. Several challenges hinder renewable energy's cost-effective and efficient integration into the energy mix. These include significant investments required for grid integration, the development of battery infrastructure to manage intermittency, scaling up production of the components of renewable energy systems, access to critical minerals that are needed for storage technology, the limited availability of land in densely populated areas and the competing and rapidly increasing energy demands from agriculture, infrastructure, and industry.

10.28  Coal has an important role to play in India's sustainable development. 28  Around 88 per cent of the US's coal-fired capacity was built between 1950 and 1990. 29  On the other hand, the United Kingdom, driven by their industrialisation, started very early and their coal-run power plants dominating the energy supply till the late 1970s when natural  gas  was  identified  as  a  reliable  substitute. 30 In  India's  case,  most  capacity additions to the coal-fired power plants were made only in the 2010s. 31 There is no valid economic rationale for shutting down coal plants in India, leaving huge investments underutilised and stranded and without a dependable alternative in place. The US and European countries may transition from coal to natural gas because they have access to

that resource, and their older conventional coal-based thermal plants are nearing the end of their life cycle. Unlike many developed countries, India's only reliable energy source is coal, 32 as it possesses around 10 per cent of the world's coal reserves but only 0.7 per cent of the world's natural gas reserves. 33

10.29  Presently, given the resource endowments, coal cannot be neglected as a reliable and affordable source of energy for India's development. India has, however, taken a leading role in climate action, with the government implementing measures to reduce emissions in the economy. One key strategy has been to promote the efficient use of coal by utilising super-critical (SC), ultra-super-critical (USC) and the recent Advanced Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) technologies in coal-based power plants. Back in 2010, India commissioned its first power unit based on supercritical technology, and by the middle of 2024, a total capacity of 65,290 megawatts (94 Units) and 4,240 megawatts (06 units) in supercritical and ultra-supercritical technology-based power units have been  commissioned  respectively. 34   Further,  more  recently,  the  National  Thermal Power  Corporation  Limited  (NTPC)  and  Bharat  Heavy  Electricals  Limited  (BHEL) have developed an Indigenous Advance Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) technology and are setting up an 800-megawatt AUSC technology-based Thermal Power Plant. This AUSC power plant will reduce emissions by about 11 per cent compared to super-critical plants. 35

10.30  Among the other cleaner sources of energy, nuclear, being an efficient source of energy, has increasingly emerged as a reliable alternative to fossil fuel. However, there are challenges. The expansion of the use of nuclear power has to contend with public concerns about safety and the uncertainty that the latest technologies are controlled by a few countries (Jayanti, 2023). 36  Geographical concentration (Economic Survey, 20222023; 2023-2024) 37  of uranium and other essential minerals also poses a challenge. Besides,  nuclear  energy  relies  heavily  on  the  stability  of  fossil  fuel  supply  chains  to

produce sulfuric acid for uranium extraction (Maslin et al., 2022). 38  By 2040, estimates suggest that a shortfall of sulfuric acid supply could range from 100 million to 320 million tonnes, 39  depending on the extent of efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Furthermore, even in the short run, actions by key players can pose a risk to the growth of the nuclear power sector (Dempsey, 2024). 40  The significance of nuclear energy, given its higher efficiency and low greenhouse gas emissions, requires a forward-looking perspective to address potential challenges in advance, facilitating a smoother transition.

10.31 Further, the challenge of disposing of renewable energy technologies, especially solar panels, reveals how environmental policies can create complex issues. The state of California, a leader in promoting rooftop solar for two decades, did not develop a comprehensive  plan  for  managing  the  end-of-life  of  these  systems  (Kisela,  2022). 41 Disassembling and recycling solar panels is complex and demands highly specialised equipment and skilled workers. Implementing proper waste management strategies for renewable energy systems is imperative, as neglecting to address this issue could lead to significant environmental contamination. Effective disposal methods must be developed  to  manage  by-products  and  materials  associated  with  renewable  energy technologies to mitigate potential negative impacts on ecosystems and public health.

## BOX-X.4  New Emission Sources: Are they being accounted for?

The demand for electricity in the United States is projected to increase significantly 42 and in an unprecedented manner. 43  This surge is primarily attributed to the growing requirements associated with the expansion of artificial intelligence operations (Will Wade, 2024). 44

Globally, electricity consumption by data centres in 2022 was estimated at 460 terawatt hours -  around  two  per  cent  of  final  electricity  demand  and  is  estimated  to  reach  1000 terawatt-hours by 2026 (International Energy Agency, 2024). 45  These data centres alone will consume six per cent of the US's total electricity demand in 2026, estimated to be around

200 terawatt-hours or roughly four per cent of the country's national demand in 2022 (IEA, 2024). 46  Besides, the concerns about 'bad harmonics' 47  of the AI-led surge in power demand from data centres, adversely affecting households, are getting attention as well.

Until recently, the major technology firms have offset their substantial carbon emissions by purchasing 'unbundled' 48  renewable energy certificates (RECs). This practice has allowed them to present a façade of sustainability, as it enables them to claim that the electricity they consume-potentially  sourced  from  fossil  fuel  facilities  like  coal  plants-originates  from renewable sources such as solar farms (Rathi &amp; White, 2024) 49  and pay much less for the purchase of the unbundled REC than the actual cost of abatement of that one unit of GHG emission by them. Instead, the growing power demand from data centres is likely to cause further expansion in natural gas-based electricity, which will only increase the emissions of developed countries. 50

The engagement of advanced economies in harmonising their technological goals with the imperatives of the energy transition will become more apparent over time, but it is apparent that increases in emissions are not being factored in.

## PROGRESS MADE ON INDIA'S ENERGY TRANSITION

10.32    India's  efforts  in  mitigation  have  been  ambitious.  India  has  successfully established  an  installed  electricity  generation  capacity  of  213,701  megawatts  from non-fossil fuel sources, which accounts for 46.8 per cent of the total capacity as of 30 November 2024 (see Chart 5). 51  The goal is to reach 50 per cent by 2030.

## New initiatives  and  updates  on  existing  policies/schemes  to  boost energy transition

10.34  The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) initially launched New Solar Power Scheme (for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) Habitations/

Villages) under Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) on 4 January 2024, which was later revised on 18 October 2024 to also include other tribal habitations/villages and renamed as New Solar Power Scheme (for Tribal and PVTG Habitations/Villages) under PM JANMAN and Dharti Aabha Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (DA JGUA). The Scheme will cover electrification of one lakh unelectrified households (HHs) in Tribal and PVTG areas of over 63000 villages identified by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) by the provision of off-grid solar systems. The scheme also includes provision for off-grid solar lighting in 1500 Multi-Purpose Centres (MPCs) in PVTG areas and solarisation of 2000 public institutions through offgrid solar systems. The off-grid solar systems shall be provided only where electricity supply through grid is not techno-economically feasible.

10.35  Additionally, the PM - Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana aims to install rooftop solar plants in one crore households, which is expected to enable approximately 30 gigawatts of residential rooftop solar capacity and contribute to an overall rooftop solar capacity addition of 40-45 gigawatts by 2027. So far, rooftop solar systems for more than 7 lakh households (as on 9 January 2025) have already been installed.

10.36  In  offshore  wind  energy,  the  Viability  Gap  Funding  (VGF)  scheme  has  been introduced, featuring a total budget of ₹7,453 crore. This includes VGF of ₹6,853 crore allocated for one gigawatt of projects (500 megawatts each off the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu), and ₹600 crore grant designated for upgrading two ports to enhance logistic infrastructure.

10.37  The  projects  under  the  Green  Energy  Corridor  (GEC)  aim  to  establish  an intra-state transmission system that enhances grid capabilities for renewable energy. Currently,  GEC-I  is  being  implemented  across  eight  states,  successfully  installing 9,136  circuit  kilometres  of  transmission  lines  and  21,413  megavolt-amperes  (MVA) substations. Meanwhile, GEC-II is progressing across seven additional states.

10.38  The  National  Bioenergy  Programme  is  structured  around  three  main  pillars: the  Waste  to  Energy  Programme,  the  Biomass  Programme,  which  supports  the manufacturing of briquettes and pellets as well as promotes biomass (non-bagasse) based  cogeneration  in  industries,  and  the  Biogas  Programme,  which  focuses  on promoting family-type biogas plants. As of 31 December 2024, the installed capacity for biomass power and cogeneration projects stood at approximately 9.8 gigawatts (gridconnected)  and  0.92-gigawatt  equivalent  (off-grid),  while  waste-to-energy  projects reached  a  capacity  of  249.74  megawatts  (grid-connected)  and  370.19-megawatt equivalent (as on 9 January 2025) (off-grid). Under the biogas programme, around 5.1  million  small  biogas  plants  and  361  medium-sized  biogas  plants  (totalling  11.5 megawatts) have been installed.

10.39  Furthermore, the Scheme for the Development of Solar Parks and Ultra-mega Solar Power Projects sets a target for establishing 40,000 megawatts of capacity. This scheme  focuses  on  developing  essential  infrastructure  such  as  land,  roads,  power evacuation systems, and water facilities,  ensuring  all  necessary  statutory  clearances and approvals are in place for the expedited development of utility-scale solar projects. As of 31 December 2024, 55 Solar Parks with a cumulative capacity of 39.9 gigawatts have been sanctioned across 13 states. Notably, solar projects with a capacity of 12.2 gigawatts  have  already  been  commissioned,  while  others  are  at  various  stages  of implementation.

10.40  The  Pradhan  Mantri  Kisan  Urja  Suraksha  evam  Utthaan  Mahabhiyan  (PMKUSUM)  aims  to  add  34.8  gigawatts  of  solar  capacity  by  promoting  small  gridconnected solar energy power plants, stand-alone solar-powered agricultural pumps, and the solarisation of existing grid-connected agricultural pumps. As of 31 December 2024, a decentralised solar capacity of 397 megawatts has been installed, along with the solarisation of 7.28 lakh agricultural pumps under this scheme.

10.41  To enhance the manufacturing capabilities in the solar sector, the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for the National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar Photovoltaic Modules has been initiated. The goal is to achieve a gigawatt-scale manufacturing capacity of high-efficiency solar photo-voltaic modules. So far, Letters of Award have been issued to establish manufacturing units with a total capacity of 48,337 megawatts.

10.42  The National Green Hydrogen Mission aims to achieve a production capacity of about five million metric tonnes per annum of Green Hydrogen, along with an associated renewable energy capacity of around 125 gigawatts and the potential for 50 million metric tonnes of CO2 annual emission abatement by 2030. The mission also focuses on bolstering research and development, as well as standards and testing within the green hydrogen ecosystem. Under the mission, the green hydrogen production capacity of 412,000 tonnes per annum and electrolyser manufacturing capacity of 3000 megawatts per annum have been successfully awarded.

10.43  Lastly, the Central Public Sector Undertaking Scheme Phase-II aims to establish grid-connected  solar  photo-voltaic  power  projects  funded  by  CPSUs,  state  PSUs, and  government  organizations,  utilising  domestically  manufactured  solar  PV  cells and  modules  with  VGF  support.  Out  of  approximately  8.2  gigawatts  of  sanctioned solar photo-voltaic capacity, 1.81 gigawatts have already been commissioned as of 31 December 2024.

## Lessons Learned

10.44  Lessons  learnt  from  the  experiences  of  developed  economies  caution  against shutting down thermal energy without adequate technological alternatives that allow a  stable  energy  supply.  India  is  uniquely  positioned  in  terms  of  its  growing  energy requirements. India must decisively leverage its best resources, advanced technologies, and expertise to accelerate its journey toward becoming a developed nation by 2047 while  ensuring  a  low-carbon  pathway.  Following  this  critical  milestone,  the  nation must  pursue  its  ambitious  goal  of  achieving  net  zero  emissions  by  2070.  This  will demand innovative strategies  and  strong  implementation  plans  to  confront  climate challenges while ensuring sustainable development takes centre stage. Innovation and investment in addressing the problems related to renewable energy - battery storage, grid infrastructure and critical minerals - must be the focus in the short to medium term.

## Developments in financial regulation on green investments

10.45  Based  on  the  2019  National  Guidelines  on  Responsible  Business  Conduct (NGRBC)  by  the  government,  SEBI  introduced  new  reporting  mandates  on  ESG parameters - the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) - for the top  1000  listed  companies,  mandatory  from  FY23,  replacing  the  previous  Business Responsibility  Report  (BRR)  of  2012.  The  BRSR  norms  were  further  expanded  in 2023, with the Board introducing the BRSR core for assurance and ESG disclosures for value chains by the listed entities. The value chain for the purpose of BRSR core reports encompasses  the  top  upstream  and  downstream  partners,  cumulatively  comprising 75 per cent of the purchases/sales (by value), respectively. From FY26, the top 500 listed entities would be mandated to report under BRSR core, which will be expanded to the top 1000 listed entities from FY27 onwards. The BRSR Core consists of a set of  Key  Performance Indicators (KPIs)/metrics under nine ESG attributes, including GHG emission  footprints,  water  footprints,  energy  footprint,  embracing  circularity, enhancing  employee  well-being  and  safety,  enabling  gender  diversity  in  business, enabling inclusive development, fairness in engaging with customers and suppliers, and open-ness of business.

10.46  SEBI also introduced the regulatory framework for the issuance of green debt securities in 2017, which outlines an illustrative list of activities that can be financed through green debt securities. The framework was revamped in 2023 by introducing the concepts of transition bonds (funds raised for transitioning to a more sustainable form of operations, in line with India's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions), blue bonds (related to water management and marine sector), and yellow bonds (related to solar energy), and circular economy as sub-categories of the green debt securities. The

framework mandates the issuers of green debt securities to disclose details related to the perceived social and environmental risks and proposed mitigation plan associated with the project(s) proposed to be financed/refinanced through the proceeds from the issue of green debt securities, in the offer documents. By March 2024, green debt securities amounting to a total of ₹6,128 crore have been issued by various listed companies. 53

10.47  In addition to these measures, the Government of India has included Sovereign Green  Bonds  (SGrBs)  in  its  overall  market  borrowings  with  the  aim  of  mobilising resources  for  green  infrastructure.  Adhering  to  the  framework  for  sovereign  green bonds that sets forth the obligations of the Government of India as a green bond issuer, the government has issued various lots of SGrBs of varying maturities of 5, 10 and 30 years. On the whole, SGrBs worth ₹16,000 crore were issued in FY23 and ₹20,000 crore in FY24. As for FY25, so far, the Government of India has raised 10-year SGrBs worth ₹11,697.40 crores and plans to raise ₹10,000 crore in remaining period of H2 FY25, i.e., ₹5,000 crore each under 10-year and 30-year securities, respectively.

10.48  In order to foster and strengthen the country's green finance ecosystem, the RBI put in place the framework for accepting Green Deposits for Regulated Entities (REs), with effect from 1 June 2023, to encourage green deposits to augment the flow of credit to green activities/projects address greenwashing concerns. RBI has also classified bank loans of up to ₹30 crore for borrowers seeking funding for renewable energy projects under  the  priority  sector  lending  category.  This  includes  solar  power  generators, biomass-based power generators, windmills, micro-hydel plants, and renewable energy public utilities such as street lighting systems and remote village electrification.

## BOX-X.5  Growing Carbon sink of forests in India

India's NDC aims to increase the carbon sinks by 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through improvement and addition of tree cover by 2030. As per the latest Forest Survey of India 2024, India is estimated to have a total carbon sink of 30.43 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2023, as compared to 2005, when the carbon sink was estimated to be 28.14 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The addition to the carbon sink between 2005 and 2023 is of 2.29 billion tonnes CO2 equivalent, closer to the NDC target. Based on the trends, the FSI projects a carbon sink of 31.71 billion tonnes in 2030, which would even surpass the NDC target of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.

## OPTIMISING LIFESTYLES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

10.49  The  policy  framework  established  by  Multilateral  Environment  Agreements provides a foundational structure for advancing environmental sustainability. Effective implementation relies on countries' actions in achieving their national sustainability goals,  ultimately  determined  by  individual  behaviours.  Recognising  the  need  for  a movement mobilising collective will towards moderating consumption and production habits,  India  introduced  the  Lifestyle  for  Environment  (LiFE)  Mission  at  COP26  in Glasgow in 2021. The LiFE Mission encourages the adoption of lifestyles that are in harmony with nature and are environmentally friendly. This initiative aims to create a collective impact that is 'greater than the sum of its parts,' significantly shaping the way environmental and climate challenges  are  addressed.  With  its  endorsement  by the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) at its sixth session in 2024, the mission has evolved into a global mass movement committed to promoting sustainable lifestyles among all participating member states while aligning with the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the Paris Agreement.

10.50   According to estimates, almost 17 per cent of all food available to consumers worldwide is wasted annually, amounting to more than 8 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that 'if food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitting country in the world '. 54 This highlights the significant potential for change through initiatives like Mission LiFE, which aims to mobilise at least one billion Indians and other global citizens to take both individual and collective actions to protect and conserve the environment from 2022 to 2028. Again, as brought out in the Economic Survey 2023-24, dietary preferences also impact emissions. Behavioural changes take time, as do lifestyle modifications. Household consumption accounts for around twothirds of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 55 . As per the UNFCCC, cutting dairy and meat from our diets can reduce our emissions by 66 per cent. 56 Switching to a plantbased diet can reduce an individual's annual carbon footprint by up to 2.1 tons with a vegan diet or up to 1.5 tons for vegetarians . 57  Nudging family, friends, and colleagues to a more sustainable dietary preference and moderation in lifestyles globally may be an idea whose time has come.

10.51 Within India, the goal is for at least 80 per cent of all villages and urban local bodies to become environmentally friendly by 2028 under this mission. The proactive implementation of LiFE measures can yield substantial co-benefits, including reducing inequalities in energy consumption, mitigating air pollution, achieving cost savings, and enhancing overall well-being and health. By 2030, it is estimated that these measures could save consumers around USD 440 billion globally through reduced consumption and lower prices. 58

10.52  There  are  several  effective  mechanisms  to  promote  low-carbon  lifestyles  and advance sustainable development. The Emissions Gap Report 2020 from the United Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  outlines  key  strategies  for  fostering meaningful lifestyle changes. Financial incentives, such as tax breaks for electric vehicles and  renewable  energy  use  subsidies,  can  motivate  individuals  and  organizations  to adopt greener practices. Additionally, educating the public about the environmental impacts  of  their  choices  is  essential.  Campaigns  that  highlight  the  benefits  of  lowcarbon alternatives and provide practical guidance can empower individuals to make sustainable  decisions.  Harnessing  social  influence  is  also  important.  By  leveraging peer pressure and engaging community involvement through social media and local initiatives, we can inspire sustainable behaviours and help establish a culture where low-carbon lifestyles are the norm.

10.53  Furthermore, encouraging citizen participation in sustainability decision-making at local and national levels is crucial for effective policymaking. Platforms for public input can lead to community-driven solutions. Finally, challenging existing habits and creating  new  norms  around  sustainability-such  as  promoting  cycling  or  local  food initiatives-can drive significant behavioural change over time. A combination of these

mechanisms is necessary to foster a transformative shift towards low-carbon lifestyles and a brighter, sustainable future.

10.54  The Indian government has introduced various measures to promote environmental  sustainability  and  influence  economic  behaviour.  Initiatives  like  the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyaan (PM KUSUM) and PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana encourage solar power adoption. High excise duties on fossil fuels and incentives for electric vehicles push for greener alternatives. The Ecomark scheme certifies eco-friendly household products, while the star-labelling scheme and 'Go Electric' campaign raise awareness about energy efficiency and electromobility. Market-based incentives, such as the Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, enhance energy efficiency, and waste management regulations minimise environmental impact. Expanding city metro networks also promotes a shift from private to public transport for a more sustainable transportation option.

## Green Credit Programme

10.55  Several key initiatives have been taken to enhance pro-environment outcomes by implementing measures consistent with LiFE.  One notable example is the introduction of the Green Credit Rules, 2023, for implementation of the Green Credit Programme (GCP). These rules are designed to incentivise voluntary efforts toward environmental conservation, resulting in the issuance of green credits. To begin with, voluntary tree plantation is envisaged on degraded land under the control and management of Forest Departments. The Ministry published notification for 'methodology for calculation of green credit in respect of tree plantation' on 22 February 2024. GCP Portal has been developed and is accessible to public and participants. So far, Seventeen state forest departments  are  participating  as  implementing  agencies  with  48,074  hectares  of degraded land registered.

## Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam

10.56  The  tree  plantation  campaign  'Ek  Ped  Maa  Ke  Naam'  is  another  example  of nudging individual behaviour to promote pro-environmental activities. Launched in June 2024 on World Environment Day, the campaign attempts to leverage the deep love and respect for mothers towards conserving mother nature. It successfully met its  ambitious  goal  of  planting  80  crore  seedlings  by  September  2024.  It  achieved  a remarkable feat  by  planting  over  5  lakh  saplings  by  the  128  Infantry  Battalion  and Ecological Task Force of the Territorial Army in just one hour on 22 September 2024.

## Swachh Bharat Mission

10.57  The Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) launched in 2014 signifies a fundamental transformation in India's pursuit of universal sanitation access and has revolutionised

the  hygiene  practices  of  a  substantial  portion  of  the  Indian  population.  SBM  2.0 integrates  comprehensive  waste  management  and  sanitation  practices  aligned  with sustainability  and  circular  economy  principles.  The  chapter  on  'Investment  and Infrastructure' discusses SBM in detail.

## Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency

10.58  The key objective of promoting a circular economy is to minimise waste, recover valuable materials, and reduce reliance on virgin resources. According to an estimate, the circularity of resources could lead to cost savings of 11 per cent of current GDP in 2030 and 30 per cent in 2050. 59  India has followed a multi-pronged approach through regulatory measures, financial incentives, and awareness campaigns in support of the circular  economy  and  the  improvement  of  resource  efficiency.  Recycling  e-waste  is important to supplement India's renewable energy drive by extracting useful resources from  the  wastes  of  solar  and  wind  energy  equipment.  Therefore,  the  government provides incentives to promote circularity, including tax benefits, subsidies, and lowinterest loans to the recycling industry. 60 India's extended producer responsibility (EPR) framework is an innovative mechanism for waste management in which manufacturers and producers are made responsible for the waste generated by their products postconsumption.  The  EPR  framework  encourages  producers  to  adopt  sustainable product design practices, increases the use of recycled materials, and supports waste management and recycling initiatives.

10.59  Plastic pollution is a major driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation and contributes to climate change. It will account for 15 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 61  India is one of the lowest per capita plastic consumers and generators of plastic waste in the world, with per capita plastic consumption of only 14 kg compared to that of the developed economies, which is more than 100 kg, much above the global average of 35 kg. 62   India's  Plastic  Waste  Management  Rules,  2016 provides the statutory framework for environmentally sound plastic waste management in the country. The rules mandate urban local bodies and gram panchayats to undertake plastic waste management, including plastic waste collection, and impose restrictions on their open incineration. Measures such as the ban on identified single-use plastic

items, which have high littering potential and low utility, with effect from 1 July 2022, coupled  with  the  implementation  of  EPR,  will  further  reduce  pollution  caused  by littered and unmanaged plastic waste.

## AIR POLLUTION

10.60  The World Health Organisation (WHO) data show that almost all of the global population (99 per cent) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. 63   Air pollution is a concern for the people of the northern part of India, especially Delhi and NCR, during the transition months from autumn to winter when pollutant levels frequently exceed the WHO guidelines (Chart 8). While there are anthropogenic reasons for the increase in particulate matter, such as vehicular traffic due to a distinct modal choice for private vehicles, agricultural practices, and use of coal and wood for cooking, geography and wind direction also play an important part in keeping the particulate matter from being dispersed.

10.61  The government launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in 2019 as a national-level strategy to reduce air pollution levels in 130 targeted non-attainment cities/million-plus cities across the country by implementing national, state and citylevel action plans. The NCAP emphasises the implementation of City Action Plans (CAPs) through the convergence of resources from various central government schemes such as Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), AMRUT, Smart City Mission, SATAT, and Nagar Van Yojana, as well as through resources from state governments/UT administration and agencies like municipal corporations and urban development authorities. Actions

under  the  'Graded  Response  Action  Plan  (GRAP)'  are  also  imposed  based  on  AQI. The GRAP calls for a set of emergent preventive/restrictive actions depending on air pollution levels, to be implemented by the identified agencies for combating the adverse air quality scenario. To address the issue of stubble burning, the government launched a scheme for 'Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh &amp; NCT of Delhi' in 2018, under which financial assistance is provided for the establishment of custom hiring centres (CHCs) and to farmers for purchase of crop residue management machinery.

## CONCLUSION

10.62  India's climate efforts are anchored in its ambitious commitment to achieve netzero emissions by 2070. This long-term goal is entwined with the country's aspirations for high and stable economic growth, which envisions becoming a developed nation by  2047.  Realising  this  vision  necessitates  a  delicate  balance,  achieving  low-carbon development while ensuring that critical imperatives such as affordable energy security, job  creation,  sustained  economic  expansion,  and  environmental  sustainability  are met.

10.63  To effectively navigate this dual challenge, India is adopting a holistic approach that embeds mitigation and adaptation in the growth strategy. Mitigation focuses on addressing the root causes of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while  adaptation  seeks  to  minimize  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change  through a robust framework for resilience. Given the backdrop of decreasing global financial commitments to support climate action in developing countries, India must increasingly prioritise  building  resilience  to  safeguard  the  benefits  of  its  rapid  economic  growth against climate-induced setbacks.

10.64  Adaptation and building resilience demand explicit and targeted policy measures, sufficient financing options, and the seamless integration of adaptive strategies into existing policies and developmental programs. It requires a multidimensional approach that encompasses a variety of initiatives, including the creation of appropriate policy incentives,  the  development  of  resilient  infrastructure,  research  and  development (R&amp;D) in climate-related technologies, and mobilising financial resources dedicated to adaptation initiatives. Additionally, it is essential that adaptation actions are tailored to be region-specific, considering India's vast and diverse geographic and agro-climatic landscape.

10.65  Despite being one of the world's lowest greenhouse gas emitters per capita, India has made notable strides in reducing the emissions intensity of its energy consumption.

This progress is largely due to the increased deployment of renewable energy sources alongside a suite of energy conservation measures. Nonetheless, the growth of renewable energy faces substantial hurdles, particularly in energy storage technologies and the sourcing of critical minerals necessary for this transition. While alternative solutions such as green hydrogen present a viable option for the medium term, affordability issues remain a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Furthermore, although nuclear energy could contribute to India's energy mix, its expansion is impeded by a lack of a supportive ecosystem and the monopolistic nature of nuclear fuel supply chains.

10.66  Lessons learned from the experiences of developed economies underscore the risks of prematurely shutting down thermal energy sources without viable technological alternatives  that  ensure  a  stable  energy  supply.  The  challenges  mentioned  above  in harnessing  renewable  energy  at  scale  indicate  that  India  will  need  to  continue  the efforts  to  maximise the efficiency of its existing fossil fuel resources in the medium term. The advancement and deployment of low-emission thermal power technologies, including Advanced Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) power plants, will play a pivotal role in this transition.

10.67  Investments in research and development related to battery storage technologies, as well as the recycling and sustainable disposal of waste associated with renewable energy  systems,  are  critical  factors  in  ensuring  a  reliable  supply  of  energy  from renewable sources and its sustainability. The mission mode approach to developing carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology is essential for the continued use and enhancement of thermal power plants in the medium term. In the agricultural sector, developing climate-resilient seeds and improving agricultural practices, which may include the  rejuvenation  of  water  bodies,  will  be  vital  components  in  building resilience against climate impacts.

10.68  The promotion of pro-environment lifestyle changes, as envisaged under India's LiFE Mission, has significant potential to contribute to climate change mitigation by encouraging low-carbon lifestyles and energy conservation behaviours. To transform the  LiFE  mission  into  a  widespread  public  movement,  a  comprehensive  awareness campaign is crucial-this could include integrating the principles of the LiFE mission into  school  and  college  curricula  to  foster  an  environmental  consciousness  from a  young  age.  The  successful  implementation  of  the  LiFE  initiative  could  provide India  with  compelling  evidence  of  achieving  more  sustainable  outcomes  with  fewer resources.

10.69  Accomplishing the goal of net zero emissions by 2070 will require innovative strategies and robust implementation plans designed to confront both the challenges

posed by climate change and the need for sustainable development to take centre stage. To  strengthen  its  renewable  energy  initiatives,  India  must  prioritise  investment  in extensive grid infrastructure improvements and the secure sourcing of critical minerals necessary for this transformative shift.
