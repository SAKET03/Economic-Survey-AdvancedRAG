## AIR POLLUTION

10.60  The World Health Organisation (WHO) data show that almost all of the global population (99 per cent) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. 63   Air pollution is a concern for the people of the northern part of India, especially Delhi and NCR, during the transition months from autumn to winter when pollutant levels frequently exceed the WHO guidelines (Chart 8). While there are anthropogenic reasons for the increase in particulate matter, such as vehicular traffic due to a distinct modal choice for private vehicles, agricultural practices, and use of coal and wood for cooking, geography and wind direction also play an important part in keeping the particulate matter from being dispersed.

10.61  The government launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in 2019 as a national-level strategy to reduce air pollution levels in 130 targeted non-attainment cities/million-plus cities across the country by implementing national, state and citylevel action plans. The NCAP emphasises the implementation of City Action Plans (CAPs) through the convergence of resources from various central government schemes such as Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), AMRUT, Smart City Mission, SATAT, and Nagar Van Yojana, as well as through resources from state governments/UT administration and agencies like municipal corporations and urban development authorities.

under  the  'Graded  Response  Action  Plan  (GRAP)'  are  also  imposed  based  on  AQI. The GRAP calls for a set of emergent preventive/restrictive actions depending on air pollution levels, to be implemented by the identified agencies for combating the adverse air quality scenario. To address the issue of stubble burning, the government launched a scheme for 'Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh &amp; NCT of Delhi' in 2018, under which financial assistance is provided for the establishment of custom hiring centres (CHCs) and to farmers for purchase of crop residue management machinery.
