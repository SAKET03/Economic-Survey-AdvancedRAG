## ENERGY TRANSITION - LEARNING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND WEIGHING THE OPTIONS

10.22  The first major energy transition from wood to coal began in the early eighteenth century,  coinciding  with  the  advent  of  the  first  industrial  revolution.  Two  centuries later, coal was overtaken by oil and gas around 1946 (O'Connor, 2010), 16  and fossil fuels became the primary energy source (Solomon &amp; Krishna, 2011). 17  The energy transition from wood to coal was motivated by several factors, of which industrialisation in Britain and concerns over the loss of forests due to enhanced logging were pre-dominant (Smil, 2019). 18  A more recent transition from oil to nuclear energy in France that began in the

1970s was driven by the oil embargo by oil-producing countries in 1973 (Solomon &amp; Krishna, 2011) 19  and the intent to reduce dependence on imported oil.

10.23  The energy transitions witnessed till the last century were driven by commercial interests  rather  than  the  will  to  limit  the  emissions  from  advanced  economies. Commercial  interests  and  energy  security  remain  the  most  significant  factors  in the  transition  pathway  even  today.  In  2022,  the  European  Union  introduced  the REPowerEU plan, 20  which aims to reduce dependence on Russian gas supplies. The plan includes a budget of € 10 billion allocated for investment in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and an additional € 1.5 to 2 billion designated for securing oil supplies. The European Union further amended its sustainable taxonomy 21   to include generating power and heat from fossil gaseous fuels as a transitional activity. In 2023, the US administration also approved the onset of the country's largest oil drilling project in the Alaska region, with an estimated total oil and non-gas liquids production of 628.9 million barrels and 260.79 million metric tons of associated indirect carbon dioxide equivalent of emissions. 22 Actions speak louder than words, with the biggest beneficiaries of carbon-intensive growth over several centuries holding on to fossil fuels even as they would want the developing countries to take up the less efficient, costlier and riskier options.

10.24  Recent  data  about  the  G7  countries  (Charts  2  and  3)  for  almost  the  last  six decades (1992 to 2023) shows that these countries continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels in their per capita primary energy consumption, shifting from coal and oil-based energy to gas-based energy.

10.25  The  friction  between  energy  transition  and  energy  security  is  clearly  evident in  the  actions  of  developed  countries,  revealing  the  limitations  of  transitioning  to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. First is the significant 'congestion cost' of managing a complex energy system incorporating fossil fuels and renewables. With the shift to renewable energy, there has also been an increasing trend in electricity prices (Chart 4). The congestion and higher cost have led to instances of wind turbines being curtailed due to grid limitations, necessitating the activation of gas plants to meet peak demand (Will Mathis, 2024) 23 , (Oliver, 2024) 24 . The shift from coal to natural gas as the base load has been the policy choice for ensuring grid stability in the UK and other developed countries. Developed countries have utilised their most abundant fuel in their transition. The transition to renewable energy has been tardy, forcing a return to fossil fuels to ensure stable supply and address rising electricity prices.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development also includes a dedicated and stand-alone goal on energy, SDG 7, which calls for countries to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all".

energy mixes and energy efficiency scenarios, Bhattacharyya et al. 2022 26  estimated that the minimum level of per capita final energy requirement for India to become a developed country with an HDI of 0.9 must be in the range of 45.7 to 75 gigajoules per year. As per the Energy Statistics of India 2024, provisional estimates indicate that the total final consumption of energy per capita for FY23 was 16,699 megajoules or 16.7 gigajoules (~approx.), 27  indicating that the gap between actual and required future energy consumption to fuel growth to achieve Viksit Bharat status is quite huge.

10.27  One of the key pillars of SDG7 is the expansion of renewable energy; however, it is clear that even in the most advanced economies, the technologies for renewable energy and their implementation are not yet at a maturity level that allows them to fully replace fossil fuel-based power plants. Several challenges hinder renewable energy's cost-effective and efficient integration into the energy mix. These include significant investments required for grid integration, the development of battery infrastructure to manage intermittency, scaling up production of the components of renewable energy systems, access to critical minerals that are needed for storage technology, the limited availability of land in densely populated areas and the competing and rapidly increasing energy demands from agriculture, infrastructure, and industry.

10.28  Coal has an important role to play in India's sustainable development. 28  Around 88 per cent of the US's coal-fired capacity was built between 1950 and 1990. 29  On the other hand, the United Kingdom, driven by their industrialisation, started very early and their coal-run power plants dominating the energy supply till the late 1970s when natural  gas  was  identified  as  a  reliable  substitute. 30 In  India's  case,  most  capacity additions to the coal-fired power plants were made only in the 2010s. 31 There is no valid economic rationale for shutting down coal plants in India, leaving huge investments underutilised and stranded and without a dependable alternative in place. The US and European countries may transition from coal to natural gas because they have access to

that resource, and their older conventional coal-based thermal plants are nearing the end of their life cycle. Unlike many developed countries, India's only reliable energy source is coal, 32 as it possesses around 10 per cent of the world's coal reserves but only 0.7 per cent of the world's natural gas reserves. 33

10.29  Presently, given the resource endowments, coal cannot be neglected as a reliable and affordable source of energy for India's development. India has, however, taken a leading role in climate action, with the government implementing measures to reduce emissions in the economy. One key strategy has been to promote the efficient use of coal by utilising super-critical (SC), ultra-super-critical (USC) and the recent Advanced Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) technologies in coal-based power plants. Back in 2010, India commissioned its first power unit based on supercritical technology, and by the middle of 2024, a total capacity of 65,290 megawatts (94 Units) and 4,240 megawatts (06 units) in supercritical and ultra-supercritical technology-based power units have been  commissioned  respectively. 34   Further,  more  recently,  the  National  Thermal Power  Corporation  Limited  (NTPC)  and  Bharat  Heavy  Electricals  Limited  (BHEL) have developed an Indigenous Advance Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) technology and are setting up an 800-megawatt AUSC technology-based Thermal Power Plant. This AUSC power plant will reduce emissions by about 11 per cent compared to super-critical plants. 35

10.30  Among the other cleaner sources of energy, nuclear, being an efficient source of energy, has increasingly emerged as a reliable alternative to fossil fuel. However, there are challenges. The expansion of the use of nuclear power has to contend with public concerns about safety and the uncertainty that the latest technologies are controlled by a few countries (Jayanti, 2023). 36  Geographical concentration (Economic Survey, 20222023; 2023-2024) 37  of uranium and other essential minerals also poses a challenge. Besides,  nuclear  energy  relies  heavily  on  the  stability  of  fossil  fuel  supply  chains  to

produce sulfuric acid for uranium extraction (Maslin et al., 2022). 38  By 2040, estimates suggest that a shortfall of sulfuric acid supply could range from 100 million to 320 million tonnes, 39  depending on the extent of efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Furthermore, even in the short run, actions by key players can pose a risk to the growth of the nuclear power sector (Dempsey, 2024). 40  The significance of nuclear energy, given its higher efficiency and low greenhouse gas emissions, requires a forward-looking perspective to address potential challenges in advance, facilitating a smoother transition.

10.31 Further, the challenge of disposing of renewable energy technologies, especially solar panels, reveals how environmental policies can create complex issues. The state of California, a leader in promoting rooftop solar for two decades, did not develop a comprehensive  plan  for  managing  the  end-of-life  of  these  systems  (Kisela,  2022). 41 Disassembling and recycling solar panels is complex and demands highly specialised equipment and skilled workers. Implementing proper waste management strategies for renewable energy systems is imperative, as neglecting to address this issue could lead to significant environmental contamination. Effective disposal methods must be developed  to  manage  by-products  and  materials  associated  with  renewable  energy technologies to mitigate potential negative impacts on ecosystems and public health.

## BOX-X.4  New Emission Sources: Are they being accounted for?

The demand for electricity in the United States is projected to increase significantly 42 and in an unprecedented manner. 43  This surge is primarily attributed to the growing requirements associated with the expansion of artificial intelligence operations (Will Wade, 2024). 44

Globally, electricity consumption by data centres in 2022 was estimated at 460 terawatt hours -  around  two  per  cent  of  final  electricity  demand  and  is  estimated  to  reach  1000 terawatt-hours by 2026 (International Energy Agency, 2024). 45  These data centres alone will consume six per cent of the US's total electricity demand in 2026, estimated to be around

200 terawatt-hours or roughly four per cent of the country's national demand in 2022 (IEA, 2024). 46  Besides, the concerns about 'bad harmonics' 47  of the AI-led surge in power demand from data centres, adversely affecting households, are getting attention as well.

Until recently, the major technology firms have offset their substantial carbon emissions by purchasing 'unbundled' 48  renewable energy certificates (RECs). This practice has allowed them to present a façade of sustainability, as it enables them to claim that the electricity they consume-potentially  sourced  from  fossil  fuel  facilities  like  coal  plants-originates  from renewable sources such as solar farms (Rathi &amp; White, 2024) 49  and pay much less for the purchase of the unbundled REC than the actual cost of abatement of that one unit of GHG emission by them. Instead, the growing power demand from data centres is likely to cause further expansion in natural gas-based electricity, which will only increase the emissions of developed countries. 50

The engagement of advanced economies in harmonising their technological goals with the imperatives of the energy transition will become more apparent over time, but it is apparent that increases in emissions are not being factored in.
