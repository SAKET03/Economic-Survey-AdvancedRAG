## LABOUR IN THE AI ERA: CRISIS OR CATALYST?

<!-- image -->

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) presents both unprecedented opportunities  and  significant  challenges  for  labor  markets  worldwide.  In this context, as policymakers, it is important to pay attention to the evolving technological  landscape  and  the  potential  impact  it  can  have  on  the  labour market.  Historical  parallels  with  earlier  technological  revolutions  reveal  the critical  role  of  inclusive  institutions  in  managing  disruption  and  ensuring equitable outcomes.

Barriers  to  large-scale  AI  adoption  persist  in  the  present,  which  include concerns  over  reliability,  resource  inefficiencies,  and  infrastructure  deficits. These  challenges,  along  with  AI's  experimental  nature,  create  a  window  for policymakers  to  act.  India's  demographic  advantage  and  diverse  economic landscape  position  it  uniquely  to  benefit  from  AI.  However,  achieving  these benefits requires significant investments in education and workforce skilling, supported by enabling, insuring, and stewarding institutions. These mechanisms can help workers adapt to changing demands while providing essential safety nets.

By  fostering  collaboration  between  policymakers,  the  private  sector,  and academia, India can align AI-driven innovation with societal goals. Ensuring inclusivity and sustainability in this transition is key to maximizing benefits while minimizing  disruptions.  With  robust  institutional  frameworks  and  strategic planning, AI can serve not as a crisis but as a catalyst for equitable economic transformation, positioning India to thrive in an increasingly automated world.

## INTRODUCTION

13.1  Concerns and fears about Artificial Intelligence (AI) disrupting labour markets have intensified as developments in the field have continually demonstrated rapid progress over  the  last  four  years.  The  increasing  complexity  of  the  models  being  developed today represent a paradigm shift in the field of AI, showing the world that in a few years, 'intelligent machines' will be capable of performing tasks that are predominantly handled by humans today. The founder of the AI research and deployment company OpenAI recently stated in a blog post how they are expecting to have office ready 'AI workers' by the end of 2025 1 .

13.2 Expectations  point  toward  a  trend  where  AI  begins  outperforming  humans  in critical decision-making processes in areas like healthcare, criminal justice, education, business and financial services among others. Adding to the uncertainties of tomorrow is the fact that the speed of research and development is outpacing the regulatory and ethical  frameworks  needed  to  manage  its  risks.  Further,  with  executives  optimistic about the capabilities of AI 2 and the cost-saving potential they expect it to possess, the impact of AI on the labour market, particularly entry-level jobs is turning into a point of concern for policymakers. This economic displacement adds to a broader sense of unease about whether AI will exacerbate existing social and economic divides.

13.3 With AI research and development currently concentrated in the hands of a few, very large companies that control the resources to erect high entry barriers, AI adoption in place of humans presents the risk of concentrating the benefits of automation. Korinek and Stiglitz (2021) warn that labour- and resource-saving automation could produce a 'winner-takes-all' approach to the detriment of developing countries who are labourand  resource-rich 3 .  Technological  developments  that  worsen  inequality  can  erode any possible benefit that the innovation brings, leaving the public sector responsible for addressing the cost of the transition. This has led to calls for a more responsible approach to AI adoption 4 , especially in a country like India where employment numbers make the magnitude of impact something worth paying attention to.

13.4 Although until this point, the use of AI/Machine Learning (ML) 5  enabled tools and applications  were  already  widespread  and  part  of  productivity  suites  for  years, the end-user's facetime with the integrated 'AI' features was essentially minimal and unconscious. Examples include the autocomplete function on a smartphone keyboard, Google's  and  Apple's  smartphone  virtual  assistants,  personalised  recommendations on e-commerce platforms and media streaming services, and curated feeds on social media sites, among many others. Most users never paid much attention to the host of ML-powered features while enjoying the convenience they delivered. This changed in light of the developments witnessed in the last four years. The perceptions about AI has now drastically shifted, spurring debates about the need to align AI developments with broader societal goals.

13.5  OpenAI  has  initiated  an  'arms  race'  in  AI  as  between  2022  and  2024,  many companies, including big tech firms, have scrambled to capitalise on the demand for AI.

4  A letter jointly written by Dr. Rajiv Kumar (former Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog), Sridhar Vembu (CEO, Zoho Corporation) &amp; Sharad Sharma (Co-founder of the iSPIRT Foundation) highlights their concerns.

5  While Artificial Intelligence is used to describe the ability of a machine to mimic human intelligence, machine learning is a subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data and improve without being explicitly programmed.

Examples include but are not limited to Google (Gemini), Microsoft (Co-Pilot), Meta (MetaAI with Llama), X/Twitter (Grok), Anthropic (Claude AI), Midjourney, Perplexity AI (Perplexity) and Stability AI (Stable Diffusion), among others. The number of AI patents granted globally increased 62.7 per cent to just over 62,000 between 2021 and 2022 6 . Similarly, the annual global private investments in Generative AI surged from approximately USD 3 billion in 2022 to USD 25.2 billion by the end of 2023 7 . Between 2021 and 2023, global corporate investments in all types of AI totalled USD 761 billion. Additionally, an increasing share of companies have been referencing AI in their earning calls lately 8 , with CEOs expecting AI adoption to lower labour requirements.

13.6 If one were to look at these trends and the value generation expected from the investments, it would appear as if the 'AI revolution' is here and labour is soon going to be a thing of the past. Unease about what AI entails for workers and what it means for humanity as a whole has become part of daily discussions among academicians and policymakers, as reflected in many publications and reports. Making sense of these fears and anxieties would require a more in-depth breakdown of the short-term and long-term  implications.  Since  there  are  many  unknowns  associated  with  AI  at  this point, looking at the present through the lens of previous technological revolutions may provide some insights into the way forward. Advancing the understanding about the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead is the purpose of this essay.

13.7  In this regard Section 2 brings to light the adverse effects that emerged during previous technological revolutions and how they pertain to present-day concerns about Artificial  Intelligence.  The  section  also  elaborates  on  the  importance  of  remaining cognisant, as disruptions that are not carefully managed can lead to permanent societal damage for a country like India. Section 3 then goes on to discuss how these risks can be minimised through the creation of Social Infrastructure i.e., Institutions. The priority here is minimisation since the risks can never be fully mitigated. That is the price of innovation induced creative destruction. The various types of institutions detailed in this section can provide a much needed support system to ease the pains of a transition.

13.8 However, building institutions is a time consuming process, requiring concerted effort from the public sector, the private sector and members of academia. In Section 4, we put forward the hypothesis that India, at present, is afforded this time due to the challenging nature of scaling up technological adoption. Deployment at scale will require AI developers to address certain key challenges which requires a non-trivial

amount of time. Section 5 then outlines possible opportunities that AI may open up for India. It seeks to visualise a possible labour market evolution where the future of work is augmented by AI. Whether or not we go down this path will depend entirely on how robust our institutions are. Section 6 concludes the essay.

## REVOLUTIONS AND RIPPLES

13.9 The present discourse on AI from international organisations and social science researchers  postulates  that  large  scale  labour  market  disruptions  due  to  AI  may materialise in the near-term. The International Monetary Fund states that AI poses risks of job displacements, notably for emerging markets and developing economies, which are not well placed to leverage the technology relative to the advanced economies 9 . The International Labour Organisation estimates that nearly 75 million jobs globally are at complete risk of automation due to AI 10 . Estimates for the UK show that 7 per cent of the existing UK jobs face a high risk of automation in the near term, rising to around 18 per cent after 10 years 11 .  Industry experts have told media outlets that 'AI models could dramatically disrupt the labour market, including replacing routine jobs in some sectors. 12 ' A study by the Bank for International Settlements finds that 45 per cent of the  jobs  in  the  upper  quartile  of  the  wage  distribution  remain  exposed  to  AI  in  the United States. If AI becomes highly capable, exposure increases across all quartiles of the income distribution 13 .

13.10 Estimates  from  private  sector  firms  paint  a  similar  picture.  Goldman  Sachs economists state that nearly 300 million full-time jobs remain exposed to AI-driven automation 14 .  McKinsey  estimates  demonstrate  how,  by  2030,  up  to  30  per  cent  of current work hours could be automated by generative AI 15  across Europe and the United States. They state that businesses will 'need a major skill upgrade' as the deployment of  AI  would  raise  the  demand  for  social  and  emotional  skills  along  with  a  need  for

critical thinking and creativity. In line with the IMF estimates, insights from Ernst &amp; Young state that while the impact of AI on emerging economies is lower relative to the advanced economies, one can still expect 57 per cent of occupations in emerging countries  to  be  affected  by  higher  Generative  AI  adoption 16 .  Similar  sentiments  are prevalent among surveyed CEOs 17  and other private sector estimates 18 .

13.11    Anxieties about the effects of AI remain high in India as well, considering our country is a services-led economy. Among white-collar workers, an IIM Ahmedabad Survey highlights how 68 per cent of the surveyed employees expect their jobs to be partially  or  fully  automated  by  AI  within  the  next  five  years 19 .  Forty  per  cent  of  the employees believe AI will make their skills  redundant.  Copestake  et  al.  (2023)  also state that firms have substantially increased AI skill demand across regions, industries, firms and occupations 20 . As per their findings, these jobs pay a 13 to 17 per cent salary premium over baseline estimates. India's banking sector is also witnessing adoption among well-capitalised and larger banks, per a recently published RBI study 21 . With trends expected to continue towards even higher AI adoption by the private sector and the market, NASSCOM estimates that the Indian AI market will grow at 25 to 35 per cent CAGR by 2027 22 .

13.12 These estimates are substantial and when viewed through the lens of history, one could argue that concerns, to a degree, are valid. Previous technological revolutions have been painful, and the damage brought on has been long lasting. Andrew Haldane illustrates that in the pursuit of productivity and profits, the substitution of labour for capital  has  resulted  in  widespread  economic  hardship,  damaging  social  cohesion 23 . Each  revolution  displaced  large  segments  of  the  workforce.  Many  struggled  to  find new employment, especially in geographies and occupations where the scale of impact was unanticipated or underestimated. Consequently, income inequality rose, as those who adapted to  new  technological  demands  saw  their  wages  increase,  while  others experienced declining pay and fewer opportunities. Recent experiences of the same,

such as the drastic loss of employment among coal mining workers across the United States brought about by the energy transition, demonstrates just how susceptible to shocks the labour market can be 24 .

13.13 Societal impacts of these revolutions also extends to economic disparity. Workers may not immediately benefit from the productivity and profitability gains associated with technological advancements. For instance, during the early stages of the industrial revolution, wages frequently lagged behind increases in productivity. These transitions were also protracted, as it could take decades for displaced workers to find alternative livelihoods. The first Industrial revolution exemplifies this dynamic, with workers who were laid off  facing  sustained  unemployment well into the 19th Century - a period known as 'Engle's pause'. Thus, societies where the balance between capital and labour was not carefully managed by capable institutions were marked by enduring hardships for many who were affected.

13.14 Protracted labour displacement is something that a labour-surplus country like India cannot afford. Our primary challenge is the challenge of numbers. As highlighted in  the  Economic  Survey  2023-24,  India  would  have  to  create  an  average  of  78.5 lakh jobs annually in the non-farm sector by 2030 to cater to the rising workforce. Further, India is a majorly services driven economy, with a significant share of the I.T. workforce employed in low value added services. Such jobs are the most susceptible to automation, as firms in a bid to cut costs may substitute labour for technology. We already see this in case of tech-firms in India 25 and the BPO sector in Philippines 26 . India is also a consumption based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course.

13.15 In such a situation, placing a higher weightage on the possibility of an adverse consequence is required as complacency can amplify any negative effects by creating a long-lasting impact. It is the uncertainty associated with the timeline and magnitude of effects that demands the attention of policymakers. In the words of Alan Greenspan, 'Uncertainty  is  not  the  same  as  risk…Uncertainty  involves  unknown  probabilities and  outcomes  with  tremendous  consequences. 27 '  Any  outcome  with  tremendous

consequences needs to be taken seriously, no matter how low the probability is. Since policymaking is a wicked problem, one would rather overestimate the uncertainties and be overprepared than underestimate the effects and have to manage the fallout.

13.16 Responding  to  these  uncertainties  requires  coordinated  efforts  aimed  at addressing the structural issues that can intensify the impact of AI on India's labour market. It is here, the establishment of new, and upgrading existing Institutions will play  a  pivotal  role.  Social  Infrastructure  will  provide  the  required  foundation  for ensuring that the gains from technology can translate into inclusive growth.

## THE NEED FOR ROBUST INSTITUTIONS

13.17 Minimising  the  magnitude  of  the  negative  effects  resulting  from  creative destruction  has  always  necessitated  a  'societal  response',  one  where  new  social infrastructure  is  created  to  foster  environments  where  innovation  drives  inclusive growth. The most notable work highlighting the importance of institutional capacity is  Daron  Acemoglu  and  James  Robinson's  book,  'Why  Nations  Fail 28 .'  Inclusive Institutions can promote broad participation in the gains from innovation and create the conditions for sustained economic growth and prosperity. They are the hands that shape a country's economic destiny.

13.18 Eric Posner reinforces the importance of building adequate institutional capacity by pointing out a grim scenario that is possible if the most optimistic AI projections are to be believed. He states, 'There is no social safety net generous enough to protect people from the mental-health effects, and society from the political turmoil, that would follow from widespread disappointment and alienation [due to substantial and permanent unemployment]. 29 ' This would be the least desirable outcome.

13.19 High-quality institutions act as mediators, ensuring that technological advancements  yield  broad-based  benefits,  while  weak  or  absent  institutions  often exacerbate disparities, resulting in uneven economic and social outcomes. For India to seriously consider the effects of AI, actions will have to focus on strong Institution Building. In this context, Andrew Haldane splits the institutional requirement along two broad categories; enabling institutions and insuring institutions.

13.20  Enabling Institutions are focused on equipping the workforce with the necessary skills needed to adapt and thrive in a shifting landscape. They impart skills and augment

28    Robinson, J. A., &amp; Acemoglu, D. (2012). Why nations fail: The origins of power, prosperity and poverty (pp. 4547). London: Profile.

the  content  of  education,  ensuring  that  learning  keeps  up  with  the  demands  of  the job market. Further, as new auxiliary tasks and sectors emerge from the widespread adoption  of  technology,  enabling  institutions  facilitate  the  smooth  transition  of  the workforce to these new jobs, reducing the damage to worker income and preventing loss employability. The latter is of paramount importance, because if transitions are not  carefully  managed,  workers  can  experience  a  long-lasting  unemployment,  with little prospect of catching up to market demands. As India's workforce in low-skill and low-value-added services remains vulnerable to AI, robust enabling institutions are essential to help transition workers to medium- and high-skilled jobs, where AI can augment their efforts rather than replace them.

13.21 Insuring  Institutions  are  intended  to  provide  a  soft-landing  for  workers whose  finances  have  been  hit  and  whose  well-being  has  been  affected  during  the transitionary  period.  These  institutions  help  secure  a  standard  of  living  during  the shift,  keep  inequalities  in  check  and  aid  in  keeping  the  social  fabric  cohesive.  They are also responsible for reducing the recession risk, for individuals and for societies. Insuring Institutions build safety nets (such as the National Insurance Act, 1911 and the Beveridge Report, 1942 in the UK), protect worker rights, provide finances (such as credit unions), housing (the emergence of the Young Men's Christian Association during the 19th century), and social and emotional support during periods of displacement.

13.22  In addition to the two outlined by Haldane, we propose the necessity of a third institution, Stewarding Institutions. The products of science are neither good, nor bad and what determines their net-impact on society is how they are applied. This application depends on how society comes to define the technology's utility, the ethics that govern its  applications and the rules that structure their place in society. It is important to clarify that stewarding in this case does not imply placing restrictions on innovation or dictating a narrow set of applications for technology. It implies that policymakers demonstrate a certain degree of cognisance when it comes to emerging technologies, so that when the need arises, they stand well-placed to mitigate any adverse effects that emerge as by-products of technological applications. These institutions would be agile, crosscutting across sectors and up to date on the latest developments, so that they are equipped to identify both opportunities and threats. Stewarding institutions will have to be responsible for designing an approach that delicately balances public welfare without stifling innovation. They are also required for fostering the social acceptability of AI by promoting the right levels of transparency and accountability in AI applications. For instance, AI applications in healthcare, health insurance and education would greatly benefit from higher-degrees of transparency and accountability, as these sectors are way more human-centric relative to others. Biases in models being applied to these sectors can result in adverse, unintended consequences.

13.23  Building  each  of  these  institutions  is  a  time-consuming  process  due  to  the challenges  involved  in  mobilising  the  required  intellectual  and  financial  resources. Their  need  is  not  immediately  clear  and  aligning  our  social  structures,  regulators, cooperatives, and policymaking institutions towards a distant goal is often an uphill battle. However, unlike previous technological revolutions, advancements in AI today and the utility it has the potential to deliver are being shared by all countries thanks to a globalised world. AI presently being in its infancy has made it so that every nation, irrespective of its income level is on equal footing as far as discovering its applicability goes. This level playing field provides India the time to build the necessary institutions that will minimise the disruptions and maximise societal benefits.

13.24  Another reason we postulate that India has the time available to reinforce and build  supporting  institutions  is  due  to  the  nature  of  technological  revolutions.  For technologies to be widely adopted, they have to overcome several obstacles that make them ubiquitous. Historically, technologies that have positioned themselves as General Purpose  Technologies  have  done  so  through  refinement  and  increasing  cost-effectiveness. This then created the demand for the technology, reorienting macroeconomic processes around it by changing the way we invest, what we demand, the education we impact and the quantity of labour we demand. The road to a reorientation of this size is long and we hypothesize that it could be no different for scaling AI adoption. For AI to be widely applicable in the real world, it needs to be made practical, reliable, requires the establishment of supporting infrastructure and has to achieve sufficient levels of resource efficiencies to be viable.

## VISION TO VIABILITY: AI'S REAL WORLD CHALLENGES

## Differentiating between Breakthrough and Practicality

13.25  A  breakthrough  in  the  context  of  technology  refers  to  a  significant  discovery that overcomes a major barrier, enabling new possibilities or dramatically advancing the state of the art. It is also characterized by its ability to solve previously unsolvable problems, introduce novel capabilities, or revolutionise existing systems, processes, or industries. This is the stage at which Artificial Intelligence finds itself right now. Large Language Models are capable of acing exams and achieving high test scores, but the field is still far from having a model come up with original, publishable research.

13.26  Conversely,  practicality  refers  to  feasibility,  effectiveness,  and  usefulness  in addressing real-world problems or needs. This also encompasses ease of implementation, cost-effectiveness, scalability, user access, and the ability to deliver clearly measurable benefits.  Achieving  this  stage  is  the  most  challenging  part  since  many  innovations

that emerged over the years have been clear breakthroughs but failed to find the mass acceptance that comes to characterise a General Purpose Technology. AI today has the potential to deliver clearly measurable benefits in terms of productivity, but the costs, especially in terms of investment required is high.

13.27 At its current stage of development, AI is more experimental as it is still finding its footing.  This  is  not  inherently  negative,  as  it  signifies  innovation's  curious  and  exploratory nature. However, from a practical standpoint, its experimental nature makes its realworld  utility  unclear  despite  the  technology  demonstrating  impressive  capabilities. For instance,  the  pursuit  of  smarter  AI  models  promises  to  propel  the  applicability of self-driving cars but identifying why they are needed, their cost-effectiveness, and social acceptability remains an ongoing challenge. Similarly, chatbots can convincingly simulate human conversation but their practical effectiveness in customer service is not established since customers prefer having their complex questions dealt with by humans 30 .

13.28  The  industry  has  placed  its  chips  on  increasing  AI  adoption,  hoping  that  if the  technology  reaches  as  broad  an  audience  as  possible,  users  will,  on  their  own, eventually come up with more applications, thus validating the technology. For now, while AI is useful in exploring and optimising certain jobs, particularly ones that are knowledge-based or creative, the full scope of its practicality is still limited due to the degree of human intervention necessary in order to extract useful outputs. AI models, particularly  overly  complex  generative  AI  which  are  too  rich  and  have  too  many parameters are unconcerned with the truth, unconcerned with the 'correctness' of its output and unconcerned with the realities of the world. It is known to 'hallucinate' and generate outputs that are not based on what is true but rather on what is the best fit for question 31 . Utilising AI to the best of its abilities right now requires one to be fully aware of its limitations.

## Reliability

13.29  In most day-to-day use cases involving personal use, even an error rate of 10 per cent would not have any significant impact since the user would most likely identify the error and correct it. The stakes are much higher when it comes to deploying AI in business and real-world applications as the severity of the consequences will vary from one application to another. A customer service chatbot might have many chances to correct misunderstandings, whereas a path planning algorithm for an autonomous vehicle gets only one chance to get it right. Ignoring the reliability problem and hasty implementation results in severe, unintended consequences.

13.30  Several  examples  noted  in  a  publication  by  McKendrick  and  Thurai  (2022) demonstrate the non-negotiable nature of reliability 32 . A self-driving car fatally struck a  pedestrian  on  a  four-lane  road  because  it  failed  to  recognize  the  individual  as  a pedestrian, as the person was not near a crosswalk, which was the typical circumstance represented in its training data. Application of AI in recruitment turned out to prefer male candidates over female applicants due to the larger number of males in its training sample. The company attempted several times to make the AI screener gender-neutral but failed. Predictive Policing using AI also tends to have a bias against minorities 33 .

13.31 Time-tested  liability  frameworks  applicable  to  commercial  products  may  not apply in a straightforward manner to AI products as solving the reliability problem is  also  necessary  to  mitigate  risks  from  AI  applications 34 .  Additionally,  given  the nuanced relationship between humans and accountability, individuals tend to feel less responsible as their direct involvement in actions decreases. This phenomenon becomes particularly significant when artificial intelligence is used to replace human decisionmaking within firms and organizations. The introduction of AI further distances humans from  the  ethical  responsibilities  traditionally  tied  to  decision-making,  potentially exacerbating a lack of accountability. In such frameworks, where firms increasingly rely on AI as a substitute for human judgment, the importance of ensuring AI's reliability becomes paramount. This is because, unlike humans, AI lacks the inherent capacity for accountability, making the ethical and operational implications of its use even more critical to address.

13.32  Arvind  Narayanan  and  Sayash  Kapoor  of  Princeton  note  that  LLMs  are  'not reliable  enough  to  be  successful  products'  -  yet 35 .  They  state  that  for  AI  to  achieve mass adoption, companies need to start approaching AI development like Software development. The product needs to be reliable and dependable. Until such a time, the labour displacement effects of AI may not be widespread since human oversight will be a must for any kind of AI application.

## The Infrastructure Challenge

13.33  The third criterion for the diffusion of new technology is growth in supporting infrastructure. As illustrated by Carlota Perez in her book investigating the history of technological revolutions 36 , the necessary infrastructure is crucial for the proliferation

of new technology as it provides the externalities that facilitate adoption and widespread use. The infrastructure is installed in the initial phase when the excitement over the potential of the new technology runs high, creating the conditions for the full deployment of the technology in the coming decades.

13.34  Canals, waterways, and turnpike roads provided the connectivity required for the industrial revolution, facilitating the movement of inputs and finished goods. The age of the automobile gained momentum due to the construction of roads and highways all across the United States. The expansion of the electricity grid provided households access to power, thus fuelling the demand for home appliances and leading to the era of  mass  production.  The  proliferation  of  computers  and  infrastructure  created  for telecommunications gave impetus to the adoption of the Internet.

13.35  Once a  technology  had  proven  its  practicality  (more  than  its  reliability,  as  reliability would  be  fine-tuned  with  subsequent  iterations  of  the  technology),  infrastructure creation naturally followed. However, since building infrastructure is a highly timeconsuming process, the full potential of the technology could not be harnessed till the support infrastructure was widely available. The development of AI, and the rate of adoption is similarly going to depend on the availability of quality infrastructure and the pace of its creation.

13.36  Infrastructure,  in  the  case  of  AI,  is  not  as  straightforward  as  in  previous technological revolutions since its requirements transcend the physical realm. Apart from the already-known aspects such as land, reliable chip supply, and data centres, chief  among  AI  infrastructure  is  data,  which  is  the  lifeblood  of  AI  development. Training AI models cannot be done on raw data, as previously discussed; data is highly prone to bias the model. Additionally, data in its raw form can include instances of toxicity, vulgar content, and other dimensions that can lead to the model performing unexpectedly. More often than not, prior to data making its way into the training set for a model, it is extensively cleaned by humans who filter the dataset for any and all of the issues mentioned above. Cleaning introduces its own set of biases as data can be included or excluded at the discretion of the developers, biasing the overall output of the model.

13.37 For  AI  to  be  widely  adopted  across  industries,  a  holistic  infrastructure  that combines technological resources, human expertise, and organisational readiness is needed. Changes of this magnitude take time to materialise, and even longer to reach the point where the new technology seamlessly synergises with the entire value-addition process. Thus, concerns over AI displacing labour may be somewhat ameliorated by the time it takes for complementary facilities needed for AI adoption at scale, to emerge.

## The Resource Challenge

13.38  The most critical obstacle to the large-scale proliferation of AI in the medium term is resource efficiency. For AI to scale effectively, technological advancements and performance gains must be coupled with significant reductions in costs and more efficient utilisation of scarce resources-an achievement that remains elusive. The challenge is compounded by the fact that modern AI systems, still in their developmental infancy, demand enormous investment in research and development. Moreover, the prevailing trajectory in AI development prioritises performance over cost-effectiveness, driven by a belief that any compromise on model performance in favour of cost savings would lead to subpar outcomes. This approach, while understandable, underscores the urgency of addressing the pressing need for sustainable and efficient AI innovations.

13.39  Training AI models are becoming increasingly expensive as the availability of data is saturating and high-quality data acquisition costs are rising. Training the first 'Transformer' model developed by Google, which laid the foundation for ChatGPT, cost around USD 930 dollars. In stark contrast, training OpenAI's GPT-4 cost the company USD 78.4 million, while the costs incurred by Google for training Gemini Ultra stood at USD 191.4 million 37 . As costs are only expected to go up, developers have been exploring the idea of using 'Synthetic Data', but this is rife with its own set of challenges. Artificially generated data come with data distribution bias, are characterised by completeness which influences the model's resilience, can contain many inaccuracies and errors, can neglect temporal and dynamic aspects found in real data and are highly inconsistent when evaluated on factors present in real data 38 . Utilising synthetic data to augment previous training data leads to the model's learning essentially coming to a halt and repeated use of synthetic data leads to 'model collapse'.

13.40  Secondly, developing more sophisticated models comes with significant costs as well. Since processing user queries utilises vast computational resources, AI firms incur running costs for the model. For instance, in the case of OpenAI's o3 model mentioned earlier, the breakthrough in processing capability came at a very high cost. In running the ARC-AGI benchmark, which is considered one of the most challenging tasks for an AI to undertake, OpenAI incurred a cost of USD 200,000 39  for its low-efficiency model. While the firm asked the author not to disclose its high-efficiency cost, the author does state  that  the  amount  to  compute  was  172  times  the  low-efficiency  model's  figure. Running increasingly complex models is computationally tasking, exerting hardware, energy and other resource demands.

13.41 In this regard, AI's energy requirements are no mystery. Globally, all data centres already consume more electricity than countries such as Italy, Taiwan, Australia, Spain and  Malaysia  among  others 40 .  These  requirements  will  only  increase  with  greater adoption.  A  recently  published  Bloomberg  analysis  estimated  that  powering  Data Centres for AI around the world is expected to reach up to 1580 terawatt-hours, which is as much electricity as India consumes 41 . Hardware also needs cooling, which is reliant on water, much of it drinking quality. Cooling is estimated to need over a billion litres of water per day. Further, Data Centre campuses are built on a vast amount of land, and finding the right piece of land that fulfils the power and water requirements is going to drive up land prices in resource-rich areas. The chips powering AI are reliant on a steady supply of minerals such as silicone, gold, silver, aluminium, tin, and other rare earth minerals. The magnitude of scarce resources required for AI proliferation would not be much of a concern if there were no competing needs driving demand for the same resources. However, this is not the case and scaling up AI has the potential to start a bidding war for minerals, land, and water, driving up prices for essential resources.

13.42  Without  ground-breaking  innovations  and  strategies  to  make  AI  scaling economically viable-both financially and in terms of resource consumption-efforts to democratise AI will jeopardise critical global priorities such as energy security, water security, and even housing or food security. The construction of sprawling data centres risks displacing essential land use, further exacerbating these challenges. The imperative for AI developers is clear: scaling down resource consumption while simultaneously boosting performance is not just a technical hurdle but the defining bottleneck that will shape the future of AI. The time to address this pressing issue is now.

13.43  Technological revolutions that achieved mass adoption only did so because, over the  course  of  time,  they  got  the  delicate  mix  of  the  factors  outlined  in  the  previous sections right. Practicality, reliability, infrastructure and efficiency need to all work in tandem before true large scale adoption happens. No amount of investment can force mass adoption unless the technology makes economic sense for the user and for the society. In the case of AI, if it makes sense for the former and not the latter, policymakers have to step in and take some hard decisions.

## AI AND INDIA: ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES?

13.44  As India contemplates the integration of AI into its economy, the lessons of past technological revolutions underscore the critical importance of proactive institutional response. The time afforded now must be well utilised to minimise the adverse effects

to the best of our capabilities involves equipping the workforce with future-ready skill. We must also use this time to put in place mechanisms to cushion societal impacts, a  challenge  that  resonates  deeply  with  India's  unique  demographic  and  economic landscape.

13.45  Looking ahead, the nation's predominantly services-driven economy, coupled with its young and dynamic population, offers a fertile ground for leveraging the benefits of emerging technologies, only if proactively and carefully managed. Technology does not always have to displace labour but instead can be put to use in augmenting the productivity of the workforce. Just as history provides a reason for caution, history also provides a cause for optimism about the effectiveness of strong institutions which can foster an environment where man and machine work together.

13.46  Further, the exposure of medium- to high-skill jobs to AI driven automation may not be as high as certain estimates, due to the inherent limitations of AI as detailed in Box XIII.1. Thus, the labour augmenting potential of AI should also not be ignored.

## Box XIII.1: Demystifying Artificial Intelligence

In the simplest terms, the 'AI' tools on the market today, particularly Generative AI, are statistical models, utilising significant computing power, that are a function of large amounts of text, images, and other forms of data fed into them. The processing of any input is broken down across many layers for the most complex models, with each layer containing several thousand nodes (or neurons 42 ). This combination of layers and nodes allows the model to 'think', 'reason', and process data at unimaginable scales, generating an output along the parameters the model has been trained for.

When you ask any modern chatbot driven by an underlying large language model a simple question  such  as  'Where  does  the  sun  rise  and  set?',  the  model  does  not  interpret  the language in the question as an actual human does. This is because 'AI' has no understanding of the concepts of letters and syllables. The machine processes input text using a series of mathematical computations involving matrices. First, the text is broken into smaller units called tokens in a process known as tokenisation, where each token is mapped to a unique number. For example, the phrase 'AI revolution' might be tokenised to [342, 2591], where these numbers correspond to the indices of the words in the model's vocabulary.

Once  tokenised,  the  model  uses  mechanisms  to  compute  the  frequency  of  token  pairs, triplets,  and  other  sequences  between  each  word  and  all  other  words  in  the  input.  This allows the model to assign importance (weights) to different words based on their context.

42    In  the  1940s,  Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts developed a mathematical model to mimic how the brain processes information. They proposed that neurons in the brain function like switches, turning "on" or "off" based on signals they receive from other neurons. Their model used simple logic, where a neuron activates if the  sum of incoming signals surpasses a certain threshold, similar to binary decision-making in computers. This foundational concept inspired the development of artificial neural networks, computer systems designed to emulate the brain's signal processing for tasks like pattern recognition, decision-making, and problem-solving.

These weighted representations are passed through layers of the neural network, where patterns and relationships are refined. The network output assigns probability values to each possible token, representing how likely each one will appear next. The tokens with the highest probabilities are selected and mapped back to their corresponding words in the vocabulary, generating a coherent text output. The new tokens generated are then fed back into the model, making it appear that the bot is equipped to have a flowing conversation with the user.

Thus, to respond to a user's query, the data analysis performed by the model is essentially a  game  of  'guess  the  next  word'.  In  other  words,  it  is  a  highly  complex  version  of  the autocomplete function we already see on our computers and smartphones. Generative AI are trained to simply predict the next word in a sequence of words by calculating probabilities based on the user input text. Considering the non-linearity and complexity of language, such an exercise is computationally very expensive. To generate a single-line response to the user's question (in our example, 'The sun rises in the east and sets in the west'), the model may need to perform anywhere between 10 to 20 trillion arithmetic operations to generate a 11-word response. Similar principles govern the functioning of other generative AI.

Strides made in AI-research is awe-inspiring and will most likely be helpful in the coming years 43 .  However, Michael Wooldridge from the University of Oxford had suggested that claims of intelligence required more rigorous scrutiny, stating that large language models, despite their dazzling appearance of human-like competence, are not 'AI' 44 . While capable of some superficial logical reasoning and problem-solving, these models are limited in their extended capabilities. Anything additional expected from these models must be explicitly coded into them, which is very different from what is traditionally considered 'intelligent'. To claim that machines are 'learning' is to assign the wrong label since these models use predictive and probabilistic statistics to generate an output.

Consider  an  AI-powered  marketing  tool  that  determines  campaign  success  based  solely on click-through rates and conversions. While efficient, it might ignore brand perception, customer loyalty, and the long-term impact of the campaign on the business. In education, implementing  an  AI-based  grading  system  for  students  that  evaluates  essays  based  on grammar, structure, and word count can be quick and efficient. But the AI may miss the value brought by creativity, originality, and critical thinking expressed in the content.

Along similar lines, AI in healthcare can recommend treatments that prioritise statistical outcomes  since  it  cannot  factor  parameters  such  as  quality  of  life,  patient  preferences, and  ethical  considerations.  Relying  on  AI  for  judicial  decisions  also  involves  risks  since predicting recidivism or determining bail requires balancing subjective considerations such as fairness, individual circumstances, and social impact. Judgements passed in courts are much more than simple prediction tasks and are a product of personal experience combined with domain-specific knowledge, the former of which AI lacks.

43    However,  the  efficiency  of  the  models  is  still  a  research  question  that  remains  unanswered  thus  far  in  the Generative AI community. Larger models drive up the demand for more computational resources and energy, which in turn drives up the cost of running these models.

Advancements in computer science may just as well address these concerns in the future. However, in the meantime, just as machines are designed for specific  tasks  rather  than universal application, AI functions as a tool tailored to particular purposes. This means it is  more suited to supplement human action rather than be a total replacement for work performed by them.

## THE LABOUR MARKET EVOLUTION

13.47  Labour and Technology, when integrated in the right way, have complemented one another rather than being substitutes. Further, technical change did not always lead to declining employment in the affected industry; rather, it has resulted in strong employment growth during the decades the technology was being refined. For instance, Bessen (2018) 45  investigated the impact automated manufacturing had on the textiles, steel, and automotive industries of the United States. The findings demonstrated that productivity gains due to automation led to robust job growth and higher earnings for workers over the course of nearly four decades before plateauing.

13.48  Studies assessing the introduction of robots in factories corroborate the same. While the employment share in routine manual jobs declined due to the adoption of automated robots on the factory floor, this in no way led to capital substituting for labour  in  the  advanced  economies 46 .  Such  effects  were  also  visible  in  developing countries,  where  robots  in  fact  reduced  unemployment  growth  as  robotic  work  and human work integrated with one another over time 47 . Specifically in the case of India, a study by Mani (2018) illustrated how the introduction of robots only accounted for the replacement of only 10 jobs per 10000 in the manufacturing sector by 2016 48 . This was primarily concentrated in automobiles, while the rest of the manufacturing sector remained largely unaffected by automation.

13.49  Similarly,  Albanesi  et  al.  (2024)  introduced  some  much-needed  balance  to the  literature  on  the  effects  of  AI/ML  led  automation  on  white-collar  jobs 49 .  Their assessment of the impact of AI/ML on white-collar jobs in Europe suggests that there exists a positive association between AI-enabled automation as the sector-occupation employment share of high-skilled workers increases in the range of 3.1 per cent to 6.6 per cent over the course of a decade.

13.50  Research  has  already  demonstrated  how  the  introduction  of  generative  AI assistants augmenting customer support personnel increased productivity by 14 per cent on average, including a 34 per cent improvement for new and lower-skilled workers 50 . Employees  were  able  to  substantially  improve  their  problem  resolution,  leading  to higher customer satisfaction. Cogito, a customer support firm, has been encouraging the use of AI assistants, which are able to analyse customer sentiments and provide real-time  feedback  to  customer  support  representatives,  improving  the  efficiency  of issue resolution. Implementing AI as a tool helps bridge the skill gap in this domain, allowing low-skilled workers to produce outputs closer in quality to the work highskilled workers do without any tools. The reduction in skill inequality is a big positive on aggregate since the overall productivity increases.

13.51 In more complex fields such as scientific research, Human-AI teams are able to  generate  high-quality  outputs  by  capitalising  on  the  best  of  human  and  machine intelligence. For instance, Charness et al. (2023) find that AI-assisted research design benefits in five core aspects: Questions and Literature, generating testable hypotheses and  methodologies  for  testing,  instructions  and  comprehension  checks,  generating experimental code and related documentation, and auditing for errors 51 . Prof. Noshir Contractor of Northwestern University also cites several other instances in his research where AI-enabled researchers benefitted from the capacity of the machine for processing vast  amounts of scientific  data  for  hypothesis  generation,  enhanced  data  collection, manuscript review, and meta-analysis, among others 52 .

13.52  Supplementing human decision-making with AI assistants would be the ideal and the most desirable outcome for maximising the micro- and macroeconomic benefits of the technology. This is what the leading AI firms seek to achieve as well. In his most recent blog, Sam Altman (the co-founder of OpenAI) stated that their intentions are to put 'great tools in the hands of people', with the goal of achieving broadly distributed outcomes 53 .  Similarly,  in  Alphabet  Inc.'s  2024  Q3  earnings  call,  the  CEO  of  Google stated that the company internally is using AI to augment their engineers' productivity by automating low level tasks, which allows their people to focus on more complex tasks 54 .

13.53  Further,  factors  such  as  accountability,  an  understanding  of  the  subjective and  practical  realities  of  the  world,  consistently  adapting  reasoning,  cognisance  of

consequences,  and  critical  thinking  are  all  important  factors  which  human  capital brings  to  any  enterprise.  Replacing  authentic,  intelligent  deliberation  with  a  brutal, calculative algorithm will result in a society where algorithms serve as an escape from reason, an excuse not to think. AI must be seen for and utilised as what it is supposed to be, a tool, as the arc of technological history does not bend towards the replacement of humans by machines.

## AUGMENTING INDIA'S SERVICES SECTOR

13.54  India  is  a  services-driven  economy,  and  the  opportunities  for  enhancing  the productivity of the workforce are ample. Further, the younger population of the country makes a rich talent pool available for capitalising on emerging technologies. This is significant  because  the  study  by  Albanesi  et  al.  (2024)  analysing  the  effects  of  AI/ ML implementation in Europe revealed that youth and high-skilled workers were the demographic most capable of understanding and adapting to technological changes 55 .

13.55 Education and skilling are going to play a critical role in driving the success of human-centric AI adoption in the country while minimising labour displacement as best we can. If history has taught us anything, it is that with each subsequent technological revolution, the floor for what is considered a basic skill has risen. As automation handles the routine and mundane tasks, the mind is now free to focus on more complex questions and  issues,  thus  raising  skill  requirements.  The  Industrial  Revolution  demanded  a labour force skilled in handling factory machines and engineers who maintained them. The Age of Steam and Railways shifted the employment landscape towards industrial and urban jobs, primarily in construction, operations and maintenance. The Age of Steel, Electricity and Heavy Engineering demanded a workforce capable of handling large-scale machinery, electrical equipment and several other jobs in the technical fields. With the Information and Telecommunications era, jobs shifted towards knowledgebased and service-oriented jobs.

13.56  As  developments  in  the  field  of  AI  create  tools  capable  of  automating  basic knowledge creation and processing, skills such as critical thinking, higher degrees of creativity, and the capacity for more specialised knowledge may well be the new normal. Thus, India's employment challenge is not just about numbers but also about raising the overall 'quality' of the workforce. Quality in this case does not just mean imparting knowledge through a step-by-step guide to leveraging AI, or providing very specific training related to 'AI oriented jobs.' Technology specific skills run the risk of becoming obsolete very soon, especially in today's world where the requirements shift rapidly.

55    Albanesi, S., Dias da Silva, A., Jimeno, J. F., Lamo, A., &amp; Wabitsch, A. (2024). New technologies and jobs in Europe. Economic Policy, eiae058, https://tinyurl.com/yjn8y9ju

13.57 In addition to the above, improvements in the quality of the workforce must focus on more foundational skills as well, such as soft skills and core competencies which are valuable across industries and roles. Foundational skills support the learning of tech-specific skills by fostering adaptability and cognitive agility and are significantly more resistant to the risk of becoming obsolete. The silver lining is that due to the R&amp;D nature of AI, India, this time, has the opportunity to catch up with, if not get ahead of the curve and prepare its workforce.

13.58  Furthermore,  Bessen  (2018) 56   finds  that  technological  change  is  only  labour displacing and brings about mass unemployment if the demand for the product/service offered by the industry is saturated. If the market has large, unmet needs, then labour augmented by machines increases productivity and employment. This implies that new technology should increase employment if the demand elasticity for the sector is high.

## Box XIII.2: Connecting the dots - Employment, automation and demand-elasticities

What happens to work in the presence of automation? Often automation does away with sub-tasks  within  a  job,  in  turn  leading  to  a  modification  of  the  job  profile  than  the  job being  suppressed  entirely  (ILO,2019) 57 .  The  role  of  a  bank-teller  over  time  exemplifies how automation leads to new sub-tasks being taken up alongside other routine, so far unautomated work. For instance, the introduction of labour-saving innovations such as the ATM did not lead to a loss of bank employment. Rather bank employment has grown, and the role of the bank teller has shifted from clerical work to sales and counselling over time (Bessen, 2015) 58 .

Ultimately, the capacity of a sector to create jobs in response to automation depends on whether  the  new  grouping  of  sub-tasks  into  specific  job  profiles  is  deemed  profitable (ILO,2019).  This  is  in  turn  a  function  of  the  demand  for  particular  services  delivered than the supply of skills to fill these jobs (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011 59 ; Bessen, 2018 60 ). Understanding the nature of demand for a particular sector can therefore reveal clues as to how the sector will respond to technological change.

To gauge the employment impact of a technological revolution, it makes sense to look at how employment in the past responded to the industrial revolution of the early 20th century.

Gleaning insights from the days of the industrial revolution, Bessen (2018) 61  looks at data since the 1930s for the US cotton, steel, motor vehicle and textile industries. He finds that technological change is only labour displacing and brings about mass unemployment if the demand for the product/service offered by the industry is saturated. If the market has large, unmet needs, then labour augmented by machines increases productivity and employment. This implies that new technology should increase employment if the demand elasticity for the sector is high.

While some level of worker displacement is inevitable for those unable to align with shifting skill  requirements,  the  scale  of  this  displacement  is  shaped  by  the  interplay  between displacement effects and productivity gains. For instance, in highly demand-elastic markets, the "reinstatement effect" has historically acted as a counterbalance against the displacement effect caused by automation. Technological advancements in markets with unmet demand often give rise to auxiliary tasks where labour maintains a competitive edge. As Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019) 62  observe, such tasks not only enhance productivity but also reinstate labor into a broader spectrum of roles, thereby altering the task composition of production in labor's favor.

## Elasticities for India's services sectors - An estimation

As established in the section before, demand elasticities can help gauge a sector's ability to raise employment because of productivity enhancements from automation. As shown by Bessen (2018), the per capita real demand for a sector (D) can be written as a function of real wages (w) and real prices (p). This is shown by equation (1)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This can also be re-written 63 as,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where A denotes labour productivity and s is the labour share of income

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Further the elasticity of demand with respect to labour productivity can then be interpreted as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

On the right-hand side, ϵ D is the price elasticity of demand while the partial derivate shows the  influence  of  productivity  on  labour's  share  of  output.  The  equation  shows  that  price elasticity of demand and productivity elasticity of demand are positively correlated.

63  Since share of income can be re-written as s = = wL w

To understand the potential for employment increases in India's services sector, Bessen (2019)'s theoretical model is replicated with the help of data from RBI's KLEMS database. The data studied is for the period of 1994 to 2023. The demand elasticities estimated for India's services sectors (based on the classification provided by RBI KLEMS) 64  are shown by chart XIII.1. Note that elasticities for transport services and hotel services were insignificant at the 10 per cent level and are hence not depicted in the chart.

<!-- image -->

As the estimates show, the financial sector shows the highest elasticity at 1.86 followed by Health  and  social  work  (1.3),  Retail  and  wholesale  trade  (1.2),  Business  services  (1.08), Education (0.77) and post and telecom (0.32). It must be noted that the elasticity estimation is at a broad level which does not consider aspects such as product quality. Further, since the classification is sufficiently broad (i.e, industries instead of sectors), it may well be that sub-sectors within the industry show higher or lower elasticities than the industry average.

## Implication for the services sector in India

A sectoral comparison of estimates reveals that demand elasticities are high for sectors such as financial services, trade services, health and social work and business services.

The high elasticity in financial services could be indicative that the sector is yet to reach a stage of market saturation. Productivity enhancement may therefore prove employment generating for the financial sector. Research also corroborates that information technology improvements tend to raise employment in finance, retail and wholesale industries 65 .

High  elasticities  in  the  health  and  social  work  industry  shows  that  automation  can  aid productivity and employment gains in this sector. For instance, as research by Shwalbe and

Wahl, 2020 66   shows,  AI  can  aid  productivity  through  interventions  in  diagnosis,  patient mortality risk assessment, disease outbreak prediction and health policy and planning. In the social work industry, AI can maximise the effectiveness of frontline workers.

The  high  elasticity  in  retail  and  wholesale  trade  in  the  country  is  indicative  of  a  large consumption  base  in  the  country.  Thus,  effective  productivity  gains  are  likely  to  make it  profitable  for  new  roles  to  co-exist  with  automated  tasks  on  average  for  this  industry. Productivity gains for businesses engaged in retail and wholesale activities include identifying customer  preferences,  enhanced  marketing  techniques  and  inventory  management  and forecasting.

The business sector is a export-oriented sector with activities such as IT and IT enabled services, R&amp;D services in the areas such as accounting and legal professions. The sector's elastic demand shows that, on average, services employment may rise in the presence of AI for this particular sector. However, it should be noted that the elasticity estimate does not give a picture of sub-sector elasticities. It is possible then for employment in lower valueadded sub-sectors in the industry (such as Business Process Outsourcing Units) to respond negatively to automation as compared to higher value-added sub-sectors (such as Global Capability Centers).

The education sector shows an inelastic demand for services. Theoretically, this may imply that productivity enhancements through AI-based learning models can lead to a decline in teacher employment. For instance, there maybe a reduction in the need for personnel as a result of cost-effective access to high quality interactive learning media, and customised learning paths for students. However, the essential nature of the service and its high degree of regulation are likely to act as buffers which will ensure that productivity improvements will not come at the expense of teacher employment.

Interestingly, post and telecom also show low elasticity. This sector in particular has reached a  high  degree  of  market  saturation  over  the  past  three  decades.  The  oligopolistic  nature of the industry may also imply that increases in labour productivity may come with lower costs which would translate to higher profit margins (and not necessarily lower prices). A high degree of market saturation and oligopolist market structure imply that prices may not reflect declining costs. Automation may therefore behave as a labour-displacing force than a labour augmenting one.

13.59  While initial displacement is to be expected for workers who fail to catch up to the market demands, the magnitude of displacement also depends on how displacement and productivity effects weigh against each other 67 . For a sufficiently demand-elastic market,  the  displacement  effects  historically  have  been  counterbalanced  by  the 'reinstatement effect'. Demand for new products and services due to new technology in a market with unmet demand has created new, auxiliary tasks where labour has a

competitive advantage. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019) state that, 'such new tasks not only generate a positive productivity effect, but also a reinstatement effect - reinstating labour into a broader range of tasks and thus change the task content of production in favour of labour. This increases labour demand and labour share.'

13.60  Looking  at  the  history  of  the  labour  market  through  this  lens,  we  can  now decode why, despite major new technologies that automated economic value addition, the employment-to-population ratio rose over the 20th century 68 . Along these lines, the  future  of  work  is  'Augmented  Intelligence',  one  that  expands  the  workforce  to accommodate both humans and machines, with the aim of improving humanity while also bringing about a greater level of efficiency in how we perform our jobs 69 .

13.61 What new opportunities will emerge from the spillover effects of AI will only be clear once AI goes from experimental to practical, but reinforcing the point made earlier, it is up to policymakers, academia, and the private sector to work together to raise the overall quality of human capital in India. This tripartite compact is also going to be instrumental in ensuring that the gains from productivity are distributed widely creating  a  social  surplus,  rather  than  concentrating  in  the  hands  of  an  increasingly oligopolistic sector 70 .

## CONCLUSION

13.62  In the seven decades since the development of Artificial Intelligence began, the progress made in the last decade lays down an important milestone for the domain. While impressive in its own right, AI still remains in its developmental stage and has a long way to go before it achieves the scope of adoption that have made technologies such as the personal computer and the internet ubiquitous. The scale of challenges left unaddressed are significant, and so is the time required by developers to come up with cost-effective and resource-efficient solutions. Therefore, as the essay suggested, estimates about the magnitude of labour market impacts may be well above what might actually materialise. Nevertheless, complacency about the 'low probability-high impact' nature of the issue at hand could prove to be very costly for a country like India.

13.63  As policymakers, it would benefit us to ask ourselves the question, 'What were the problems in the world that demanded AI as the answer?' In other words, is AI a solution in search of a problem? This question is not easily answered as innovation does

not always respond to a problem, rather emerges as a product of human ingenuity. Thus, in some sense, AI represents the human drive for improvement, for creating something previously thought impossible. However, when innovation has the possibility of coming at great societal cost, the value of innovation must then be judged in the context of its potential loss generation.

13.64  Despite the limitations of AI and the pre-requisites necessary for its widespread application,  it  is  worth  taking  notice  of  the  fact  that  labour  markets  are  shifting  at present in anticipation of a distant future. Nobody knows how long these changes may last,  but  they  can  definitely  leave  a  lasting  impact  on  the  physical  and  mental  wellbeing of those affected.  The responsibility for course correction will then fall in the hands of the public sector. Therefore, from a policymaker's perspective, it may be costly to  dismiss  fears  as  exaggerated  and  adverse  impacts  as  overestimated.  Rather,  they underscore the need for constant vigil and timely action.

13.65  Learning from the lessons of the past, capacity building and institution building is the need of the hour for India to capitalise on the opportunity that lies ahead. Structural changes to how we educate our children will be required in addition to safety nets that can shield existing workers from economic and social fallouts. Additionally, regulatory frameworks will need to be revisited and amended to ensure that the use of AI aligns with  societal  values,  balancing  innovation  with  accountability  and  transparency. However, regulations will go only thus far.

13.66  The  corporate  sector  has  to  display  a  high  degree  of  social  responsibility. Although  the  impact  of  AI  on  labour  will  be  felt  across  the  world,  the  problem  is magnified for India, given its size and its relatively low per capita income. If companies do not optimise the introduction of AI over a longer horizon and do not handle it with sensitivity, the demand for policy intervention and the demand on fiscal resources to compensate will be irresistible. The state, in turn, has to resort to taxation of profits generated from the replacement of labour with technology to mobilise those resources, as the IMF suggested in its paper 71 . It will leave everyone worse off and the country's growth potential will suffer, as a result.

13.67 Utilising this window of time available during the nascent stages of AI to build robust institutions can ensure that we, as a nation, are well placed to minimise the costs as much as possible. This can then help tilt the scale towards the benefits, bringing a balance to the 'cost-benefit' aspect in a labour driven, services dependent economy like India.

agents of the economy. A tripartite compact between the government, private sector and academia can ensure that the gains from AI-driven productivity are widely distributed, taking  us  in  the  direction  of  the  ideal  inclusive  growth  strategy.  The  probability  of success in this endeavour is directly proportional to the appreciation of the enormity of the challenge and the gravity of the consequences of failure.
