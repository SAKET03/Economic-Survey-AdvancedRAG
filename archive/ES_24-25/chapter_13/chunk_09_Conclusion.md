## CONCLUSION

13.62  In the seven decades since the development of Artificial Intelligence began, the progress made in the last decade lays down an important milestone for the domain. While impressive in its own right, AI still remains in its developmental stage and has a long way to go before it achieves the scope of adoption that have made technologies such as the personal computer and the internet ubiquitous. The scale of challenges left unaddressed are significant, and so is the time required by developers to come up with cost-effective and resource-efficient solutions. Therefore, as the essay suggested, estimates about the magnitude of labour market impacts may be well above what might actually materialise. Nevertheless, complacency about the 'low probability-high impact' nature of the issue at hand could prove to be very costly for a country like India.

13.63  As policymakers, it would benefit us to ask ourselves the question, 'What were the problems in the world that demanded AI as the answer?' In other words, is AI a solution in search of a problem? This question is not easily answered as innovation does

not always respond to a problem, rather emerges as a product of human ingenuity. Thus, in some sense, AI represents the human drive for improvement, for creating something previously thought impossible. However, when innovation has the possibility of coming at great societal cost, the value of innovation must then be judged in the context of its potential loss generation.

13.64  Despite the limitations of AI and the pre-requisites necessary for its widespread application,  it  is  worth  taking  notice  of  the  fact  that  labour  markets  are  shifting  at present in anticipation of a distant future. Nobody knows how long these changes may last,  but  they  can  definitely  leave  a  lasting  impact  on  the  physical  and  mental  wellbeing of those affected.  The responsibility for course correction will then fall in the hands of the public sector. Therefore, from a policymaker's perspective, it may be costly to  dismiss  fears  as  exaggerated  and  adverse  impacts  as  overestimated.  Rather,  they underscore the need for constant vigil and timely action.

13.65  Learning from the lessons of the past, capacity building and institution building is the need of the hour for India to capitalise on the opportunity that lies ahead. Structural changes to how we educate our children will be required in addition to safety nets that can shield existing workers from economic and social fallouts. Additionally, regulatory frameworks will need to be revisited and amended to ensure that the use of AI aligns with  societal  values,  balancing  innovation  with  accountability  and  transparency. However, regulations will go only thus far.

13.66  The  corporate  sector  has  to  display  a  high  degree  of  social  responsibility. Although  the  impact  of  AI  on  labour  will  be  felt  across  the  world,  the  problem  is magnified for India, given its size and its relatively low per capita income. If companies do not optimise the introduction of AI over a longer horizon and do not handle it with sensitivity, the demand for policy intervention and the demand on fiscal resources to compensate will be irresistible. The state, in turn, has to resort to taxation of profits generated from the replacement of labour with technology to mobilise those resources, as the IMF suggested in its paper 71 . It will leave everyone worse off and the country's growth potential will suffer, as a result.

13.67 Utilising this window of time available during the nascent stages of AI to build robust institutions can ensure that we, as a nation, are well placed to minimise the costs as much as possible. This can then help tilt the scale towards the benefits, bringing a balance to the 'cost-benefit' aspect in a labour driven, services dependent economy like India.  Navigating  this  transformation  necessitate  coordinated  participation  from  all

agents of the economy. A tripartite compact between the government, private sector and academia can ensure that the gains from AI-driven productivity are widely distributed, taking  us  in  the  direction  of  the  ideal  inclusive  growth  strategy.  The  probability  of success in this endeavour is directly proportional to the appreciation of the enormity of the challenge and the gravity of the consequences of failure.
