## EXTERNAL SECTOR: GETTING FDI RIGHT

03

India's external sector continued to display resilience amidst global headwinds of  economic  and  trade  policy  uncertainties.  Total  exports  (merchandise  and services)  have  registered  a  steady  growth  in  the  first  nine  months  of  FY25, reaching USD 602.6 billion (6 per cent). Growth in services and goods exports, excluding petroleum and gems and jewellery, was 10.4 per cent. Total imports during the same period reached USD 682.2 billion, registering a growth of 6.9 per cent on the back of steady domestic demand.

The evolving global trade dynamics, marked by gradual shifts towards greater protectionism,  require  assessing  the  situation  and  developing  a  forwardlooking strategic trade roadmap. By adapting to these trends and leveraging its strengths, India can accelerate its growth and enhance its presence in global trade. To strengthen its competitiveness and further integrate into global supply chains, the country can focus on reducing trade-related costs and enhancing export  facilitation  to  create  a  more  vibrant  export  sector.  This  proactive approach will help India continue to thrive in an ever-changing global market.

On  the  capital  front,  foreign  portfolio  investments  (FPIs)  have  shown  a mixed  trend  in  FY25  so  far.  Uncertainty  in  the  global  markets  and  profittaking by foreign portfolio investors led to capital outflows. However, strong macroeconomic fundamentals, a  favourable  business  environment,  and  high economic  growth  have  kept  FPI  flows  positive  overall.  Gross  foreign  direct investment (FDI) inflows have shown signs of revival in the first eight months of FY25, though net FDI inflows declined relative to April-November 2023 due to a rise in repatriation/disinvestment.

India's foreign exchange reserves stood at USD 640.3 billion as of the end of December 2024, sufficient to cover approximately 90 per cent of the country's external  debt  of  USD  711.8  billion  as  of  September  2024,  reflecting  a  strong buffer against external vulnerabilities.

## INTRODUCTION

3.1 The world is experiencing increasing political and economic uncertainty in the wake of geopolitical  conflicts,  increasing  trends  of  geoeconomic  fragmentation,  and recurrent climate events. The Great Election year of 2024, during which more than half of the world's population was exercising their franchise to elect their new governments, meant further declining policy predictability. Such political and economic uncertainty can be detrimental to growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that a one standard deviation increase in uncertainty correlates with a 0.4 to 1.3 percentage point  decrease  in  output  growth. 1 Economists  like  Keynes  and  Tobin  have  pointed out that higher uncertainty requires investors to seek more significant compensation for  risks,  thereby  raising  risk  premia  and  the  overall  cost  of  finance.  Additionally, uncertainty  increases  the  likelihood  of  borrower  defaults,  leading  to  higher  capital costs. Moreover, uncertainty shocks in advanced economies like the US have often led to lower output and reduced prices. 2

3.2 Various indicators are used to monitor global risks and uncertainties and measure policy-related  uncertainty's  impact  on  global  economic  activity.  These  include  the Geopolitical  Risk  (GPR)  index 3 ,  which  tracks  adverse  geopolitical  events  through newspaper  articles;  the  Trade  Policy  Uncertainty  (TPU)  index 4 ,  which  covers  the frequency of articles mentioning trade policy uncertainty and heightened trade tensions, and the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty (GEPU) index 5 , which is a GDP-weighted average of national Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) indices for 21 countries. These indices capture changes occurring in economies constituting about 71 per cent of global output. 6

3.3 These indices provide valuable insights into how uncertainty from trade issues, geopolitical  events,  and  economic  policy  measures  can  impact  global  economic conditions. As of November 2024, the GEPU index remains high, reflecting ongoing global economic policy concerns. Similarly, the TPU index has risen since December 2023, primarily driven by trade tensions and policy changes among major economies.

3.4 The  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  has  developed  a  policy  uncertainty  index specifically  for  India,  utilising  various  global  indices.  This  index  leverages  internet search  data  from  Google  Trends  to  assess  policy  uncertainty  from  domestic  and international events. Furthermore, the index is updated in real-time. 7,8

3.5 With  this  backdrop,  the  chapter  presents  the  performance  of  India's  external sector  amidst  the  prevailing  global  environment.  Section  I  provides  an  overview  of the global trade dynamics, emphasising tariffs and non-tariff measures (NTMs) and the performance of the global external sector amidst challenges. Section II delves into India's trade performance, highlighting the trends across both the merchandise and services sectors. It examines the performance of India's textile exports and the factors restricting its global expansion. Further, a detailed analysis of India's diversification in exports to new markets has been presented. The key drivers and challenges affecting India's e-commerce export growth are also discussed in depth. Section III discusses the factors restricting export growth and outlines the government initiatives to simplify export procedures to enhance trade performance. Section IV presents India's Balance of Payments (BoP) situation, highlighting current and capital account trends, foreign exchange reserves, exchange rate movements, and India's external debt position. The last section concludes the chapter with an outlook for India's external sector, considering the evolving global and domestic economic landscape.

7   When faced with heightened uncertainty, it is typical of economic agents to 'search' for more information. The Google Trends-based uncertainty index (India-GUI) leverages this behaviour to measure overall uncertainty by using internet search volumes for a list of keywords about fiscal, monetary and trade policy in India. The policyrelated keywords are curated, based on mentions in central bank policy statements as well as coverage in the financial press.

## GLOBAL TRADE DYNAMICS

3.6 Disruptions in the Red Sea that began in November 2023 have forced changes in trade routes, causing higher shipping costs and longer delivery times. 9 This is particularly true for trade between Asia and Europe, as 40 per cent of this trade passes through the Red Sea region. 10  Similar conflicts in the Hormuz Strait, which channels 21 per cent of global petroleum liquid consumption, have disrupted energy trade and increased prices. Additionally, climate change is enhancing the uncertainties. 11  For instance, the recent drought in the Panama Canal jeopardised international trade, affecting approximately 5 per cent of global maritime trade volumes that transit through it. These conditions are creating uncertainty, leading to a slowdown in international trade, 12  reshaping the contours of trade in terms of a rise in protectionist trade policies and shifting global supply chains.

- 3.7 As evident from Chart III.2, there has been a noticeable rise in the political proximity of trade since late 2022. This indicates a preference for bilateral trade between countries with similar geopolitical stances, i.e., friend-shoring 13 and nearshoring. 14  Concurrently, there has been an increasing concentration of global trade 15  to favour significant trade relationships. For instance, Russia and China's trade dependence on the EU and the US's dependence on China has declined in recent years. In contrast, the dependence of Russia and Vietnam on China has increased. 16,17
- 3.8 Government interventions, including NTMs, reinforce the change in bilateral trade patterns due to geopolitical considerations. The rise in NTMs, which began after the COVID-19 pandemic, was further fuelled by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. A report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 18 indicates that technical NTMs impact over 30 per cent of products and nearly 70 per cent of global trade. This is discussed further in paras 3.15 to 3.20 of this chapter.

## Global trade performance in 2024

3.9 According to the latest trade update by UNCTAD 19 , the gradual increase in global trade that began in H2 of 2023 has persisted into 2024. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) database shows a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 3.5 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, in global merchandise export and import indices in Q3 of 2024 (seasonally adjusted, 2005 Q1=100). Further, the global services exports and imports grew by 7.9 per cent and 6.7 per cent (YoY) during the same period.

3.10 Over the last four quarters, trade growth in developing countries generally exceeded that  of  developed  nations.  However,  this  trend  reversed  in  Q3  of  2024,  with  positive developments in developed economies driving trade growth. In contrast, trade growth in East Asia stalled, and several major Asian developing economies experienced negative growth.

3.11  According  to  the  UNCTAD  nowcast 20 ,  the  positive  momentum  in  global  trade witnessed in the first three quarters of 2024 is expected to continue into Q4. As a result, global trade is set to exceed its 2022 record, reaching nearly USD 33 trillion in 2024. This record high is likely to be driven by a 7 per cent increase in services trade (YoY), while goods trade is projected to grow by about 2 per cent in 2024 but remain below its 2022 peak. Overall, global trade is expected to expand by about USD 1 trillion (or 3.3 per cent) in 2024, with goods and services contributing approximately USD 500 billion each.

## Tariff policies

3.12 To promote free trade, encourage investment, and lower trading costs, countries worldwide have established various trade agreements. The number of regional trade agreements (RTAs) in effect has grown substantially, increasing from 22 in 1990 to 369 as of August 2024. 21  Increased emphasis on free trade and enhanced collaboration in international trade policies under the WTO has reduced border tariffs among nations. For instance, between 2000 and 2024, the average tariff rates on dutiable items in India  decreased  from  48.9  per  cent  to  17.3  per  cent,  while  in  China,  they  fell  from 16.4 per cent to 8.3 per cent. 22   Commodity-wise, between 2012 and 2022, the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) and preferential tariffs declined in agriculture, manufacturing, and natural resources. Globally, the simple average MFN and preferential tariffs for agriculture dropped by approximately 3 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, between 2012 and 2022. The simple average preferential tariffs decreased by about 1 per cent in the manufacturing sector.

3.13 At a broader level, India's import tariff policy has evolved over time, balancing domestic policy goals with the need to integrate into the global economy. Tariffs vary by sector, with considerations like protecting sensitive sectors from foreign competition and permitting access to important raw materials and intermediate goods. India has ensured that tariff policies comply with WTO rules and regulations. Over time, several efforts have been made to rationalise tariffs further and address the inverted duty structures.

3.14 Tariffs  are  often  perceived  to  have  an  impact  on  competitiveness.  However,  if used in a calibrated way, tariffs can aid the goals of industrial policy and help in the development of desirable sectors in the economy (Box III.1).

## Box III.1: Tariffs and successful industrial policy design

Industrial policy refers to measures that target the transformation of an industry in pursuit of a public goal. Tariffs are a standard tool of industrial policy and are often seen as a way to support fledgling industries before they gain traction. However, using tariffs requires a calibrated approach which balances the sector's needs with the costs imposed on the rest of the economy. Tariffs can also be viewed as a lever within a system of tools that can further the goals of industrialisation.

The use of tariffs in industrial policy can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution. Tariffs were commonly used in Western Europe and North America to catch up with the British industrial revolution. As Matthew C. Klein and Michael Pettis note in their book 'Trade wars are class wars',

'Freidrich List, who moved from Germany to America in 1825, wrote that a country such as Germany, which was less developed but 'possesses the mental and material means' to become wealthy, should instead avoid free trade and 'strengthen her own individual powers.' â¦ The United States levied tariffs on manufactured goods of about 45 per cent from 1870 through 1913â¦American manufacturers were protected from foreigners but competed within the large-and expanding-domestic market.'

This accords with the observations made by Professor Robert C. Allen on the development history  of  Europe  and  North  America 23 .  According  to  him,  North  America  and  Western Continental  Europe  caught  up  with  the  British  industrial  revolution  by  adopting  the following:

-     Internal free market (elimination of internal tariffs)-national single market
-   Stable domestic banking system
-   High external tariff
-   Universal Education
-   Infrastructure.

They did not catch up with Britain practising free trade and open capital markets.

Globally,  modern-day  industrial  policies  use  a  mix  of  policies,  including  tariff-based protection and other levers such as credit grants and export-related subsidies. 24  Illustrative of this fact, tariffs accounted for just 1.3 per cent of all industrial policy interventions between 2010 and 2022. 25

Lessons in successful industrial policy design can be gleaned from the support the Korean government extended to its heavy chemicals industry in the Seventies. Korean industrial policy in the heavy chemicals sector led to significant gains in output, labour productivity and long-term comparative advantage of the industry's exports. Tools such as tariff-based protection and quantitative restrictions were used for a limited period, after which protection

tapered in the 1980s. 26  Importantly, in Korea, tariffs were only one element of a composite industrial policy which sought to protect domestic industry and, at the same time, demanded a reciprocal performance obligation on the part of the industry receiving protection.

The  recipe  for  a  successful  industrial  policy  lies  in  the  simultaneous  use  of  carrots  and sticks, with the sticks often being longer than the carrots. Taking a comprehensive look at the industrial policies of Northeast Asia, Joe Studwell wrote in 'How Asia Works' that the region succeeded with its industrial policy because it punished non-performers more than it rewarded performers. As Studwell notes, the emphasis on infant industry protection in Northeast Asian economies went hand in hand with external benchmarking through export performance. There were special privileges for local businesses, but there was accountability for  export  performance.  That  is  how  scale,  productivity,  efficiency  and  rapid  economic growth were achieved. Studwell repeatedly notes that Korean industrial policy punished its non-performers more than helped performers.

To summarise, the growth experiences of the industrialised West and the miracle growth economies of the East suggest that tariffs were indeed a prominent tool used to further industrialisation. However, tariffs were used in a calibrated way, and a whole-of-government approach  was  adopted  in  crafting  tariff  policies.  Finally,  industrial  policy  goals  were achieved not by protection alone but by policies which ensured that the protected industries performed in response to the protection afforded.

## Non-tariff measures

3.15   The decline in tariffs globally, as discussed above, has been accompanied by an increase in the implementation of NTMs 27  across countries. The Global Trade Alert database 28   shows that between 2020 and 2024, over 26,000 new restrictions related to  trade  and  investments  have  been  globally  imposed.  This  is  further  elucidated  in Chapter 5. The Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) affect 31.6 per cent of the product lines, covering 67.1 per cent of the global trade (as of December 2024). This is followed by export-related measures, affecting 19.3 per cent of the product lines and covering 31.2 per cent of the global trade. Sectors most affected by NTMs include agriculture, manufacturing, and natural resources. 29

26    Lane,  N  (2022).  'Manufacturing  revolutions:  industrial  policy  and  industrialization  in  South  Korea',  CSAE Working Paper Series, (https://tinyurl.com/ye2ahh7k).

27    UNCTAD  defines  NTMs  as  policy  measures  that  are  not  ordinary  customs  tariffs  but  can  still  significantly impact  international  trade  in  goods.  These  measures  can  affect  either  the  quantities  traded,  prices,  or  both (Classification  of  NTMs  |  UNCTAD).  NTMs  are  classified  into  import-related  and  export-related  categories based on the above classification. Import-related NTMs are further classified as 'technical' or 'non-technical.' Technical measures comprise sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), technical barriers to trade (TBT), and pre-shipment inspections. Non-technical measures encompass traditional trade policies like quotas, subsidies,

and trade remedies, including those addressing unfair trade practices. In 2006, the UNCTAD established the Group of Eminent Persons on Non-tariff Barriers (NTBs) and the MultiAgency Support Team (MAST) comprising eight international organisations such as the IMF, OECD, UNIDO), UNCTAD, the World Bank and WTO etc. Over the years, MAST has created a coding system as a foundation for  collecting  and  tallying  NTMs.  The  objective  of  the  International  Classification  of  NTMs  (refer:  UNCTAD report on International Classification of Non-Tariff Measures, https://tinyurl.com/mr3mp5uk) was to provide

information and clarification on new and existing measures and to improve their comparability across countries.

The frequency index is defined as the percentage of HS 6-digit lines covered. The coverage ratio is defined as the percentage of trade that is subject to NTMs

3.16   Globally,  NTMs,  such  as  subsidies  and  export-related  measures,  have  risen  in aid of nations' industrial policy goals. 30   Unlike broad-based tariffs, NTMs tend to be granular in their approach. 31 They are often less visible, making them harder to assess. 32

3.17    A  report  by  UNCTAD and the UNESCAP 33  shows evidence of increased use of NTMs by countries  to  adapt  and  mitigate  climate  change.  According  to  the  report, although climate change-related NTMs account for only 2.6 per cent of total measures, they  are  concentrated  in  some  of  the  largest  and  most  CO2-intensive  trade  sectors, such as the automotive industry, electricity and heat generation, transformation, and storage. As a result, 26.4 per cent of global trade, valued at USD 6.5 trillion, is covered by climate-change-related NTMs. TBT comprise over 61 per cent of all identified climate change-related NTMs, followed by export-related and price-control measures (as of December 2024). In the future, the imposition of climate-change-related NTMs by the EU in the form of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) 34  and European

34    CBAM is the EU's tool to put a fair price on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon-intensive goods that are entering the EU and to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries.

Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) 35  is anticipated to have broad implications for  exporters  in  emerging  economies such as China, India, and Turkey. 36 Box  III.2 discusses CBAM and EUDR and their possible impact on India's exports in detail.

## Box III.2: CBAM and EUDR and their likely impact on India's exports

## Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

Implemented by the EU and under consideration by the UK, CBAM aims to align the cost of carbon emissions for imported goods with that of domestically produced products. As countries/groups  like  the  EU  phase  out  the  free  allowances  they  offer  their  industries under the Emissions Trading System (ETS), they are ushering in CBAM to prevent their consumption from shifting to countries with relatively softer environmental regulations. Under the mechanism, importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price paid by the domestic producers/manufacturers under the EU's carbon pricing rules. Thus, CBAM is effectively a carbon price equalisation measure.

The key sectors covered under the EU CBAM include iron and steel, aluminium, cement, and fertilisers. Reporting requirements for the EU CBAM began on 1 January 2024, with quarterly submissions for the previous quarter. The levy, however, is expected to take effect from 1 January 2026. The UK has also proposed its own CBAM, scheduled to come into force on 1 January 2027, reflecting a broader global shift towards carbon pricing mechanisms. The key sectors covered under the UK CBAM include cement, fertilisers, glass, ceramics, iron and steel, aluminium, and hydrogen. Currently, the EU CBAM addresses only direct emissions from production processes, whereas the proposed UK CBAM intends to cover both direct and indirect emissions. CBAM aims to equalise carbon prices across geographies, thereby negating the comparative advantage of developing members like India and the least developed countries.

The justification offered for the introduction of CBAM is that it prevents carbon leakage. 37 Some jurisdictions believe that the aggregate impact of the countries' nationally determined contributions, if fully implemented, would not put the world on a pathway to achieving the Paris Agreement goal. Therefore, the logic behind CBAM is that as long as they did not have the same level of ambition, CBAM was necessary to protect the integrity of climate mitigation efforts in Europe and ensure they were not undermined by carbon leakage. Moreover, the

35    The EUDR requires operators and traders to ensure that the products placed in the EU market are (i) deforestationfree (i.e., must not be derived from a land which is deforested after December 31 2020); (ii) should be produced following the relevant legislation of the country where the product is produced; and (iii) covers the submission of a due diligence statement before placing the products in the EU.

proposed ban on steel scrap exports from the EU, a key input for steel production, will significantly hinder developing countries' capacity to produce more carbon-efficient steel. This measure can be perceived as the EU attempting to enjoy the benefits of both sides while also imposing trade restrictions.

## Likely impact on India

The share of CBAM exports in total Indian exports to the EU has increased substantially from 6.3 per cent in 2014 to 10.5 per cent in 2023. 38  Table III.1 presents the commodity-wise exposure of India's exports to the EU, which are likely to be impacted by CBAM.

According  to  the  World  Bank's  Relative  CBAM  Exposure  Index 39 ,  India  has  a  score  of 0.03, reflecting a high exposure to CBAM. 40  Countries like India face the twin challenge of  achieving  higher  levels  of  economic  development  and  dealing  with  climate  change mitigation and adaptation. Therefore, the international community must find a balance that supports both environmental sustainability and the economic development needs of developing economies and LDCs, ensuring that multilateralism remains the cornerstone of global trade relations. 41

## European Union Deforestation Regulation

The EUDR (whose implementation will start at the end of 2025 and in 2026 for smaller businesses) seeks to regulate the consumption of products derived from deforested land. The EUDR places several compliances on the operators and traders of the relevant products

39    CBAM exposure index is measured as the mathematical product of two main elements-the share of a country's exports of the CBAM-related product that goes to the EU and the embodied carbon payment per dollar of export to  the  EU,  determined  by  the  carbon  emissions  intensity  of  production  and  the  assumed  cost  of  the  CBAM certificates.CBAM exposure index is measured by multiplying the export share by the embodied carbon payment per dollar of export to the EU (the exporter's emission intensity times $100 per ton carbon price).

covered  under  the  regulation. 42 It  requires  the  operators  and  traders  to  ensure  that  the products placed in the EU market are (i) deforestation-free (i.e., must not be derived from a land which is deforested after December 31 2020); (ii) should be produced by the relevant legislation of the country where the product is produced; and (iii) covers the submission of a due diligence statement, including supply chain integrity through an elaborate trace and track system before placing the products in the EU.

The regulation also entails  devising  a  country-level  benchmarking  system  indicating  the forest degradation and deforestation risk by the EU. The benchmarking system would be based on a three-tier system for classifying countries as low, standard, or high risk, which would be determined based on internationally recognised information and data on whether a  country  is  active  in  reducing  deforestation.  High-risk  countries  would  be  required  to exercise higher due diligence for the relevant products compared to low or standard-risk countries.  This categorisation of countries would be used to identify the checks to be carried out by the EU authorities. High-risk countries would be subject to more rigorous checks than countries categorised as having low-risk. 43

The regulation covers products such as soy, beef, palm oil, wood, cocoa, coffee, rubber, and their derived products, such as leather, chocolate, tyres, or furniture. 44 It puts the onus of proving compliance on the operator or trader who wishes to sell these products in the EU markets. 45 The costs of complying with the regulation include information requirements, risk assessment, risk mitigation and reporting obligations. These costs are not border measures but affect the competitiveness of a country's exports vis-Ã -vis other countries' compliance costs. Therefore, the Regulation would change the trade costs (increase) for the EU's trading partners in specific commodities.

As per a GTRI study 46 , as far as India's exports are concerned, coffee, leather hide and skin preparations, oil  cake,  paper,  paperboard,  and  wood  furniture  could  be  highly  impacted by the Regulation. It also compares the tariff lines covered under the Regulation vis-Ã -vis

42    The  Regulation defines an 'operator' as natural or legal person who, in the course of a commercial activity, places relevant products on the market or exports them and a 'trader' as any person in the supply chain other than the operator who, in the course of a commercial activity, makes relevant products available on the market.

43    As  per  the  Regulation  dated  31  May  2023,  'In  respect  of  relevant  products  from  countries  or  parts  thereof classified  as  high  risk,  the  respective  operators  and  traders  and  the  volumes  of  their  share  of  relevant commodities and relevant products, a twofold approach that provides comprehensive coverage should apply. Competent authorities should thus be required to check on a certain percentage of operators and traders, whilst also covering a specific percentage of relevant products. In respect of relevant products from countries or parts thereof classified as low or standard risk, competent authorities should be required to check at least a certain percentage of operators and traders. The level of checks should be higher for relevant products from high-risk countries or parts thereof whereas it could be lower for standard or low-risk countries or parts thereof.'

44    The list of products covered under the Regulation is available at Annex I of the Regulation dated 31 May 2023, available at https://tinyurl.com/bddmuysp.

45    Article 2 (15) of the Regulation states, 'An operator is a natural or legal person who places relevant products on the Union market or exports them from the Union market in the course of commercial activity.'

46    GTRI brief dated 1 August 2023, 'Deforestation and Compliance Challenges: A Blow to India's Agri Exports as EU's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) Deadline Looms', https://gtri.co.in/gtriFlagshipRep12.pdf.

CBAM, out of which the latter is wider in its coverage. The CBAM and EUDR are expected to affect USD 9.5 billion of India's exports to the EU, which amounts to 9 per cent of India's exports to the world or 12.9 per cent of India's exports to the EU. The study informs that the regulation effectively encourages local production and export of selected agricultural commodities by erecting more barriers against imports in the name of climate.

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, around 420 million hectares of forest were lost globally due to deforestation between 1990 and 2020, an area the  size  of  the  EU. 47 In  Europe,  conversion  to  cropland  accounted  for  about  15  per  cent of deforestation during the same time period. 48  European agriculture could not have come up without deforestation, and the imposition of EUDR reeks of double standards. Thus, that  a  region  that  has  resorted  to  significant  deforestation  to  expand  crop  production  is implementing the EUDR to regulate the consumption of products sourced from deforested land, appears quite contradictory, even as it is unsurprising.

In short, it is hard to shake off the conclusion that both CBAM and EUDR are trade protection measures garbed in the language of climate and environment. The game and the end goals are the same, but the tactics keep changing. Labour standards, gender, democracy, emissions and deforestation, the innovative list will keep evolving with time. Institutions and practices evolve  with  development.  Today's  developed  countries  do  not  conform  to  the  standards that  they  expect  from  developing  countries  at  a  similar  stage  of  development.  But  then, intellectual consistency is not really the goal here.

3.18  NTMs are playing an increasing role in international trade due to a decline in the usage of tariffs worldwide via successive agreements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/WTO and due to growing consumer concerns about food safety, quality, and environmental protection. 49  A UNCTAD report 50  notes that NTMs can serve as legitimate policy instruments, fulfilling important roles such as protecting human health and the environment. In some cases, they may even enhance trade. For instance, when an exporting  country  implements  high  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  standards, consumers in importing countries tend to have greater confidence in the quality of the food products, which can lead to increased demand. Stricter domestic food safety standards can also help local exporters meet the requirements of their trade partners, further boosting trade opportunities.

3.19 Though many NTMs aim primarily to protect public health or the environment, they also adversely impact trade by increasing information, compliance, and procedural costs. This is significant for exporters and importers because accessing and benefiting from markets increasingly depends on adherence to trade regulations, such as sanitary

standards  and  product  quality  requirements.  For  instance,  a  regulation  that  limits pesticide residues in food products seeks to achieve a significant public health goal of protecting human health and nutrition. However, this regulation imposes additional compliance  requirements  on  firms  in  exporting  countries,  and  some  may  find  that exporting  is  no  longer  profitable.  Consequently,  such  regulations  can  restrict  trade, leading to lower incomes in exporting countries and higher prices for consumers in importing  countries.  This  issue  mainly  affects  smaller  exporters  and  low-income countries, as they often bear a disproportionate burden from these NTMs. 51

3.20  NTMs can indirectly affect FDI through their impact on imports. A firm might decide to bypass an NTM by engaging in FDI if the costs associated with this approach are lower than the costs of exporting. Additionally, NTMs can encourage inward FDI to the country that imposes them, as these measures raise barriers to market access. Research has demonstrated that NTMs have a positive impact on FDI. For example, if the average number of NTMs applied to a product increases from 2.5 to 3.5 NTMs per product, FDI could increase by 12 per cent. Certain NTMs, such as intellectual property rights, local content requirements, and TBT in specific sectors, appear to affect FDI significantly. 52

## TREND IN INDIA'S TRADE PERFORMANCE

3.21  India's trade sector has demonstrated remarkable stability and growth, achieving milestones despite global economic headwinds. Following a dip in FY20 amid the global downturn and the pandemic, overall exports rebounded strongly in FY22, reaching a  record  high  in  FY23.  This  momentum  continued  into  FY24,  with  overall  exports surpassing the previous year's record, even as imports moderated slightly.

3.22  India's total exports (merchandise+services) have shown positive momentum in the first nine months of FY25, reaching USD 602.6 billion, witnessing a YoY growth of 6 per cent. This increase demonstrates the resilience of exports, which have been building on a steady upward trend in recent years despite global economic challenges. Total imports during April-December 2024 reached USD 682.2 billion, registering a YoY growth of 6.9 per cent. This positive import growth indicates a steady demand for goods in the Indian market, supporting domestic consumption and production needs. A more significant increase in overall imports compared to exports led to a rise in the overall trade deficit from USD 69.7 billion during April-December 2023 to USD 79.5 billion in the corresponding period of FY25.

3.23  During April-December 2024, non-petroleum exports were  up by 7.1 per cent. Over the same period, non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery exports rose by 9.1 per cent. Specific sectors like drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronic goods, engineering

goods, and chemicals saw an increase in exports, growing by 6.4 per cent, 28.6 per cent, 9.9 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively, during April-December 2024 on a YoY basis. Textile exports 53  also saw a YoY increase of 7.6 per cent during the same period. Rising inflationary pressures on cereals, pulses, and edible oils limited the exports of agricultural  and  allied  products.  Overall,  merchandise  exports  registered  a  modest growth  of  1.6  per  cent  (YoY  basis)  primarily  attributed  to  a  decline  in  the  value  of petroleum product exports due to a fall in international commodity prices.

3.24 Merchandise  imports  grew  by  5.2  per  cent  during  April-December  2024.  This increase was largely due to a rise in non-oil, non-gold imports, which reached USD 352.1 billion in the first nine months of FY25 compared to USD 340.5 billion during the same period last year, indicating a rebound in domestic consumption despite the inflationary impact. Gold imports increased due to higher international prices, driven by frontloading ahead of festival spending and demand for safe-haven assets. Among the major non-oil, non-gold imports, non-ferrous metals, machine tools, machinery, electrical  &amp;  non-electrical  goods,  and  transport  equipment  witnessed  remarkable growth  in  the  first  nine  months  of  FY25,  reflecting  growing  demand  for  capital goods.  Electronic  goods  also  maintained  consistent  momentum,  signalling  a  rise  in discretionary consumer spending. Additionally, imports of pulses and cotton rose to support domestic production and control inflation.

3.25   The  faster  pace  of  increase  in  merchandise  imports  compared  to  exports contributed to the widening of the merchandise trade deficit to USD 210.8 billion in April-December 2024, compared to USD 189.7 billion in the same period last year.

53    Textile exports include Cotton Yarn/Fabrics/made-ups, Handloom Products, Man-made Yarn/Fabrics/madeups, etc., RMG of all Textiles, Jute Mfg. including Floor covering, carpet and Handicrafts, excluding handmade carpet.

## Textile exports

3.26 India's textile sector has been a matter of pride and strength to the nation for centuries. From the unique prints and weaves to the rich dyes and handwork, the textile sector weaves various aspects of our cultural, social, and historical heritage. India is the sixth-largest exporter of textiles and apparel globally. The textile and apparel industry contributes 2.3 per cent of GDP, 13 per cent to industrial production, and 12 per cent to exports. 54 It is also one of the largest employment generators after agriculture, with over 45 million people employed directly, including many women and the rural population. 55 As further evidence of the inclusive nature of this industry, nearly 80 per cent of its capacity is spread across Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) clusters in the country. 56

3.27    India  exported  textile  items  worth  USD  34  billion  in  2023,  with  apparel constituting  42  per  cent  of  the  export  basket  (USD  14.6  billion),  followed  by  raw materials/semi-finished materials at 34 per cent (USD 11.7 billion) and finished nonapparel goods at 30 per cent (USD 7.8 billion). 57  Europe and the US consumed nearly 66 per cent of India's apparel exports, 58 per cent of finished non-apparel goods and 12  per  cent  of  raw  materials/semi-finished  materials.  Other  prominent  destinations include the UK (8 per cent of apparel exports) and the UAE (7 per cent).

3.28  Generally, the Indian textile export basket is skewed towards cotton and cottonbased products. In 2023, for example, eight out of the top 10 textile exports (by value) consisted of cotton and cotton-based products. For India's major textile export category,

57  Analysis based on UN COMTRADE data at the tariff level.

i.e.,  apparel,  the  country  enjoyed  a  market  share  of  2.8  per  cent  globally  in  2023. However, this is much lower than that of key players in the industry, such as China (30 per cent), Bangladesh (9 per cent), and Vietnam (7 per cent). Further analysis at the HS-6 levels reveals that while India offers stiff competition to other exporters 58 for nearly USD 3 billion worth of apparel exports, the remaining apparel basket is yet to match our competitors' comparative advantage.

3.29 Textile  exports  remained  resilient  throughout  the  COVID-19  period  between 2020 to 2022, but their performance has been weak over a decadal timeframe. Box III.3 elaborates on potential factors that impede export growth and opportunities that must be tapped for the sector to reach its goal of USD 150 billion in textile exports by 2030. 59

## Box III.3: Time to be deft about our warp and weft!

## Costs that chip away at textile export growth

India's  textile  production  occurs  across  multiple  independent  and  clustered  Small  and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) spread across the country. Take cotton production, for example, which is spread across Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. The fresh produce of cotton then travels down to Tamil Nadu, where cotton yarns are produced. The yarns then travel to parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat before being weaved into cotton fabric. A lack of localisation and the complexity of the value chain, in turn, results in higher costs relative to global competitors. In contrast, vertically integrated 'fibre-to-fashion' firms in competitor nations such as China and Vietnam export low-cost products, maintain consistent quality and are nimble enough to adjust to the fast-changing nature of the industry. Simple and liberal customs procedures further reduce regulatory costs and lend a competitive edge to the exports of global textile competitors such as China and Vietnam.

On the other hand, in India textile exporters are constrained by complex procedures, which, for instance, require exporters to meticulously account for every square centimetre of fabric, buttons and zippers used. Similarly, pre-shipment inspection certificates are required for textile imports, which slows down logistics and raises costs for the textile business. 60

58    Exports at the HS-6 level enjoy a market share that is within the periphery or higher than the market share of China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.

59  PIB press release of Ministry of Textiles dated 18 November 2024, https://tinyurl.com/jhvcuttm

60    GTRI report, July 2024, 'How complex procedures, import restrictions and domestic interests hinder India's garment exports',  https://tinyurl.com/yxjxjzyz.

Apart from possessing structural attributes (such as vertical integration, liberal labour laws, etc.) that allow for cost advantages, competitors in the textile market also have the added benefit of FTAs with consumer countries. In effect, Indian apparel exports do not face a level playing field compared to its competition. For instance, as noted by Mukherjee et al. 2019 61 , even though India has a significant comparative advantage in exporting silk shawls and scarves, the country faces a high tariff rate of 11.3 per cent in the US. In comparison, competitors like Korea face zero tariffs on their silk scarf exports due to trade agreements such as the US-Korea FTA.

In  general,  the  costs  for  the  textile  industry  are  likely  to  rise  over  the  coming  years.  A global  structural  shift  towards  sustainable  sourcing  would  drive  this.  Often,  such  a  shift is  necessitated by regulatory changes. The EU, for instance, has as many as 16 pieces of legislation spanning the entire fashion value chain, which came into force between 2021 and 2024. 62  As the EU accounts for nearly 20 per cent of our exports, such a shift poses a challenge for small enterprises who need to shift to environmentally sustainable production methods.

## Changing trends in the global textile industry

India has a great opportunity to align with the evolving global shifts in apparel demand. While our comparative advantage lies in cotton and cotton-based products, global demand has shifted to products made from man-made fibre (MMF). MMF-based products range from  yoga  pants  and  athleisure  wear  to  technical  textiles  in  aviation,  aerospace,  and automobiles.

As  per  International  Cotton  Association,  MMF  comprised  77  per  cent  of  global  fibre consumption in 2024, whereas it was just 22 per cent for cotton.

By tapping into the MMF value chain, India will benefit from the steady rise in global MMF demand. India's share of global MMF production is currently 9.2 per cent, and the potential to catch up with the production levels of global leaders like Vietnam, China, and Taiwan is high. 63

To match the quality of our competition and reap value gains from MMF production, our MMF sector must move towards vertical integration and significantly invest in research and development and sustainable production techniques.

## Fashioning  India's  textile  exports  to  a  global  audience-recent  schemes  and opportunities ahead

In recent years, the government has announced many policies in response to the changing nature of global demand and high relative costs faced by Indian exporters. A PLI scheme has been put in place for the sector with an outlay of â¹10,683 crore, which rewards capacity

creation through investments in the industry. As MMF products require heavy research and development suited to different use cases, the National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM) has been approved with an outlay of â¹1,480 crore. As of 2024, 168 research projects (worth â¹509 crore) were approved under the NTTM mission. 64

In response to the need for a vertically integrated textile industry, the government-sanctioned Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM-MITRA) parks across seven sites in 2022 to create world-class plug-and-play infrastructure and invite FDI into the  textile  sector.  World-class,  standardised  infrastructure  will  also  aid  textile  exporters in  responding  better  to  changing  ESG  requirements  in  the  industry.  To  help  with  cost competitiveness, the Government approved the continuation of the Scheme for Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) for export of Apparel/Garments and Madeups up to 31 March 2026 in the interim Union Budget FY25 65 . Further, deep FTAs such as the UAE-India CEPA (2022) have helped reduce India's textile tariffs with a significant market. India is actively working towards negotiating trade deals with top importers such as the EU and the UK.

India's  textile  sector  has  several  tailwinds  working  in  its  favour.  For  instance,  as  per McKinsey's  chief  procurement  officer  survey,  the  share  of  procurement  officers  looking to form long-term strategic partnerships (including volume commitments) has more than doubled between 2019 and 2023. 66  Further, more than 40 per cent of procurement officers surveyed plan to increase their sourcing from India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

64  PIB press release of Ministry of Textiles dated 12 November 2024, https://tinyurl.com/4kf8sdnz.

65  PIB press release dated 1 February 2024, https://tinyurl.com/35faj878.

66  McKinsey article, 'Reimagining the apparel value chain amid volatility', https://tinyurl.com/2nhedse4.

While there are tailwinds which will support the growth of India's textile exports, these cannot be fully exploited without lowering the costs of the textile basket and deepening our market share in the MMF sector. These objectives would require the industry to step up its research efforts and vertically integrate and tailor products to international quality and sustainability requirements.

Simplification, consolidation, and elimination of processes that consume the financial and managerial bandwidth of our exporters is a low-hanging fruit. Addressing these challenges can significantly reduce costs and ease the burden on exporters, helping them become more efficient and competitive.

## Diversification of India's exports to new markets

3.30  As discussed in a Collection of Essays of the Department of Economic Affairs 67 , over time, India has added a large number of new products to its export basket. Between 1994 and 2022, India has not just carved out new markets but has become the market leader  in  some  of  the  new  product  categories.  For  instance,  India  is  a  top  exporter of  shipping vessels (with nearly 33 per cent market share). Similarly, it is a leading exporter of iron and steel alloys, an unexplored market before 1994.

3.31  Between April and November 2024, India's exports saw significant growth and expansion into diverse markets despite high global challenges. The analysis depicts the number of diverse markets, consisting of absolutely new markets where no exports were  observed  between  April  and  November  2023,  but  exports  happened  in  the corresponding period of FY25. It also includes new markets where export share was 0-0.1 per cent from April to November 2023 and rose to over 0.1 per cent with growth in value greater than 25 per cent in the corresponding period of FY25. Further, promising markets, where export share was 0.1-1 per cent in April to November 2023 and rose to over 1 per cent with growth in value greater than 25 per cent in April to November 2024. The size of the dot reflects the value of exports. The analysis has been done based on the data available for key Principal Commodities (PCs).

3.32  These 20 PCs were selected based on two criteria: firstly, the PCs were sorted in descending order of the number of new markets explored, and secondly, the PCs had an export value of more than USD 100 million. For instance, Chat III.15 shows that optical items had an export value of USD 16.6 million from April to November 2024 and were exported to 14 new markets (Zimbabwe, Vietnam, Tanzania, Uganda, Tunisia, Romania, Qatar, Philippines, Mozambique, Kuwait, South Korea, Iraq, Ghana, Finland). Similarly, the export of cranes, lifts and winches had a value of USD 23.1 million from April to November 2024, which has been exported to 12 new markets (Taiwan, Somalia, Portugal, Myanmar, Morocco, Madagascar, Lithuania, Jordan, Honduras, Cameroon, Armenia).  Further, office equipment &amp; medical-scientific instruments have an export value of USD 10.7 million (exported to 12 new markets) and USD 62.7 million (exported

to 9 new markets), respectively. Surgicals has also been exported to nine new markets with a total value of USD 5.4 million.

<!-- image -->

3.33 These trends reflect India's ability to maintain and even strengthen its presence in established markets. It also highlights the country's resilience and adaptability in navigating evolving global landscapes. Simultaneously, the exploration of new markets signifies a proactive approach to expanding its export reach and reducing dependency on any single market or region. This diversification strategy mitigates risks associated with market fluctuations and positions India as a more competitive player in the international trade landscape while contributing to the country's economic development.

## Services trade remained resilient amidst global challenges

3.34 Services sector exports have demonstrated resilience, while merchandise exports have witnessed moderation in recent months. They grew at 11.6 per cent in the first nine months of FY25 amidst unfavourable geopolitical conditions. The rise in services exports contributed to an increase in net services receipts from USD 120.1 billion in the first nine months of FY24 to USD 131.3 billion during the corresponding period of FY25.

<!-- image -->

3.35   Services  exports  from  India  have  shown  a  multi-sectoral  presence  in  global exports,  with  notable  contributions  across  several  sectors.  India's  share  in  global services exports has more than doubled, reaching around 4.3 per cent in 2023 from 1.9 per cent in 2005. 68    In 'Telecommunications, Computer, &amp; Information Services', India commands 10.2 per cent of the global exports market (ranking 2nd largest exporter in the world), reflecting its strong position in IT outsourcing, software development, and digital services. The 'Other Business Services sector' also plays a crucial role, with India holding 7.2 per cent of the world share (ranking 3rd largest exporter in the world), driven by its expertise in professional and consulting services. 69

3.36  'Travel' and 'Transport' services represent areas where India holds a relatively smaller share in global exports, at 2.1 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively, likely facing competition from other worldwide tourism and logistics hubs. There are opportunities for  further  growth,  especially  in  enhancing  international tourism infrastructure and global  transport  networks.  India's  financial  services  sector  lags  behind  the  global average,  highlighting  the  potential  for  growth  in  global  banking,  insurance,  and investment services. On the other hand, with a global share of 3.4 per cent in 'Personal, Cultural,  &amp;  Recreational'  services  and  3.5  per  cent  in  'Construction  services,'  India ranks 6th and 8th, respectively, demonstrating its competitive edge in cultural exports and international infrastructure projects.

3.37  India remains a global leader in IT and business services, but there is considerable untapped potential in travel, transport, and financial services. As the country becomes a  hub  for  Global  Capability  Centres  and  continues  to  innovate,  focusing  on  skill development and strategic policy interventions will be key to sustaining this momentum. Strengthening  emerging  sectors  and  improving  global  competitiveness  will  ensure

## India's e-commerce exports

3.38 The  e-commerce  industry  in  India  has  experienced  swift  expansion  over  the past  few  years,  driven  by  various  elements  such  as  the  rise  of  technology-powered advancements like online payments, localised delivery services, data-driven interactions with customers, and digital marketing. According to a report, the global B2C e-commerce market is expected to grow from USD 5.7 trillion in 2022 to USD 8.1 trillion by 2026 at a CAGR of 9.1 per cent. Correspondingly, India's B2C e-commerce market was worth USD 83 billion in 2022, and it is anticipated to grow to USD 150 billion by 2026, showing a CAGR of 15.9 per cent. 70  However, by current market size, India's e-commerce market makes up a small fraction, about 1.5 per cent of the global market, and it is projected to stay around 2 per cent in the coming years. These exports generated an estimated USD 4 to 5 billion in exports during FY23 and are expected to increase to USD 200 to USD 300 billion by 2030. 71  Box III.4 discusses the factors and policies that have played a key role in enhancing India's e-commerce exports.

## Box III. 4:  Factors driving India's e-commerce exports

Expanding data connectivity, increased penetration of smartphones, a rise in availability and use of digital wallets and safer online payments, increased customers' income levels and  growing  familiarity  with  digital  shopping  platforms  have  provided  an  impetus  to India's  e-commerce  exports.  Customers  increasingly  prefer  customised  products  from skilled artisans, and India can leverage its rich tradition of handcrafted items to meet this demand. Additionally, exporters can increase their profits by reducing costs associated with intermediaries  like  agents  and  shopkeepers,  making  e-commerce  a  lucrative  option  for selling products. 72

Government initiatives, such as Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat , have enhanced support and focus on MSMEs and e-commerce exports, thereby paving the way for more domestic sellers going global. These initiatives have provided a conducive environment for businesses to thrive and expand their reach. Recognising the relevance of e-commerce exports, the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023 has laid down provisions for fostering cross-border digital trade and promoting e-commerce and other emerging export channels. These include the Niryat Bandhu scheme 73 , financial assistance to e-commerce exporters under the Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme, export and packing credit 74 , e-commerce exporthubs 75 ,

In  the  recent  past,  various  initiatives  have  been  undertaken  by  state  governments  in collaboration  with  e-commerce  market  players  to  boost  exports.  These  have  included organising e-export Haat 80  and signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with leading e-commerce players to drive e-commerce exports, etc. 81  The Uttar Pradesh government has recently implemented measures to enhance packaging and export capabilities by leveraging design, technology, and market access. The government is also planning to set up e-commerce hubs to facilitate small producers to sell to aggregators. 82  The governmen t of Telangana has announced a new MSME policy which, inter-alia, envisages an increase in e-commerce penetration in MSMEs by encouraging the participation of sellers on the ONDC portal and GeM portal. 83

The central government's E-Commerce Export Hub (ECEH) initiative aims to revolutionise India's cross-border e-commerce. These hubs connect SMEs, artisans, and One District One Product (ODOP) producers to global markets, boosting logistics efficiency and economic inclusion in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. On the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), revised pricing slabs now cap charges at â¹3 lakh for orders above â¹10 crore, significantly reducing transaction costs. The Bharat Mart in Dubai provides Indian MSMEs affordable access to the Gulf Cooperation Council, African, and CIS markets, enhancing exports to these regions. 84

The e-commerce export ecosystem in India presents opportunities for growth alongside a few challenges related to regulatory frameworks and compliance obligations. For example, the  roles  of  sellers  and  e-commerce  platform  operators  are  not  yet  clearly  defined.  This requires collaboration between sellers and e-commerce operators at various stages of export and  payment  processes.  Presently,  exports  are  facilitated  through  two  primary  modes, courier and cargo, with a courier export value limit of USD 12,0 00 (â¹1 0 lakh), which is less compared to other countries. 85

78    As per section 2(47) of the CGST Act, 2017, a supply is said to be exempt, when it attracts nil rate of duty or is specifically exempted by a notification or kept out of the purview of tax (i.e., a non-GST supply).

79    This enables the exporter to claim a refund of tax paid on such supplies and a refund of unutilised input tax credit under the Letter of Undertaking.

85    In the case of China, the consignment limit for e-commerce exports is USD 50,000, https://content.dgft.gov.in/ Website/EcommExportHandbokMSME\_E.pdf.

Additionally,  the  absence  of  distinct  customs  supervision  codes  for  traditional  and e-commerce exports leads to delays in customs verification, and hinders data collection for further policy interventions. 86

The RBI manages the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 1999, which requires foreign exchange receipts within nine months of shipment. This timeline supports efficient transactions  but  may  pose  challenges  for  e-commerce  operators  handling  shipments sold  over  12  to  18  months.  It  opens  the  door  to  exploring  more  flexible  reconciliation timelines. The Export Data Processing and Monitoring System (EDPMS) aids in payment reconciliation, with costs ranging from USD 18 to USD 36 (â¹1,500-â¹3,000). There is a need for  cost  optimisation,  particularly  for  small-value  shipments.  Additionally,  reimporting of  e-commerce  refunds/rejects  is  exempted  from  duty  only  when  it  can  be  proven  that the  reimported  goods,  are  the  same  as  those  exported,  which  is  a  cumbersome  process. Simplifying these further could improve operational efficiency. 87

India's e-commerce exports hold immense potential to grow significantly and become a key contributor to the country's GDP. Addressing some of the existing challenges can further unlock opportunities for the sector to achieve its full potential and strengthen its position among leading global e-commerce exporters.

## EASE OF DOING BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR EXPORTERS

3.39    An important area of focus is enhancing logistics efficiency to strengthen India's manufacturing and export capabilities. The development of logistics hubs, investments in infrastructure, and policy reforms to improve supply chain efficiency are measures in this direction. Such efforts aim to lower costs for Indian businesses, making exports more competitive and enabling quicker, smoother movement of goods domestically and internationally. This approach aligns with the government's commitment to the National Logistics Policy.

3.40 The paperless e-BRC system has reduced costs for 2.5 million e-BRCs annually by over â¹125 crore, streamlined processes and helped exporters benefit from schemes under the FTP. It has cut down both administrative and environmental expenses. Small exporters, especially in e-commerce, have benefitted from the system's efficiency in handling  high-volume,  low-cost  transactions,  enabling  them  to  claim  benefits  and refunds more effectively.

3.41    A new Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) 'Trade Connect e-Platform' has been launched which is a single window initiative enabling exporters to add newer markets.  The  e-platform  aims  to  transform  the  international  trade  landscape  for Indian  exporters,  especially  MSMEs.  The  platform,  developed  in  collaboration  with key partners, including the Ministry of MSME, EXIM Bank, Department of Financial Services, and the Ministry of External Affairs, is set to address information asymmetry by offering exporters comprehensive support and resources. It is a one-stop solution,

86  Ibid note 70.

87  Ibid note 70.

providing exporters with near real-time access to critical trade-related information while seamlessly connecting them to key government entities such as the Indian Missions abroad,  the  DoC,  Export  Promotion  Councils,  and  other  trade  experts.  Whether  a seasoned exporter or a new entrant, the platform is designed to assist businesses at every stage of their export journey. This e-platform shall connect more than 6 lakh IEC (Importer Exporter Code) holders, over 180 Indian Mission officials, and over 600 Export Promotion Council Officials, besides the officials from DGFT, DoC, banks, etc. 3.42    The  DGFT  Trade  Facilitation  Mobile  App  provides  all  information  on  FTP Updates, Import/Export Policy, Export/Import Statistics, the status of applications, and 24Ã7 virtual assistance. The department also provides 24Ã7 auto-generation of e-IEC. This enables users to not wait for any approval for an IEC. The IEC details are automatically validated against CBDT, MCA, and PFMS systems.

## BALANCE OF PAYMENTS: RESILIENCE AMID CHALLENGES

3.43   Against  the  backdrop  of  uncertainties  in  the  external  trade  and  investment environment, India's Balance of Payments (BoP) position has remained stable, led by resilient services exports, benign crude oil prices, renewed foreign portfolio inflows, and a revival in FDI flows. These trends are discussed in this Section.

## Current account

3.44  India's current account deficit (CAD) moderated slightly to 1.2 per cent of GDP in Q2 of FY25 against 1.3 per cent of the GDP recorded in Q2 of FY24. The recent rise in the CAD can be attributed to an increase in the merchandise trade deficit, which rose to USD 75.3 billion in Q2 of FY25 from USD 64.5 billion in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. The rising net services receipts and increase in private transfer receipts cushioned the expansion in the merchandise trade deficit. Net service receipts increased to USD 44.5 billion in Q2 of FY25 from USD 39.9 billion in the corresponding quarter in FY24.

3.45 India's CAD has remained relatively contained compared to other G20 economies, such as Brazil and Australia, which have faced similar external pressures, including higher commodity prices and weaker global demand.

3.46 Private transfers, mainly driven by remittances by Indians employed overseas, formed the bulk of net transfers, growing steadily from USD 28.1 billion in Q2 of FY24 to USD 31.9 billion in Q2 of FY25. This growth reflects the continued strength of India's diaspora and robust remittance inflows despite global economic uncertainties.

## Capital and Financial Account

3.47   The Capital and Financial Account is a vital segment of the BoP, serving as the primary mechanism for financing the CAD and strengthening foreign exchange reserves. Over the period from Q1 of FY23 to Q2 of FY25, India has generally recorded surpluses in  the  capital  account, largely driven by robust inflows from FDI, FPI, and external loans. These inflows have supported the country's external position and contributed to building foreign exchange reserves.

3.48   The  growth  trajectory  of  capital  inflows  has  shown  signs  of  revival  in  recent quarters. In Q2 of FY25, net capital inflows stood at USD 30.5 billion, a significant increase from the USD 12.8 billion recorded during the same period in the previous year. This rise can be primarily attributed to increased FPI inflows, external commercial borrowings, and NRI deposits.

## Performance of FDI flows

3.49  FDI recorded a revival in FY25, with gross FDI inflows 88  increasing from USD 47.2 billion in the first eight months of FY24 to USD 55.6 billion in the same period of FY25, a YoY growth of 17.9 per cent.

3.50 Over the long term, FDI inflows into India have surpassed the USD 1 trillion mark from April 2000 to September 2024, solidifying the country's position as a safe and significant global investment destination. According to data from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) 89 , the cumulative FDI inflows, which  include  equity  inflows,  reinvested  earnings,  and  other  capital,  reached  USD 1,033.4 billion during this period.

3.51 From a sectoral perspective, the services sector 90 remains the largest recipient of FDI, accounting for 19.1 per cent of total equity inflows in H1 of FY25. Other significant sectors attracting foreign investments include computer software and hardware (14.1 per cent), trading (9.1 per cent), non-conventional energy (7 per cent), and cement &amp; gypsum products (6.1 per cent). 91  Despite the short-term volatility in global markets, triggered by factors such as inflationary pressures, rising interest rates in developed economies, and geopolitical tensions, the long-term outlook for FDI in India remains favourable.  India's  robust  economic  fundamentals,  ongoing  structural  reforms,  and growing consumer market position make it a key destination for foreign investments.

3.52    FDI into India has recently been scrutinised due to concerns about declining inflows.  However,  a  broader  analysis 92 reveals  that  FDI  flows  globally  have  been hampered by economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and rising borrowing costs. Even though gross FDI inflows to India have increased in the first eight months of FY25, it has been accompanied by a rise in repatriations as international companies realised returns from investments. Many multinational companies have capitalised on India's strong stock market through secondary sales and Initial Public Offerings, indicating investor  confidence.  In  2024,  private  equity-backed  exits  increased,  supported  by India's  stable  macroeconomic  environment  and  investor-friendly  policies.  As  per Avendus  Spark  analysis  based  on  DPIIT  data,  Private  Equity  and  Venture  Capital exit from Indian stock markets stood at USD 19.5 billion from January to September 2024, higher than USD 18.3 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year. 93 The depth and resilience of the Indian capital market offer profitable exits for direct investors, boosting future investments. 94

3.53  India remains a strong destination for FDI, ranking high in greenfield project announcements and international project finance deals. However, the country has to pay heed to numbers. As per the data published by RBI, net FDI to India during the first eight months of FY25 stood at USD 0.48 billion compared to USD 8.5 billion in the corresponding period of FY24. 95  Similarly, for FY23, the figure stood at USD 19.8 billion. For FY24 as a whole, the net FDI was USD 10.1 billion. The last two financial years have indeed seen much larger repatriation from India. The amounts were USD 29.3 billion and USD 44.5 billion, respectively, in FY23 and FY24. In the current year, up to November, the repatriation amount is USD 39.6 billion. At this rate, the full-year figure might exceed last year's figure.

3.54  To a large extent, this is a success story as foreigners take profits. Second, much of it was sold to portfolio investors. In other words, the large portfolio inflows in FY24 were the other side of the coin of large repatriation. At a gross level, FY23 and FY24 have seen a decline in gross FDI, including earnings retained in India. This has broken the steadily rising trend seen since FY14. The period between FY13 and FY22 witnessed

95    Net FDI is calculated as follows: -

- (1) FDI by foreigners: Foreign direct investment inflows+retained earnings-repatriation
- (2) FDI by Indians: Indian investment overseas +retained earnings-repatriation

(3) The net FDI figure: (1)-(2)

- (4) Then, there are Portfolio Investment flows: -

- (6) Total Investment flows: (1)-(2) +(3)

ultra-low interest rates and quantitative easing policies in the developed world. The cost of funds was much lower. Interest rates in developed countries rose sharply in 2022 and 2023. The Federal Funds Rate topped 5 per cent. Other Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia also witnessed declines in inward FDI in 2023, according to UNCTAD.

3.55  However, India runs a CAD, and its investment needs are much larger considering the size of its economy. Supplementing domestic savings with reasonably large foreign savings expands the scope for capital formation. If, for various reasons, capital flows are going to be problematic, it raises questions as to the level of sustainable CAD for India. It may not be 2.5 per cent to 3 per cent as before, but it is much lower. It used to be said that a country can run as large a CAD as the Rest of the World (RoW) is willing to finance. If the RoW is unwilling or unable to do so for various reasons, then the size of the CAD will have to be lower. Developed countries, too, are wooing investments, and India is not competing with other emerging economies alone. So, India has two options.

3.56  One, we must pull out all the stops wooing FDI and making itself more attractive for  foreign  investors.  India  has  been  doing  so.  For  example,  most  sectors  in  the country are open for foreign investors under the automatic route. The large amount of repatriations, as witnessed in the data, also suggests that it is easy to transfer the returns on investment made in India. However, there is room to improve tax certainty and  tax  stability  in  matters  such  as  APA  (Advance  Pricing  Agreement).  India  has simplified many of its laws, rules and regulations over the years leading to a regime shift in terms of the ease of doing business compared to yester years. At the same time, all statutory and regulatory authorities must bear in mind that international investors benchmark countries cross-sectionally and not longitudinally. That will determine the success of the government's goal to make global companies produce in India for the world, making India a part of the global supply chain.

3.57    The  second  option  is  to  make  the  available  and  existing  investments  deliver more. In other words, if the investment rate cannot be increased because of capital constraints, then investment efficiency has to go up. That is where deregulation and 'Ease of Doing Business' come into play. That is why the main theme of this Survey is about deregulation.  Therein  lies  the  clue  to  improving  India's  investment  efficiency.  Most of the chapters peer into regulations and recommend deregulation. The deregulation theme is explored in greater detail in Chapter 5.

## Performance of Portfolio flows

3.58  FPIs became net buyers in the Indian equity market starting in June 2024 after being sellers in the first two months of FY25. This trend continued until September 2024, showcasing a clear preference for Indian equities as FPIs injected substantial capital into the market over those months. However, this trend reversed in October and the first  half  of  November  2024,  resulting  in  a  net  outflow  of  USD  11.5  billion and 2.5 billion, respectively. Factors such as concerns about slowing earnings growth, high valuations, rising geopolitical tensions, and recent developments in China 96  led FPIs to withdraw significant funds from Indian equities. However, during the latter half of November 2024, FPIs became more optimistic about the Indian stock market, reversing  the  significant  selling  seen  in  October  and  early  November  2024.  This positive trend in FPI inflows continued in December 2024, with net inflows amounting to USD 3.1 billion in December 2024. Factors such as India's strong macroeconomic fundamentals,  favourable  business  environment  and  robust  economic  growth  have encouraged investors to reverse the outflow trend. On a cumulative basis, the net FPI inflows 97  into India slowed to USD 10.6 billion from April to December 2024 from USD 31.7 billion during the same period the previous year. The volatility in portfolio flows underscores  the  susceptibility  of  equity  and  bond  markets  to  global  developments. However, the sound economic and corporate fundamentals in India underpin the longterm attractiveness of the Indian equity market for foreign investors.

<!-- image -->

3.59  The inclusion of Indian Government Bonds (IGB) in some global bond indices this year has significantly supported debt inflows. Since the announcement of inclusion in JP Morgan index in October 2023, there has been heightened activity in the FPI debt segment with cumulative flows of â¹ 1.1 lakh crore from October 2023 to June 2024. Post effective date of inclusion, FPIs invested â¹ 62,431 crore in the debt segment from July to November 2024. Assets under custody, which reflects the total market value of the holdings, shows that FPI's cumulative investment in Fully Accessible Route (FAR) securities crossed the USD 20 billion mark within nine months of the announcement of their inclusion in the JP Morgan EM Bond Index. In FY25, as of 15 December 2024, inclusion already resulted in a net inflow of more than USD 3 billion in Indian FAR bonds, with assets under custody of India FAR bonds standing at USD 28 billion as of 15 December 2024. 98

3.60  Since the investor sentiment/perception of the trajectory of Fed rates and the interest rate differentials are the key drivers of FPI flows in India, it will be interesting to analyse the trends in FPI debt flows and the yield differential between India and the US. Chart III.17 compares the FPI debt flows and the yield gap between India and US10 year yields, which shows that a widening yield differential in India's favour leads to higher inflows (November 2023 to March 2024) and vice-versa. India's strong growth fundamentals  and  range-bound  inflation  also  made  it  a  preferred  choice  amongst foreign investors despite the narrowing yield differentials seen from May to July 2024.

<!-- image -->

3.61   The increase in demand for India's G-Secs is also set to have a positive externality in terms of lowering the borrowing costs for the government as the yields soften due to heightened demand and limited supply dynamics. The preliminary impact of this is  already  visible  in  the  Indian  10Y  G-Sec  yields.  The  inclusion  of  Indian  bonds  in global indices signals a growing appetite amongst foreign investors to include Indian government securities in their investment portfolios, trust in India's growth prospects, and financial stability in the Indian markets.

## Others

3.62  NRI deposits, external commercial borrowings (ECBs), and short-term trade credit have contributed additional buffers to India's capital account, though each component exhibits varying degrees of stability. ECBs have shown an upward trajectory in recent months, with net inflows rising to USD 9.2 billion from April to October 2025, up from USD 2.8 billion in the corresponding period of the previous year, reflecting a greater appetite  for  borrowing  from  foreign  sources.  Similarly,  Non-Resident  Indian  (NRI) deposits have also surged significantly, with net inflows increasing to USD 10.2 billion during H1 of FY25, compared to USD 5.4 billion in the same period of the previous year. This growth can be attributed to continued strong remittance inflows and a favourable exchange rate environment, which incentivised NRIs to park their savings in India.

## Foreign Exchange Reserves

3.63  India's foreign exchange reserves comprise foreign currency assets (FCA), gold, special drawing rights (SDRs) and reserve tranche position (RTP) in the IMF. After surpassing the USD 700 billion benchmark, India's foreign exchange reserves moderated to USD 640.3 billion as of the end of December 2024. The reserves are sufficient to

cover  approximately  90  per  cent  of  India's  external  debt  of  USD  711.8  billion  as  of September 2024, reflecting a strong buffer against external vulnerabilities. As of 2024, India has secured its place among the world's largest foreign exchange reserve-holding countries, ranking 4th globally, following China, Japan, and Switzerland. Supported by net positive capital inflows, India's forex reserves witnessed a notable increase of USD 27.1 billion in 2024. FCA constituted the bulk of this increase, strengthening India's overall reserve position.

3.64   The import cover, a crucial indicator of external sector stability, stood at 10.9 months as of December 2024. This increase enhances India's ability to weather external shocks, with reserve adequacy significantly surpassing the IMF's recommended threemonth import cover for emerging economies. 99  The BoP surplus of USD 63.7 billion in FY24, supplemented by a modest valuation gain of USD 4.3 billion, was the key driver of this improvement. In H1 of FY25, forex reserves rose by USD 59.4 billion, driven by a BoP surplus of USD 23.9 billion and a valuation gain of USD 35.5 billion.

3.65   A  global  rise  in  uncertainty  has  led  to  fluctuations  in  the  composition  of foreignexchange reserves. CY24 saw gold bullion holdings nearing their highest level since World War II, which was largely driven by an accumulation of gold by emerging market central banks. 100  As per the IMF, steady changes are underway in the global reserve  system,  including  a  gradual  movement  away  from  dollar  dominance  and  a rising role of non-traditional currencies. 101

## Exchange Rate

3.66   The  value  of  the  Indian  Rupee  (INR)  is  market-determined, with no target or specific level or band. Various domestic and global factors influence the exchange rate of the INR, such as the movement of the Dollar Index, trends in capital flows, level of interest rates, movement in crude prices, current account deficit, etc. In the first nine months of FY25 (up to 6 January 2025), the INR depreciated a modest 2.9 per cent, performing better than currencies such as the Canadian Dollar, South Korean Won and the Brazilian Real, which depreciated by 5.4 per cent, 8.2 per cent and 17.4 per cent, respectively, during the same period. One of the primary factors behind the rupee depreciation during 2024 has been the broad-based strengthening of the USD amidst geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and uncertainty surrounding the US election.

3.67  After adopting the floating exchange rate regime, Effective exchange rates have become a prominent measure of external competitiveness of an economy's tradable sector  relative  to  the  foreign  tradable  sector.  The  Nominal  Effective  Exchange  Rate (NEER)  for  the  INR  remained  stable  in  the  90-92  range  from  April  to  November 2024, indicating relative stability in the currency amidst external uncertainties. The Real  Effective  Exchange  Rate  (REER),  which  reflects  the  real  purchasing  power  of the  currency,  steadily  appreciated  from  103.2  in  April  2024  to  107.2  in  December 2024.

## External debt position

3.68  India's external debt has remained stable over the past few years. A stable external debt position has helped maintain external sector stability, significantly when the rest of the world is affected by geopolitical headwinds. The external debt to GDP ratio rose slightly from 18.8 per cent of the GDP at the end of June 2024 to 19.4 per cent at the end of September 2024. The share of short-term debt (with original maturity of up to one year) in total external debt decreased to 18.8 per cent at the end of September 2024 from 19.4 per cent at the end of June 2024. Similarly, its ratio to foreign exchange reserves decreased to 18.9 per cent at the end of September 2024 from 20.3 per cent at the end of June 2024. Across currencies, the external debt remained primarily denominated in the US Dollar (53.4 per cent), followed by the INR (31.2 per cent), SDR (5 per cent), and the Euro (3 per cent).

## OUTLOOK

3.69   India's  external  sector  has  performed  well  amidst  unfavourable  geopolitical conditions. On the current account front, though merchandise exports have displayed moderate  growth  owing  to  a  slowdown  in  external  demand,  merchandise  imports have shown remarkable growth supported by strong domestic demand. Increased net services receipts and growing remittances have cushioned the rise in the merchandise trade deficit. On the capital front, the economy has been witnessing net positive capital inflows. Gross FDI inflows have shown a higher growth in the first eight months of FY25 compared to the corresponding period of the previous year. However, a surge in repatriation has reined in the expansion in net FDI. FPI inflows have shown volatility in the first nine months of FY25, showing mixed trends.

3.70  Global trade dynamics have changed significantly in recent years, shifting from globalisation to rising trade protectionism, accompanied by increased uncertainty. This calls for a new strategic trade roadmap for India. To remain competitive and enhance its participation in global supply chains, India must continue reducing trade costs and improving facilitation to boost export competitiveness. Much remains to be done to enhance trade competitiveness. The good news is that doing so is entirely in our hands. On its part, the industry must continue to invest in quality.

3.71   The state produces governance, and the private sector produces goods and services. If both these actors focus on quality and efficiency, then despite the trade tensions and protectionism that are likely to come in the way of expanding global trade, India can increase its share in overseas markets and generate resources to sustain a higher level of capital formation. Then, it will be possible for us not just to dream of but actually realise higher economic growth rates on a sustained basis.
