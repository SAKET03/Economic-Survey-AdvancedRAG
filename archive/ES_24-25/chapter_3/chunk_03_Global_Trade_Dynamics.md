## GLOBAL TRADE DYNAMICS

3.6 Disruptions in the Red Sea that began in November 2023 have forced changes in trade routes, causing higher shipping costs and longer delivery times. 9 This is particularly true for trade between Asia and Europe, as 40 per cent of this trade passes through the Red Sea region. 10  Similar conflicts in the Hormuz Strait, which channels 21 per cent of global petroleum liquid consumption, have disrupted energy trade and increased prices. Additionally, climate change is enhancing the uncertainties. 11  For instance, the recent drought in the Panama Canal jeopardised international trade, affecting approximately 5 per cent of global maritime trade volumes that transit through it. These conditions are creating uncertainty, leading to a slowdown in international trade, 12  reshaping the contours of trade in terms of a rise in protectionist trade policies and shifting global supply chains.

- 3.7 As evident from Chart III.2, there has been a noticeable rise in the political proximity of trade since late 2022. This indicates a preference for bilateral trade between countries with similar geopolitical stances, i.e., friend-shoring 13 and nearshoring. 14  Concurrently, there has been an increasing concentration of global trade 15  to favour significant trade relationships. For instance, Russia and China's trade dependence on the EU and the US's dependence on China has declined in recent years. In contrast, the dependence of Russia and Vietnam on China has increased. 16,17
- 3.8 Government interventions, including NTMs, reinforce the change in bilateral trade patterns due to geopolitical considerations. The rise in NTMs, which began after the COVID-19 pandemic, was further fuelled by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. A report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 18 indicates that technical NTMs impact over 30 per cent of products and nearly 70 per cent of global trade. This is discussed further in paras 3.15 to 3.20 of this chapter.

## Global trade performance in 2024

3.9 According to the latest trade update by UNCTAD 19 , the gradual increase in global trade that began in H2 of 2023 has persisted into 2024. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) database shows a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 3.5 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, in global merchandise export and import indices in Q3 of 2024 (seasonally adjusted, 2005 Q1=100). Further, the global services exports and imports grew by 7.9 per cent and 6.7 per cent (YoY) during the same period.

3.10 Over the last four quarters, trade growth in developing countries generally exceeded that  of  developed  nations.  However,  this  trend  reversed  in  Q3  of  2024,  with  positive developments in developed economies driving trade growth. In contrast, trade growth in East Asia stalled, and several major Asian developing economies experienced negative growth.

3.11  According  to  the  UNCTAD  nowcast 20 ,  the  positive  momentum  in  global  trade witnessed in the first three quarters of 2024 is expected to continue into Q4. As a result, global trade is set to exceed its 2022 record, reaching nearly USD 33 trillion in 2024. This record high is likely to be driven by a 7 per cent increase in services trade (YoY), while goods trade is projected to grow by about 2 per cent in 2024 but remain below its 2022 peak. Overall, global trade is expected to expand by about USD 1 trillion (or 3.3 per cent) in 2024, with goods and services contributing approximately USD 500 billion each.

## Tariff policies

3.12 To promote free trade, encourage investment, and lower trading costs, countries worldwide have established various trade agreements. The number of regional trade agreements (RTAs) in effect has grown substantially, increasing from 22 in 1990 to 369 as of August 2024. 21  Increased emphasis on free trade and enhanced collaboration in international trade policies under the WTO has reduced border tariffs among nations. For instance, between 2000 and 2024, the average tariff rates on dutiable items in India  decreased  from  48.9  per  cent  to  17.3  per  cent,  while  in  China,  they  fell  from 16.4 per cent to 8.3 per cent. 22   Commodity-wise, between 2012 and 2022, the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) and preferential tariffs declined in agriculture, manufacturing, and natural resources. Globally, the simple average MFN and preferential tariffs for agriculture dropped by approximately 3 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, between 2012 and 2022. The simple average preferential tariffs decreased by about 1 per cent in the manufacturing sector.

3.13 At a broader level, India's import tariff policy has evolved over time, balancing domestic policy goals with the need to integrate into the global economy. Tariffs vary by sector, with considerations like protecting sensitive sectors from foreign competition and permitting access to important raw materials and intermediate goods. India has ensured that tariff policies comply with WTO rules and regulations. Over time, several efforts have been made to rationalise tariffs further and address the inverted duty structures.

3.14 Tariffs  are  often  perceived  to  have  an  impact  on  competitiveness.  However,  if used in a calibrated way, tariffs can aid the goals of industrial policy and help in the development of desirable sectors in the economy (Box III.1).

## Box III.1: Tariffs and successful industrial policy design

Industrial policy refers to measures that target the transformation of an industry in pursuit of a public goal. Tariffs are a standard tool of industrial policy and are often seen as a way to support fledgling industries before they gain traction. However, using tariffs requires a calibrated approach which balances the sector's needs with the costs imposed on the rest of the economy. Tariffs can also be viewed as a lever within a system of tools that can further the goals of industrialisation.

The use of tariffs in industrial policy can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution. Tariffs were commonly used in Western Europe and North America to catch up with the British industrial revolution. As Matthew C. Klein and Michael Pettis note in their book 'Trade wars are class wars',

'Freidrich List, who moved from Germany to America in 1825, wrote that a country such as Germany, which was less developed but 'possesses the mental and material means' to become wealthy, should instead avoid free trade and 'strengthen her own individual powers.' … The United States levied tariffs on manufactured goods of about 45 per cent from 1870 through 1913…American manufacturers were protected from foreigners but competed within the large-and expanding-domestic market.'

This accords with the observations made by Professor Robert C. Allen on the development history  of  Europe  and  North  America 23 .  According  to  him,  North  America  and  Western Continental  Europe  caught  up  with  the  British  industrial  revolution  by  adopting  the following:

-     Internal free market (elimination of internal tariffs)-national single market
-   Stable domestic banking system
-   High external tariff
-   Universal Education
-   Infrastructure.

They did not catch up with Britain practising free trade and open capital markets.

Globally,  modern-day  industrial  policies  use  a  mix  of  policies,  including  tariff-based protection and other levers such as credit grants and export-related subsidies. 24  Illustrative of this fact, tariffs accounted for just 1.3 per cent of all industrial policy interventions between 2010 and 2022. 25

Lessons in successful industrial policy design can be gleaned from the support the Korean government extended to its heavy chemicals industry in the Seventies. Korean industrial policy in the heavy chemicals sector led to significant gains in output, labour productivity and long-term comparative advantage of the industry's exports. Tools such as tariff-based protection and quantitative restrictions were used for a limited period, after which protection

tapered in the 1980s. 26  Importantly, in Korea, tariffs were only one element of a composite industrial policy which sought to protect domestic industry and, at the same time, demanded a reciprocal performance obligation on the part of the industry receiving protection.

The  recipe  for  a  successful  industrial  policy  lies  in  the  simultaneous  use  of  carrots  and sticks, with the sticks often being longer than the carrots. Taking a comprehensive look at the industrial policies of Northeast Asia, Joe Studwell wrote in 'How Asia Works' that the region succeeded with its industrial policy because it punished non-performers more than it rewarded performers. As Studwell notes, the emphasis on infant industry protection in Northeast Asian economies went hand in hand with external benchmarking through export performance. There were special privileges for local businesses, but there was accountability for  export  performance.  That  is  how  scale,  productivity,  efficiency  and  rapid  economic growth were achieved. Studwell repeatedly notes that Korean industrial policy punished its non-performers more than helped performers.

To summarise, the growth experiences of the industrialised West and the miracle growth economies of the East suggest that tariffs were indeed a prominent tool used to further industrialisation. However, tariffs were used in a calibrated way, and a whole-of-government approach  was  adopted  in  crafting  tariff  policies.  Finally,  industrial  policy  goals  were achieved not by protection alone but by policies which ensured that the protected industries performed in response to the protection afforded.

## Non-tariff measures

3.15   The decline in tariffs globally, as discussed above, has been accompanied by an increase in the implementation of NTMs 27  across countries. The Global Trade Alert database 28   shows that between 2020 and 2024, over 26,000 new restrictions related to  trade  and  investments  have  been  globally  imposed.  This  is  further  elucidated  in Chapter 5. The Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) affect 31.6 per cent of the product lines, covering 67.1 per cent of the global trade (as of December 2024). This is followed by export-related measures, affecting 19.3 per cent of the product lines and covering 31.2 per cent of the global trade. Sectors most affected by NTMs include agriculture, manufacturing, and natural resources. 29

27    UNCTAD  defines  NTMs  as  policy  measures  that  are  not  ordinary  customs  tariffs  but  can  still  significantly impact  international  trade  in  goods.  These  measures  can  affect  either  the  quantities  traded,  prices,  or  both (Classification  of  NTMs  |  UNCTAD).  NTMs  are  classified  into  import-related  and  export-related  categories based on the above classification. Import-related NTMs are further classified as 'technical' or 'non-technical.' Technical measures comprise sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), technical barriers to trade (TBT), and pre-shipment inspections. Non-technical measures encompass traditional trade policies like quotas, subsidies,

and trade remedies, including those addressing unfair trade practices. In 2006, the UNCTAD established the Group of Eminent Persons on Non-tariff Barriers (NTBs) and the MultiAgency Support Team (MAST) comprising eight international organisations such as the IMF, OECD, UNIDO), UNCTAD, the World Bank and WTO etc. Over the years, MAST has created a coding system as a foundation for  collecting  and  tallying  NTMs.  The  objective  of  the  International  Classification  of  NTMs  (refer:  UNCTAD report on International Classification of Non-Tariff Measures, https://tinyurl.com/mr3mp5uk) was to provide

information and clarification on new and existing measures and to improve their comparability across countries.

Note: Other includes 'Pre-shipment inspection and other formalities, contingent trade protective measures, non-automatic import licensing,  quotas,  prohibitions,  quantity-control  measures  and  other  restrictions  not including sanitary and phytosanitary measures or measures relating to technical barriers to trade, measures affecting competition, trade-related investment measures, distribution restrictions, restrictions on post-sales services, subsidies and other forms of supports, government procurement restrictions, intellectual property and rules of origin. The frequency index is defined as the percentage of HS 6-digit lines covered. The coverage ratio is defined as the percentage of trade that is subject to NTMs

3.16   Globally,  NTMs,  such  as  subsidies  and  export-related  measures,  have  risen  in aid of nations' industrial policy goals. 30   Unlike broad-based tariffs, NTMs tend to be granular in their approach. 31 They are often less visible, making them harder to assess. 32

3.17    A  report  by  UNCTAD and the UNESCAP 33  shows evidence of increased use of NTMs by countries  to  adapt  and  mitigate  climate  change.  According  to  the  report, although climate change-related NTMs account for only 2.6 per cent of total measures, they  are  concentrated  in  some  of  the  largest  and  most  CO2-intensive  trade  sectors, such as the automotive industry, electricity and heat generation, transformation, and storage. As a result, 26.4 per cent of global trade, valued at USD 6.5 trillion, is covered by climate-change-related NTMs. TBT comprise over 61 per cent of all identified climate change-related NTMs, followed by export-related and price-control measures (as of December 2024). In the future, the imposition of climate-change-related NTMs by the EU in the form of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) 34  and European

34    CBAM is the EU's tool to put a fair price on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon-intensive goods that are entering the EU and to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries.

Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) 35  is anticipated to have broad implications for  exporters  in  emerging  economies such as China, India, and Turkey. 36 Box  III.2 discusses CBAM and EUDR and their possible impact on India's exports in detail.

## Box III.2: CBAM and EUDR and their likely impact on India's exports

## Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

Implemented by the EU and under consideration by the UK, CBAM aims to align the cost of carbon emissions for imported goods with that of domestically produced products. As countries/groups  like  the  EU  phase  out  the  free  allowances  they  offer  their  industries under the Emissions Trading System (ETS), they are ushering in CBAM to prevent their consumption from shifting to countries with relatively softer environmental regulations. Under the mechanism, importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price paid by the domestic producers/manufacturers under the EU's carbon pricing rules. Thus, CBAM is effectively a carbon price equalisation measure.

The key sectors covered under the EU CBAM include iron and steel, aluminium, cement, and fertilisers. Reporting requirements for the EU CBAM began on 1 January 2024, with quarterly submissions for the previous quarter. The levy, however, is expected to take effect from 1 January 2026. The UK has also proposed its own CBAM, scheduled to come into force on 1 January 2027, reflecting a broader global shift towards carbon pricing mechanisms. The key sectors covered under the UK CBAM include cement, fertilisers, glass, ceramics, iron and steel, aluminium, and hydrogen. Currently, the EU CBAM addresses only direct emissions from production processes, whereas the proposed UK CBAM intends to cover both direct and indirect emissions. CBAM aims to equalise carbon prices across geographies, thereby negating the comparative advantage of developing members like India and the least developed countries.

The justification offered for the introduction of CBAM is that it prevents carbon leakage. 37 Some jurisdictions believe that the aggregate impact of the countries' nationally determined contributions, if fully implemented, would not put the world on a pathway to achieving the Paris Agreement goal. Therefore, the logic behind CBAM is that as long as they did not have the same level of ambition, CBAM was necessary to protect the integrity of climate mitigation efforts in Europe and ensure they were not undermined by carbon leakage. Moreover, the

35    The EUDR requires operators and traders to ensure that the products placed in the EU market are (i) deforestationfree (i.e., must not be derived from a land which is deforested after December 31 2020); (ii) should be produced following the relevant legislation of the country where the product is produced; and (iii) covers the submission of a due diligence statement before placing the products in the EU.

proposed ban on steel scrap exports from the EU, a key input for steel production, will significantly hinder developing countries' capacity to produce more carbon-efficient steel. This measure can be perceived as the EU attempting to enjoy the benefits of both sides while also imposing trade restrictions.

## Likely impact on India

The share of CBAM exports in total Indian exports to the EU has increased substantially from 6.3 per cent in 2014 to 10.5 per cent in 2023. 38  Table III.1 presents the commodity-wise exposure of India's exports to the EU, which are likely to be impacted by CBAM.

According  to  the  World  Bank's  Relative  CBAM  Exposure  Index 39 ,  India  has  a  score  of 0.03, reflecting a high exposure to CBAM. 40  Countries like India face the twin challenge of  achieving  higher  levels  of  economic  development  and  dealing  with  climate  change mitigation and adaptation. Therefore, the international community must find a balance that supports both environmental sustainability and the economic development needs of developing economies and LDCs, ensuring that multilateralism remains the cornerstone of global trade relations. 41

## European Union Deforestation Regulation

The EUDR (whose implementation will start at the end of 2025 and in 2026 for smaller businesses) seeks to regulate the consumption of products derived from deforested land. The EUDR places several compliances on the operators and traders of the relevant products

38    'Intermingling  of  Trade  and  Environment  Policy:  Implications  of  EU-CBAM  on  India  and  LDCs',  EPW,  16 November 2024 https://tinyurl.com/yb32jhdp.

39    CBAM exposure index is measured as the mathematical product of two main elements-the share of a country's exports of the CBAM-related product that goes to the EU and the embodied carbon payment per dollar of export to  the  EU,  determined  by  the  carbon  emissions  intensity  of  production  and  the  assumed  cost  of  the  CBAM certificates.CBAM exposure index is measured by multiplying the export share by the embodied carbon payment per dollar of export to the EU (the exporter's emission intensity times $100 per ton carbon price).

covered  under  the  regulation. 42 It  requires  the  operators  and  traders  to  ensure  that  the products placed in the EU market are (i) deforestation-free (i.e., must not be derived from a land which is deforested after December 31 2020); (ii) should be produced by the relevant legislation of the country where the product is produced; and (iii) covers the submission of a due diligence statement, including supply chain integrity through an elaborate trace and track system before placing the products in the EU.

The regulation also entails  devising  a  country-level  benchmarking  system  indicating  the forest degradation and deforestation risk by the EU. The benchmarking system would be based on a three-tier system for classifying countries as low, standard, or high risk, which would be determined based on internationally recognised information and data on whether a  country  is  active  in  reducing  deforestation.  High-risk  countries  would  be  required  to exercise higher due diligence for the relevant products compared to low or standard-risk countries.  This categorisation of countries would be used to identify the checks to be carried out by the EU authorities. High-risk countries would be subject to more rigorous checks than countries categorised as having low-risk. 43

The regulation covers products such as soy, beef, palm oil, wood, cocoa, coffee, rubber, and their derived products, such as leather, chocolate, tyres, or furniture. 44 It puts the onus of proving compliance on the operator or trader who wishes to sell these products in the EU markets. 45 The costs of complying with the regulation include information requirements, risk assessment, risk mitigation and reporting obligations. These costs are not border measures but affect the competitiveness of a country's exports vis-à-vis other countries' compliance costs. Therefore, the Regulation would change the trade costs (increase) for the EU's trading partners in specific commodities.

As per a GTRI study 46 , as far as India's exports are concerned, coffee, leather hide and skin preparations, oil  cake,  paper,  paperboard,  and  wood  furniture  could  be  highly  impacted by the Regulation. It also compares the tariff lines covered under the Regulation vis-à-vis

42    The  Regulation defines an 'operator' as natural or legal person who, in the course of a commercial activity, places relevant products on the market or exports them and a 'trader' as any person in the supply chain other than the operator who, in the course of a commercial activity, makes relevant products available on the market.

43    As  per  the  Regulation  dated  31  May  2023,  'In  respect  of  relevant  products  from  countries  or  parts  thereof classified  as  high  risk,  the  respective  operators  and  traders  and  the  volumes  of  their  share  of  relevant commodities and relevant products, a twofold approach that provides comprehensive coverage should apply. Competent authorities should thus be required to check on a certain percentage of operators and traders, whilst also covering a specific percentage of relevant products. In respect of relevant products from countries or parts thereof classified as low or standard risk, competent authorities should be required to check at least a certain percentage of operators and traders. The level of checks should be higher for relevant products from high-risk countries or parts thereof whereas it could be lower for standard or low-risk countries or parts thereof.'

44    The list of products covered under the Regulation is available at Annex I of the Regulation dated 31 May 2023, available at https://tinyurl.com/bddmuysp.

45    Article 2 (15) of the Regulation states, 'An operator is a natural or legal person who places relevant products on the Union market or exports them from the Union market in the course of commercial activity.'

CBAM, out of which the latter is wider in its coverage. The CBAM and EUDR are expected to affect USD 9.5 billion of India's exports to the EU, which amounts to 9 per cent of India's exports to the world or 12.9 per cent of India's exports to the EU. The study informs that the regulation effectively encourages local production and export of selected agricultural commodities by erecting more barriers against imports in the name of climate.

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, around 420 million hectares of forest were lost globally due to deforestation between 1990 and 2020, an area the  size  of  the  EU. 47 In  Europe,  conversion  to  cropland  accounted  for  about  15  per  cent of deforestation during the same time period. 48  European agriculture could not have come up without deforestation, and the imposition of EUDR reeks of double standards. Thus, that  a  region  that  has  resorted  to  significant  deforestation  to  expand  crop  production  is implementing the EUDR to regulate the consumption of products sourced from deforested land, appears quite contradictory, even as it is unsurprising.

In short, it is hard to shake off the conclusion that both CBAM and EUDR are trade protection measures garbed in the language of climate and environment. The game and the end goals are the same, but the tactics keep changing. Labour standards, gender, democracy, emissions and deforestation, the innovative list will keep evolving with time. Institutions and practices evolve  with  development.  Today's  developed  countries  do  not  conform  to  the  standards that  they  expect  from  developing  countries  at  a  similar  stage  of  development.  But  then, intellectual consistency is not really the goal here.

3.18  NTMs are playing an increasing role in international trade due to a decline in the usage of tariffs worldwide via successive agreements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/WTO and due to growing consumer concerns about food safety, quality, and environmental protection. 49  A UNCTAD report 50  notes that NTMs can serve as legitimate policy instruments, fulfilling important roles such as protecting human health and the environment. In some cases, they may even enhance trade. For instance, when an exporting  country  implements  high  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  standards, consumers in importing countries tend to have greater confidence in the quality of the food products, which can lead to increased demand. Stricter domestic food safety standards can also help local exporters meet the requirements of their trade partners, further boosting trade opportunities.

3.19 Though many NTMs aim primarily to protect public health or the environment, they also adversely impact trade by increasing information, compliance, and procedural costs. This is significant for exporters and importers because accessing and benefiting from markets increasingly depends on adherence to trade regulations, such as sanitary

standards  and  product  quality  requirements.  For  instance,  a  regulation  that  limits pesticide residues in food products seeks to achieve a significant public health goal of protecting human health and nutrition. However, this regulation imposes additional compliance  requirements  on  firms  in  exporting  countries,  and  some  may  find  that exporting  is  no  longer  profitable.  Consequently,  such  regulations  can  restrict  trade, leading to lower incomes in exporting countries and higher prices for consumers in importing  countries.  This  issue  mainly  affects  smaller  exporters  and  low-income countries, as they often bear a disproportionate burden from these NTMs. 51

3.20  NTMs can indirectly affect FDI through their impact on imports. A firm might decide to bypass an NTM by engaging in FDI if the costs associated with this approach are lower than the costs of exporting. Additionally, NTMs can encourage inward FDI to the country that imposes them, as these measures raise barriers to market access. Research has demonstrated that NTMs have a positive impact on FDI. For example, if the average number of NTMs applied to a product increases from 2.5 to 3.5 NTMs per product, FDI could increase by 12 per cent. Certain NTMs, such as intellectual property rights, local content requirements, and TBT in specific sectors, appear to affect FDI significantly. 52
