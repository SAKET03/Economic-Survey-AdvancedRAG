# Financial Intermediation

## FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION

2.8 Financial intermediaries are critical in implementing and transmitting monetary policy actions. Policy rates set by the MPC are transmitted to the real economy through financial intermediaries adjusting their lending and deposit rates. Similarly, the CRR and SLR requirements influence the lending capacity of the financial intermediaries. All these policy rates/ratios, in effect, have a bearing on the economic growth, price levels and financial stability of the economy.  The performance of financial intermediaries, such  as  banks,  capital  markets,  insurance,  pension  sector,  etc.,  is  discussed  in  this chapter section.

## Improvement in asset quality of banks

2.9 The GNPA ratio of SCBs has declined consistently from its peak in FY18 to a 12year low of 2.6 per cent at the end of September 2024. Lower slippages and a reduction in  outstanding  GNPAs  through  recoveries,  upgradations,  and  write-offs  have  led  to this decrease. Lower GNPAs and higher provisions accumulated in recent years also contributed to a decline in net NPAs at around 0.6 per cent at the end of September 2024. Improvements in asset quality parameters were observed across all major bank groups.

2.10  The restructured standard advances (RSA) ratio, which is the share of RSA in total gross loans and advances, for SCBs declined from 1.8 per cent at the end of March 2022 to 0.7 per cent at the end of September 2024. All major bank groups reported a decrease in this ratio. The CRAR of SCBs has increased in the post-asset quality review period, which was conducted from August to November 2015. For FY24, around 93 per cent of the increase in the capital funds was contributed by the rise in Tier-I capital of banks, indicative of the robustness of capital buffers. At the end of September 2024, the CRAR of SCBs stood at 16.7 per cent, and all banks met the Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-1) requirement of 8 per cent.

2.11   The profitability of SCBs improved during H1 of FY25, with profit after tax (PAT) surging  by  22.2  per  cent  (YoY).  The  cost  of  funds  rose  in  sync  with  the  tightening monetary policy cycle. During Q2 of FY25, the cost of funds increased marginally for SCBs. As the transmission was faster for lending rates relative to deposit rates and the overall yield on assets remained broadly stable during the last year, the net interest

margin (NIM) has marginally declined across all bank groups. Despite a contraction in NIM, both return on equity (RoE) and return on assets (RoA) ratios improved in September 2024. Further, as the GNPAs and slippages declined, the provision coverage ratio improved further to 77 per cent at the end of September 2024 per cent from 74.9 per cent in March 2023.

## Trends in bank credit

2.12  Against the backdrop of the recent monetary policy tightening cycle in India, bank deposits continue to exhibit double-digit growth. However, their profile has gradually shifted towards schemes offering higher returns. Growth in term deposits continues to outpace the current and savings account deposit growth. As of the end of November 2024, the YoY growth in aggregate deposits of SCBs stood at 11.1 per cent. The growth in bank credit has started converging towards deposit growth. At the end of November 2024, the growth in overall bank credit moderated to 11.8 per cent (YoY) from 15.2 per cent a year ago over the same period. 5  Moreover, the growth in overall bank credit up to 27 December 2024 in the current financial year moderated to 7.7 per cent.

2.13  In the current financial year, up to 27 December 2024, the growth rate in non-food credit has been 7.5 per cent compared to a growth of 11 per cent over the same period last year. The moderation in credit growth can be attributed to an increase in lending rates (as a result of monetary policy transmission of higher policy rates to higher lending rates)  and  the  imposition  of  increased  capital  requirements  for  unsecured  personal loans, credit cards and lending to Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) by the

2.14   Sector-wise,  the  growth  in  agriculture  credit  as  of  29  November  2024  in  the current financial year was 5.1 per cent. The growth in industrial credit picked up and stood at 4.4 per cent as of the end of November 2024, higher than 3.2 per cent recorded a  year  ago.  Across  industries,  bank  credit  to  micro,  small,  and  medium  enterprises (MSMEs) have been growing faster than credit disbursal to large enterprises. As of the end of November 2024, credit to MSMEs registered a YoY growth of 13 per cent, whereas it stood at 6.1 per cent for large enterprises. Credit growth to the services and personal loans segments also moderated to 5.9 per cent and 8.8 per cent, respectively, as of the end of November 2024 in the current financial year. Amongst the services sector, the moderation has been driven by a slowdown in credit disbursal to NBFCs. Vehicle  and  housing  loans  drove  the  moderation  in  the  personal  loans  segment.  In terms of increasing risk weights to NBFCs and credit cards, RBI's policy interventions contributed to the moderation of credit growth in those segments.

2.15    In  December  2024  MPC,  the  RBI  announced  an  increase  in  the  interest  rate ceiling on Foreign Currency Non-Resident [FCNR(B)] deposits with maturities of 1 to 3 years and 3 to 5 years. 7   Accordingly, banks can now garner fresh deposits under these categories by offering a higher rate of interest. It has also decided to link the foreign exchange retail platform with the Bharat Connect platform to enhance access to foreign exchange for MSMEs. These measures will not only help banks attract investible funds for credit growth but will also help attract more foreign inflows into India. Another

significant measure to improve credit access for small and marginal farmers includes increasing the limit for collateral-free agricultural loans from ₹1.6 lakh to ₹2 lakh. 8

2.16   The  credit/GDP ratio is a good statistic to evaluate where an economy stands in the financial cycle. 9 If  the ratio is significantly greater than its trend value, it may indicate a build-up of stress in the lending sector. On the other hand, if the ratio is lower compared to its trend, it indicates ample room for growth. In the case of India, there was a positive credit/GDP gap (i.e., the difference between the credit-GDP ratio and its long-term trend) between 2006 and 2012, indicating excessive credit growth. This also coincided with the investment boom over that period. A bust followed this in the credit cycle; higher NPAs impaired the banking sector's lending ability, leading to a significant slowdown in credit growth.

2.17   After tiding over this situation and the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, an upward trend in the credit/GDP ratio is observed, with the gap steadily closing. With credit growth outpacing nominal GDP growth for two successive years, the credit-GDP gap narrowed to (-) 0.3 per cent in Q1 of FY25 from (-) 10.3 per cent in Q1 of FY23. Therefore, despite the double-digit growth in bank credit post-April 2022, the creditto-GDP ratio is below the trend line, indicating that the recent growth in bank credit is sustainable.

2.19   Although  pockets  of  stress  have  appeared  lately,  as  we  shall  see  later,  India's credit landscape highlights the recovery in the credit environment from the crisis of the second decade, now trying to consolidate itself. At the heart of this growth lies a strong policy emphasis on financial inclusion, as reflected in the significant rise in RBI's Financial Inclusion Index 12  from 53.9 in March 2021 to 64.2 by March 2024. The next section explores the crucial role of Rural Financial Intermediaries (RFIs) in closing the gap between financial services and underserved regions, thereby advancing financial inclusion across the country.

## Rural Financial Institutions

2.20   RFIs  are  vital  in  ensuring  inclusive  growth  through  financial  inclusion,  credit accessibility, agricultural financing, and empowerment of rural entrepreneurs. These institutions comprise a network of organisations that provide banking and financial services in rural areas. This multi-agency system includes Regional Rural Banks (RRBs), Rural Cooperative Banks (RCBs), SCBs, Small Finance Banks, NBFCs, Micro Finance Institutions, and local area banks. The system supports rural India through a network of banking outlets, which include branches and banking correspondents. The National

12   The index measures progress achieved in financial inclusion across 97 indicators in three dimensions: access, usage, and quality of financial services.

Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) oversees the performance and health of RRBs and RCBs, focusing on aspects such as growth, the composition of assets and liabilities, business structure (deposits and loans), and profitability indicators.

2.21  RRBs were established in 1975 under the Regional Rural Banks Act of 1976. Starting from an initial number of five in 1975, they have significantly expanded in reach, branch count, total deposits, and advances. There were 133 RRBs in 2006. Following certain mergers, liquidations, and amalgamations to improve their performance, the number was brought down to 43 in 2023. Their coverage expanded from 523 districts in 2006 to 696 districts, and the number of branches grew substantially from 14,494 in 2006 to 21,856 in 2023. As of 31 March 2024, there were 43 RRBs (sponsored by 12 SCBs) with 22,069 branches, with operations extending to 31.3 crore deposit accounts and 3 crore loan accounts in 26 states and 3 UTs. 13

2.22  The government approved ₹10,890 crore in recapitalisation assistance to RRBs during  FY22  and  FY23. 14   This  recapitalisation  scheme  included  operational  and governance reforms as part of the Sustainable Viability Plan designed to revitalise RRBs. The  plan  aimed  to  achieve  several  objectives,  including  credit  expansion,  business diversification,  reduction  of  NPAs,  cost  rationalisation,  technology  adoption,  and improvements in corporate governance. As a result of this recapitalisation assistance and the implementation of the viability plan, the performance of RRBs at a consolidated level has shown significant improvement over time. During FY24, these banks achieved historic highs across all metrics. The consolidated net profit of RRBs increased from ₹4,974 crore in FY23 to ₹7,571 crore in FY24. The consolidated CRAR rose from 13.4 per cent as of March 2023 to an all-time high of 14.2 per cent by March 31, 2024. The number of RRBs with a CRAR of less than 9 per cent decreased from 9 as of March 2023 to 4 as of March 2024. Additionally, the number of profit-making RRBs grew from 37 in FY23 to 40 in FY24, while the number of loss-making RRBs fell from 6 to 3 during the same period.

2.23   Asset  quality  of  RRBs  measured  by  GNPA  as  a  percentage  of  gross  advances improved from 7.3 per cent in FY23 to 6.1 per cent in FY24, which is the lowest level in the past 10 years. During the same period, net NPAs declined from 3.2 per cent to 2.4 per cent. Credit expansion contributed to an increase in the consolidated creditto-deposit ratio, which rose from 67.5 per cent as of March 2023 to 71.2 per cent as of March 2024, the highest in 33 years. All RRBs successfully met the regulatory targets and  sub-targets  set  by  the  RBI  under  the  Priority  Sector  Lending  (PSL)  guidelines during FY24.

## Development Financial Institutions

2.24  DFIs are key players in supporting economic progress. Their main objective is to  boost  economic  expansion  through  funding  infrastructure  developments.  These institutions  offer  extended  financial  and  technical  aid  across  different  sectors.  DFIs supply technical assistance, including reports on projects, studies on their feasibility, and advisory services.  By  improving  access  to  credit  for  infrastructure  and  housing projects, DFIs encourage more loans to be directed towards these critical areas. DFIs play a vital role in India by providing long-term funding for key sectors, supporting economic growth, fostering industrial expansion, improving infrastructure, and helping develop small and medium-sized businesses.

2.25  The early DFIs were set up in the 1950s to 1960s. They included the Industrial Financial Corporation of India (IFCI), Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) and Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI). Over time, these DFIs  became  universal  banks  or  commercial  banks.  As  two  major  DFIs  converted into  commercial  banks,  there  were  fewer  institutions  to  address  the  macro  needs of  industrial  and  infrastructure  development.  Institutions  such  as  Infrastructure Development Finance Company (1997), India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) (2006), and more recently, the National Bank for Financing and Infrastructure Development (NaBFID) (2021) have focused on funding infrastructure development. The performance of some of these is discussed in the following paras.

2.26  IIFCL has supported India's infrastructure development over the past 18 years. As a long-term financing institution, it is amongst the most diversified public sector infrastructure  lenders  in  terms  of  eligible  infrastructure  sub-sectors  and  product offerings. It is mandated to finance green-field and brown-field projects, covering direct lending, takeout finance, refinance and credit enhancement across all infrastructure subsectors as notified by the government in the Harmonised Master List of Infrastructure Subsectors. 15 As  of  September  2024,  IIFCL  had  approved  cofinancing  for  over  780 projects with a total outlay of over ₹ 13.9 lakh crore. This includes more than 500 publicprivate  partnership  (PPP)  projects,  representing  about  28  per  cent  of  the  country's total PPP projects. IIFCL's total sanctions and disbursements on a cumulative basis exceed ₹2.8 lakh crore and ₹1.4 lakh crore, respectively, while the outstanding loan book stands at ₹58,995 crore. Overall, IIFCL has accorded loan sanctions to projects having around 31,000 km of highways (22 per cent of India's NH capacity), 95 GW of installed energy capacity (23 per cent of India's installed capacity), 22 GW of installed renewable energy capacity (11 per cent of India's installed renewable capacity) and 880 million tonnes of port capacity (35 per cent of India's total port capacity). 16

2.27  Given the need for a long-term capital provider with a holistic sectoral mandate, as opposed to the niche mandate of other DFIs, the National Bank for Financing and Infrastructure  Development  (NaBFID)  was  established  as  an  infrastructure-focused DFI through NaBFID Act, 2021. The RBI accorded it an 'All India Financial Institution' (AIFI) status on 8 March 2022, making it the fifth AIFI after NABARD, Small Industrial Development Bank of India (SIDBI), NHB and Exim Bank. NaBFID has both financial and developmental objectives. Its financial objective is to lend or invest, directly or indirectly, and seek to attract investment from private sector investors and institutional investors  in  infrastructure  projects  to  foster  sustainable  economic  development  in India. The developmental objective of the institution is to coordinate with the central and state governments, regulators, financial institutions, institutional investors, and other relevant stakeholders.

2.28  NaBFID has sanctioned ₹1.3 lakh crore loans as of 30 September 2024. The road and energy sector, including renewable energy, account for over three-fourths of loans sanctioned.  The  institution  has  identified  a  project  pipeline  across  sectors  such  as roads, power generation, renewables, railways, ports, transmission and distribution, data centres, and social and commercial sectors like hospitals, ropeways, and others. It is targeting sanction (cumulative) of loans aggregating over ₹3 lakh crore by the end of FY26. It offers longer tenor loans (15 to 25 years), longer reset on loans (3 to 5 years), and fixed interest rate loans up to 15 to 25 years, helping infrastructure developers navigate the interest rate cycle and manage risks therein. 17

## Use of Artificial Intelligence by banks

2.29 Over  the  past  several  decades,  banks  have  consistently  adapted  the  latest technological innovations to redefine customer interactions. Globally, banks introduced ATMs in the 1960s and electronic card-based payments in the 1970s. The 2000s saw the widespread adoption of 24/7 online banking, followed by the rise of mobile banking in the 2010s. Now the world is in the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered digital age, driven by decreasing data storage and processing costs, greater accessibility, and connectivity. These innovations can lead to higher automation and often enhance human decisionmaking speed and accuracy when correctly managed to mitigate risks. 18

2.30  The use cases of AI and Machine Learning (ML) applications by banks in India range across areas such as credit underwriting, regulatory capital planning, liquidity management, fraud detection and prevention, risk assessment and management,

17  Ibid note 16.

portfolio optimisation, pricing models, and chatbots. The rapid pace of technological evolution  in  India,  particularly  in  areas  like  AI,  blockchain,  and  data  analytics,  has created new opportunities to reimagine traditional financial services and processes. 19 AI and large language models (LLMs) have enhanced customer service through interactive chatbots  and  personalised  experiences,  while  blockchain  offers  secure,  transparent, and efficient transactions. Moreover, evolving consumer behaviour and expectations, driven by the rise of digital natives and increasing demand for personalised, seamless, and convenient financial solutions, encourage established companies and newcomers to innovate to remain competitive.

2.31  Along with the benefits, using AI in the banking system entails a few risks. The black-box nature of AI systems can make it difficult to assess the system's reliability or contest its decisions. This lack of transparency can lead to trust concerns and challenges in validating the fairness and accuracy of AI decisions, making it challenging to audit or interpret the algorithms that drive the decisions. Accountability risks include difficulty in tracing decisions to their source and establishing liability. Other risks include those related to (i) human resources, such as inadequate human oversight, over-reliance on AI, and loss of human expertise; (ii) cyber risks; (iii) malicious usages like synthetic identity frauds, rogue trading, and market manipulation; (iv) system related risks such as inability to intervene and market correlations; and (v) third-party dependencies and service provider concentration. 20

2.32   International  bodies  such  as  the  Organisation  for  Economic  Cooperation  and Development (OECD) have outlined core principles governing the use of AI 21 , which include inclusive growth, respect for the rule of law, transparency and explainability, robustness and safety, and accountability. The Hiroshima AI Process Comprehensive Policy Framework 22  established in December 2023, includes a set of guiding principles and a code of conduct, marking a significant step towards a coordinated global approach for  the  responsible  development  of  AI.  Different  techniques  are  being  adopted  by regulators across the globe, most of which are focused on principles-based guidance.

2.33  Establishing robust AI governance is the first and crucial step in addressing the challenges that come with the implementation of AI systems. Without an appropriate governance framework, AI systems may operate without clear guidelines or oversight, leading to potential abuse or misuse of technology. As vulnerabilities could evolve with the pace of innovation and degree of AI integration in financial services, regulatory and supervisory effectiveness may take a backseat if financial regulators' AI-related skills

and knowledge do not keep pace with developments in this space. Accordingly, the RBI has proactively engaged with regulated entities and experts to assess the ongoing developments  while  effectively  communicating  its  expectations  through  multiple engagement forums. It has also created a regulatory sandbox focusing on innovative technology  products/services. 23 Further,  the  RBI  announced  the  establishment  of  a committee to create a Framework for Responsible and Ethical Enablement of Artificial Intelligence (FREE-AI) in the financial sector. 24

## Efficacy of Insolvency Law

2.34  While financial intermediaries play their part in providing credit to various agents of the economy for economic activity, debtors may sometimes fail in their endeavours. This requires a mechanism to rescue them and provide an honourable exit to honest debtors or an attempt to resolve the stress and get them back into the business.  For this purpose, enacting the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (IBC/Code) has ushered in a modern and comprehensive insolvency resolution framework for distressed entities. By addressing financial distress and NPAs, the Code has had an indelible impact on the health of the country's banking sector and redefined the debtor-creditor relationship.

2.35  Till September 2024, 1068 resolution plans approved under the Code have resulted in creditors realising ₹3.6 lakh crore, 161 per cent against liquidation value and 86.1 per cent of the fair value (based on 964 cases where fair value has been estimated). The haircut for creditors relative to the fair value of assets was around 14 per cent, while relative to their admitted claims, it was around 69 per cent. 25  Further, until September 2024, 79 corporate debtors (CDs) were closed by sale as a going concern under liquidation. These 79 CDs had cl aims amounting to ₹1.4 lakh crore, as against the liquidation value of ₹4678.2 crore. The liquidators in these cases realised ₹3674.1 crore.

2.36   Resolutions  under  the  Code  have  spanned  across  all  sectors,  from  large  steel manufacturing companies and real estate projects to small FMCG companies. Out of the 12 large accounts referred by the RBI for resolution under the Code, 10 have been successfully  resolved.  This  highlights  that  the  resolution  process  under  the  Code  is designed to be sector-agnostic so that all types of distressed entities can find a viable solution to their financial distress.

2.37  The deterrent effect of the Code has led to a significant shift in debtor behaviour. Thousands of debtors are resolving distress in the early stages of distress. They are

25    This realisation does not include the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP) cost and many probable future  realisations  such  as  equity,  realisation  from  corporate  and  personal  guarantees,  funds  infused  into Corporate  Debtors  (CDs),  including  capital  expenditure  by  the  Resolution  Applicants,  and  recovery  from avoidance applications.

resolving when default is imminent, on receipt of a notice for repayment but before filing an application, after filing application but before its admission, and even after admission of the application, and making best effort to avoid consequences of resolution process. Most companies are rescued at these stages. Till March, 2024, 28,818 applications for initiation of CIRPs of CDs having underlying default of ₹10.2 lakh crore were withdrawn before their admission.

2.38  The outcomes of the IBC in terms of its efficiency and effectiveness are discernible from various statistics such as the number of resolutions, early resolutions before the financial distress becomes chronic, and time taken for the processes to complete, etc. However, beyond these numbers, the Code has other far-reaching  impacts  through its  interaction  with  the  higher-level  systems  like  the  legal,  economic,  and  financial systems. Some of these systemic benefits of the law, flowing through multiple channels, as proven by research, are as follows:

- Forex  hedging  by  firmsResearch  shows  that  the  likelihood  for  currency mismatches in the corporate sector has reduced after India's bankruptcy reform. As per BIS research (2018) 26  the introduction of the new bankruptcy law raised the probability of currency hedging by 13.7 per cent for firms which originally had a high degree of currency mismatch. Thus, there is an incentive for firms to hedge currency exposure risk better in the presence of a bankruptcy law.
- Reducing bond credit spreadsSengupta and Vardhan (2023) 27  highlight that the IBC lowered the credit spreads for bonds issued by non-financial firms from FY17 to FY20 compared to the bonds issued by the finance firms in FY15 and FY16, especially  when  other  issue-level  determinants  of  credit  spreads  are  considered. This shows an encouraging development and reinforces the fact that an effective bankruptcy resolution regime is critical for bond investors to develop confidence in the Indian market. Currently, the bond market is skewed towards high-rated (AAA and AA) bonds, which account for more than 85 per cent of all issuances. Investor confidence in effective bankruptcy resolution will be crucial to developing a deep and liquid market for lower-rated bonds.
- ExportsKhan  and  Chakraborty  (2022) 28 ,  study  a  large  sample  of  4,434  firms between 2000 and 2020 and find that exporting firms in India have benefitted from the bankruptcy reform law by helping them better access credit and get out of financial constraints.
- 2.39  Macroprudential tools are handy for muting the effects of credit cycles. However,

a good bankruptcy regime acts as a backstop during downswings, in turn reducing the need for costly macroprudential interventions. A continuously evolving and improving IBC framework is important to achieving a 7-8 per cent growth over the next decade. India's  growth  aspirations  require  capital  to  operate  at  the  frontiers  of  productivity and  efficiency.  An  efficient  bankruptcy  system  will  free  up  capital,  allowing  better production, employment, and growth prospects.

2.40  The next step towards insolvency and bankruptcy reform is to improve operational efficiencies to speed up the resolution process. This is especially important for MSMEs, for whom legal costs can prove to be substantial. Improving time efficiencies in the system comes down to using innovative resolution routes such as the pre-pack arrangements for  MSMEs,  inter-disciplinary  capacity  building  of  resolution  professionals  across legal,  financial  and  industry  basics  and  minimising  judiciary  delays  in  proceedings. Operational  efficiencies  require  a  balancing  act  between  fairness  and  fastness  of resolution. Further, improvements are also required to ensure the timeliness of the insolvency and bankruptcy processes under the Code. Box II.1 discusses the issue of delays in the processes under the IBC.

## Box II.1: IBC and National Company Law Tribunals

The IBC lays a time limit of 180 days from the date of admission for closure of an insolvency process, with a provision for extension by 90 days with the approval of the committee of creditors (CoC) and the adjudicating authority (AA), i.e., the NCLT. The regulations provide detailed  timelines  for  various  processes  to  be  undertaken  in  the  corporate  insolvency resolution process (CIRP) and liquidation processes. This aspect of the insolvency law has been crucial in determining its performance, and with time, the delays in the completion of processes have become a concern.

Within three years of implementation of the Code, the difficulties in complying with the timelines were evident, and it was amended to provide a 330-day outer limit for a CIRP, including judicial proceedings. Current evidence shows that the 1068 CIRPs, which have yielded resolution plans (as of the end of September 2024), took an average of 582 days (after excluding the time excluded by the AA) for conclusion, and the 2,630 CIRPs, which ended up in orders for liquidation, took on average 499 days for conclusion. This average time for a CIRP does not include the time taken for an application to be admitted and time periods that are excluded by the order of the AA for reasons assigned by it.  The time excluded by AA in the cases resolved so far was, on average, 116 days. This constitutes about 64 per cent of the time intended in the Code to complete the entire process. The exclusion of time done by the AA helps address compliance with the Code. Still, it does not address the impact on the erosion of business and economic value of the corporate debtor.

The NCLT/Tribunal was made the AA for insolvency and bankruptcy matters, along with their pre-existing adjudicatory role under the Companies Act 2013 and the Competition Law. The government has taken comprehensive measures to strengthen the NCLT. As of September

2024, 30 courts and 16 benches were functioning headed by the President, and 31 each of judicial and technical members. As of the end of July 2024, the NCLT has, quite notably, reported as adjudicated 34,690 cases under the IBC against 35,501 cases numbered, i.e., close to 98 per cent adjudication and disposed of 29,705 cases. However, there are 2,593 cases  awaiting  admission  and  4,723  pending  after  admission. 29   Further  strengthening the number of courts, benches, and members and ramping up physical infrastructure, as envisaged in the Union Budget 2024-25, will help improve the disposal rate. 30

Further, addressing issues in the insolvency procedures and the Tribunal's administrative processes  would  help  to  reduce  pendency  in  the  long  term.  Delays  in  admission  are  of particular concern since, until admission, the company continues to be controlled by the defaulting debtor. While admission is awaited, the opportunities for value shifting, funds diversion and assets transfers increase, leading to further erosion of the value of the CD. 31 While the prescription is admission in 14 days, in FY21, the average time for admission of 153 applications by operational creditors (under section 9 of the Code) was 468. In FY22, an average of 650 days was taken in the admission of 207 applications. 32  Reasons for delay in admission occur as the AA tries to establish the existence of debt and default, as promoters file objections. Including evidentiary proof in the form of contracts, GST filings, etc., is all provided for, but all of this can be contested.

The financial system with digital credit information repositories receipts trading platforms, and  the  Information  Utility  (IU), 33 set  up  under  the  IBC,  is  quite  robust  and  should  be harnessed, and a means for verification of debt and default may be enabled, especially for applications filed by financial creditors. If developed by the market, such a service would address the problem and may also be monetisable as the applicant creditors will benefit from early admission of applications. Providing in the Code for the use of IU records as conclusive proof about the occurrence of a default in general, with necessary exceptions, 34 would enable such services.

Tribunals could improve the time taken for admission with the use of technology and the aid of the court registry for verification, scrutiny, and clearing of defects in the application. The proposed integrated platform for use by various stakeholders can include such features. 35 This  would  eliminate  the  need  for  pre-admission  hearings  and  help  reduce  the  time  to admit an application. In the case of applications filed by operational creditors a voluntary mediation mechanism, if made applicable, may help address default and hence obviate the need for admission.

Another source of delays at the AA during the CIRP is the adjudication of inter-locutory applications. 36  It includes procedural requirements like the appointment of an insolvency

professional, appointment of an authorised representative, consideration of delayed claims, the constitution of the CoC, etc. and frivolous applications. In instances where an objective criterion to determine the achievement of a procedural milestone can be assessed or when decisions are arrived at by consensus among stakeholders, it can be taken on record of the AA. It may not be considered for formal posting before the court. Extending engineering principles,  the  process,  method,  and  output  of  repetitive  procedural  tasks,  which  are amenable for standardisation, should be standardised such as, the use of template-based submissions and orders. In dealing with frivolous applications, the Tribunal needs to be more stringent, and using prevention by way of the imposition of high costs would have the necessary deterrent effect.

Tribunals  have  addressed  the  burden  on  the  traditional  judicial  system  by  enabling specialisation  in  narrower  domains  to  enable  speedy  relief  by  reducing  formalistic procedures and complexity. Tribunals are envisaged to reduce costs and improve efficiency. The same would be possible if the trappings of the traditional judiciary were avoided both in procedure and stakeholders' mindsets.

The IBC provides a non-adversarial resolution process but has not been enabled in practice at the NCLT. The design and execution of procedures in the NCLT may be revisited, keeping the  quasi-judicial  nature  of  the  mandate  as  a  foundational  tenet.  Separate  Rules  for  the NCLT in its role as the AA under the Code may also provide more clarity in dealing with procedural matters and improve the efficiency in its functioning.

## Development in capital markets

2.41  Capital markets are central to India's growth story, catalysing capital formation for the real economy, enhancing the financialisation of domestic savings, and enabling wealth  creation.  As  of  December  2024,  the  Indian  stock  market  has  achieved  new highs, with intermittent corrections, in the midst of geopolitical uncertainties, currency depreciation and domestic market volatility challenges. Investor participation has been a contributor, with number of investors growing from 4.9 crore in FY20 to 13.2 crore as of 31 December 2024. This growth, combined with active listing activity and recent measures  by  the  regulator,  viz.  Securities  and  Exchange  Board  of  India  (SEBI),  to temper excesses, is expected to foster sustainable market expansion.

2.42 The primary markets continued to witness heightened listing activities and investor enthusiasm in FY25, notwithstanding the market volatility and geopolitical uncertainties.  As  per  the  E&amp;Y  Global  IPO  trends 37 ,  Indian  stock  exchanges  provide conducive market conditions for foreign conglomerates to list their local subsidiaries, thereby offering a good opportunity for unlocking value. India's share in global IPO listings surged to 30 per cent in 2024, up from 17 per cent in 2023, making it the leading contributor of primary resource mobilisation globally.

2.43  The total resource mobilisation from primary markets (equity and debt) stands at ₹11.1 lakh crore from April to December 2024, which is 5 per cent more than the

amount mobilised during entire FY24. This also  amounts  to  25.6  per  cent  of  gross fixed capital formation of private and public corporations during FY24. The number of IPOs increased by 32.1 per cent to 259 during April to December 2024 from 196 in the corresponding period of the previous year, while the amount raised almost tripled from ₹53,023 crore to ₹1,53,987 crore in the same period. The mainboard platform witnessed a significant increase in issue size as the average IPO deal size rose to ₹ 2,124 crore, up from ₹814 crore in entire FY24. In the case of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) IPOs, the average deal size increased to ₹39 crore from ₹31 crore during the same period.

2.44  Reflecting the buoyant market conditions, Qualified Institutional Players (QIPs) emerged  as  the  preferred  equity  fundraising  mechanism  for  the  corporates  during FY25, with a 11.4 per cent share in total capital raised. Resource mobilisation through rights  issues  remains  buoyant,  with  ₹16,881  crore  raised  during  April  to  December 2024, compared to ₹6,538 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.

2.45  The domestic corporate debt market continued to gain significant traction during the year. The value of corporate bond issuances stood at ₹7.3 lakh crore from April to December 2024, with an average monthly issuance of ₹ 0.8 lakh crore, higher than the average of ₹0.66 lakh crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Private placements remained the preferred channel for corporates, accounting for 99.1 per  cent  of  total  resources  mobilised  through  the  bond  market.  Increasing  investor demand and elevated costs of borrowing from banks have made these markets more attractive for corporates for funding requirements.

2.46   In  contrast  to  the  equity  market,  the  debt  market  in  India  remains  undercapitalised.  As  a  percentage  of  GDP,  the  corporate  bond  market is only 18 per cent in India, as opposed to 80 per cent in Korea and 36 per cent in China. 38  The market for  corporate  bonds  comprises high-end bonds, with 97 per cent of corporate bond issuances concentrated in the top 3 rating categories (AAA, AA+ and AA). Issuers who are unable to get these ratings are unable to access the bond market. This may explain why most issuers are NBFCs or public sector undertakings (PSUs). 39

2.47  An overwhelming majority of corporate bond issuance happens through the route of private placement, which actively deters the participation of retail investors. In FY24, the public placement of corporate bonds stood at ₹19,000 crore against the private placement of around ₹8,38,000 crore. 40   The financial services sector dominates the issuance of corporate bonds at nearly 60 per cent of the total (International Monetary

Fund (IMF), 2023). Outside financial services, real estate and power generation/ supply comprise  the  rest.  Consequently,  corporate  bond  issuance  from  manufacturing  and non-energy infrastructure sectors is a very small proportion of the overall bond market. From April to December 2024, ₹16,456 crore was raised by Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs).

2.48  If liquidity has to enter corporate bond markets, problems such as entry costs, information asymmetry, and the absence of a secondary market must be addressed. For example, insurance and pension funds cannot be invested in bonds that are lower than AA-rated. This effectively crowds out small players in the corporate bond market. Liquidity is also bottled through regulations that prevent provident funds from investing in corporate bonds for more than 3 years. Moreover, insurance funds are not allowed to invest in debt issued by private companies.

## Secondary Market: Positive performance amidst volatility

2.49  Turning to the performance of the secondary markets, since the commencement of FY25, they have experienced significant volatility driven by various events. These include the general elections in June 2024, the unwinding of carry trades in Japan in August 2024, the escalation of conflict in the Middle East and the U.S. Presidential Election (November 2024). Notwithstanding the intermittent corrections, the markets showed a  consistent  upward trend until September 2024, scaling new all-time highs. Strong domestic economic prospects, robust domestic institutional investor inflows, foreign portfolio investments, anticipated policy pivots from major central banks, etc., drove the uptrend. However, this trend has moderated since October 2024, driven by economic stimulus measures in China, the US Presidential elections and valuation concerns. On account of recent corrections, the benchmark index, Nifty 50, delivered a return (in local currency) of 4.6 per cent return from April to December 2024. The highest returns (in USD) were delivered by Hong Kong's Hang Seng (22.2 per cent), followed by Nasdaq Composite (17.9  per  cent),  Singapore  FTSE  Straits  Times  (16.2  per  cent)  and  South Africa's FTSE/JSE All Share index (13.3 per cent) during the same period.

2.50   However,  on  a  longer-term  basis,  Indian  markets  have  been  among  the  bestperforming markets in the world. The compounded annualised returns of Nifty 50 for the past ten years (since March 2014) stand at 8.8 per cent (adjusted for USD), trailing below few indices, such as the US NASDAQ composite index (15.3 per cent) and US Dow Jones (9.2 per cent) among a select set of significant markets as of December 2024. The corresponding CAGR of China's Shanghai Composite indices stands at 3.2 per cent. The positive performance of the Indian stock was driven by strong profitability growth, rapid traction of digital financial infrastructure, expanding investor base and substantial reforms in products and processes. In line with the performance of Indian

markets, India's weight in the MSCI-EM index reached a new high of 20 per cent in July 2024 before settling down at 19.4 per cent at the end of December 2024. This is only the third highest after China and Taiwan.

2.51   On 23 May 2024, the total market capitalisation of BSE-listed stocks closed above the USD 5 trillion milestone for the first time. At the end of December 2024, BSE's market capitalisation increased by 14.2 per cent since March 2024 to reach ₹445.2 lakh crore. BSE market capitalisation to GDP ratio stood at 136 per cent at the end of December 2024, rising significantly over the last 10 years.

## Rise in investor participation in capital markets

2.52   The  period  since  the  pandemic  has  seen  a  surge  in  individual  and  household participation as capital market investors through direct (trading in markets through their  accounts)  and  indirect  (through  mutual  funds)  channels.  Healthy  corporate earnings,  stable  macro  fundamentals,  efficient  and  robust  technology  architecture facilitating  efficient  trading,  clearing,  and  depository  systems,  and  trust  garnered by mutual fund ecosystem and online digital investment platforms have encouraged greater participation in capital markets.

2.53  The incremental addition to demat accounts has been continuously increasing, with the number of demat accounts rising sharply by 33 per cent to 18.5 crore at the end of December 2024 on a YoY basis. In the equity cash segment, individual investor share turnover 41  was 35.6 per cent from April to December 2024. There are 11.5 crore unique investors with demat accounts and 5.6 crore unique investors in mutual funds as of the end of December 2024. Higher investor participation has engendered a selfreinforcing cycle of strong market returns, bringing in even more investors. This, in

turn, will eventually transform the securities market into a more diverse, inclusive, and robust platform for wealth creation.

2.54   The mutual fund industry has grown well in the last few years and is now crucial in channelling financial savings towards risk capital formation and leveraging technology and innovation. The rise in retail participation through mutual funds is reflected in the doubling of unique investors from 2.9 crore in FY21 to 5.6 crore as of December 2024. The total number of folios (excluding FoF domestic schemes) increased from 17.8 crore at the end of FY24 to 22.5 crore at the end of December 2024, and retail investors 42 held mutual fund units worth ₹18.6 lakh crore. This surge in participation, coupled with strong market performance, has led to a remarkable increase in mutual funds' assets under management (AuM), which rose to ₹66.9 lakh crore as of December 2024, registering 25.3 per cent growth from March 2024.

2.55   The mutual fund segment presently has more than 10 crore Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) accounts, with cumulative SIP inflows of ₹10.9 lakh crore since inception. Monthly average gross SIP flows have more than doubled in the last three years, from ₹0.10 lakh crore in FY22 to ₹0.23 lakh crore in FY25. Aided by these sustained inflows, mutual fund ownership in Indian listed companies has risen to a fresh all-time high of 9.5 per cent 43  in the quarter ending September 2024, from 8.7 per cent in FY24.

2.56  Amid the impressive performance of the Indian stock markets, several factors could potentially pose significant risks. Box II.2 discusses these factors in detail.

## Box II.2: Risks for the Indian stock market in 2025

As we move into 2025, the US financial landscape is characterised by high stock market valuations, record corporate profits and extremely optimistic investor sentiment. With the US comprising 75 per cent of the MSCI World Index (as of November 2024), any correction in  its  market  could  have  profound  ripple  effects  on  global  markets,  including  India, underscoring the need for heightened vigilance.

## US markets at a record high

Notwithstanding accentuated geopolitical tensions, the US equity markets had a solid run for the second year in a row, outperforming the broader developed market pack. Following a 24 per cent gain in 2023, the S&amp;P 500 Index is well on course to generate a 20 per cent+ return  in  2024.  This  outperformance  came  on  the  back  of  economic  resilience,  robust corporate earnings that have surged to record-high levels (~USD 4 trillion as of the quarter ending September 2024), 44   strengthening rate cut expectations early in the year and an all-time high investor confidence. That said, the surge in US stock market valuations to an unattractive zone, currently at their third highest levels as indicated by Shiller's S&amp;P 500 CAPE ratio (Cyclically Adjusted Price-Earnings Ratio), warrants some caution. Further, the rally over the last two years has been largely driven by a few mega-capitalisation technology companies-Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia. This is reflected in a strong 40 per cent+ year-to-date return in the S&amp;P 500 Top 10 Index.

The performance of the S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Index, which assigns equal weight to all 500 constituents, effectively diluting the impact of the largest companies, is also a good assessment of  the  performance of the S&amp;P 500 excluding these companies. The S&amp;P 500 Index has rallied by a total of 56 per cent in 2023 and 2024, more than double that generated by the equal weight index. This, along with tapering rate cut expectations, with the US Federal Reserve's dot plot now suggesting a 50bps cut in 2025, down from the earlier guidance of 100bps, has added to the potential risks and uncertainties.

Interestingly,  investor  sentiments  this  time  have  been  heavily  influenced  by  sustained demand for high-growth stocks and extreme and unreasonable optimism, as indicated by an all-time high divergence between the share of respondents expecting an increase in stock prices and income levels (based on the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey). However, history shows sentiment-driven rallies are often fragile, with confidence shifting rapidly in response to external shocks, such as geopolitical events, policy changes, or economic slowdowns. This makes the current environment particularly susceptible to volatility, with any unexpected developments potentially triggering significant market corrections.

At the same time, questions are emerging about the sustainability of U.S. corporate earnings, particularly as they are concentrated within a few major technology firms and supported by strong government spending, up 10 per cent YoY to USD 6.75 trillion 45   from October 2023 to September 2024.

Furthermore,  investor  demand  for  structured  and  complex  products,  where  returns  are backed  by  revenues  from  unconventional  assets  such  as  data  centres,  music  catalogues and solar panels revenues, has surged to the highest level since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). 46

## Retail participation in India at record high

Indian equity markets have also had a steady run since the onset of the pandemic, driven by factors that extend beyond global influences. One such notable factor has been a surge in retail participation over the last five years, both in terms of investor numbers and trading activity.  The  unique  investor  base  at  the  National  Stock  Exchange  (NSE)  surpassed  the 10-crore mark in August 2024, tripling in the last four years, and currently stands at 10.9

crore (as of 26 December 2024). The number of client codes, indicating a number of investor accounts at NSE, has risen from a little under six crore at the end of 2019 to nearly 21 crore as of December 2024.

Regarding activity, the number of individuals that traded at least once a month in the NSE's cash market segment increased from ~32 lakh in January 2020 to ~1.4 crore in November 2024. The rise in individuals' participation in Indian equity markets is also reflected in the amount of money invested by them. After remaining on the sidelines for the previous 11 years, individuals turned net buyers of Indian equities in 2020, only to strengthen it further over the ensuing years. In the last five years (2020-24), individuals have invested a net amount of ₹4.4 lakh crore in the NSE's cash market segment, with net inflows in 2024 (Jan-Nov'24) surging to a record high of ₹1.5 lakh crore. This, along with strong indirect participation via mutual funds, has more than made up for volatile FPI outflows over the last five years. Notably, direct and indirect (via mutual funds) ownership of individual investors at 17.6 per cent (as of September 2024) in the NSE-listed companies is now at par with FPIs. This gap was as high as 7.1 percentage points in FY21.

Data for 2024

Till Date is for the period January-November24

Deepening individual participation, coupled with robust gains generated by Indian equities, outpacing other asset classes, has created significant household wealth over the last few years.

As per the NSE's estimates, household wealth in Indian equities has increased by over ₹40 lakh crore in the last five years (2020-2024; as of September 2024).

This rise in retail participation aligns with a steady decline in the 5-year rolling beta between the Nifty 50 and the S&amp;P 500 in the last four years, suggesting a reduced sensitivity of Indian markets to U.S. market movements. This decoupling is further evidenced by the increasing resilience of Indian markets during periods of FPI outflows. For example, in October 2024, despite FPI outflows of USD 11 billion, the Nifty 50 index was corrected by only 6.2 per cent, thanks to strong downside support provided by domestic institutional and individual investors. In contrast, during the March 2020 pandemic-driven market sell-off, FPI outflows of USD 8 billion triggered a steep 23 per cent market decline.

Even  as  the  resilience  demonstrated  by  the  Indian  market,  supported  by  growing  retail participation,  is  promising,  the  risks  associated  with  a  potential  US  market  correction cannot be overlooked, given historical trends.

## What does the history tell us?

Historical data and research suggest that the Indian equity market has been notably sensitive to movements in the US market. The Nifty 50 has historically shown a strong correlation with the S&amp;P 500, with analysis of daily index returns between 2000 to 2024 revealing that in 22 instances when the S&amp;P 500 corrected by more than 10 per cent, the Nifty 50 posted a negative return in all but one case, averaging a 10.7 per cent decline. On the other hand, during 51 instances when the Nifty 50 experienced a correction of over 10 per cent, the S&amp;P 500 exhibited positive returns in 13 instances, with an average return of -5.5 per cent.

This underscores the asymmetric relationship between the two markets, highlighting a more pronounced impact of the movement in US markets on Indian equities than the other way around.

Further evidence shows that S&amp;P 500 returns Granger-cause 48  Nifty 50 returns, meaning that  changes  in  the  US  market  are  a  leading  indicator  for  the  Indian  market,  especially during shocks, while the reverse is not true. This emphasises that Indian markets tend to react more to trends originating in the US, reinforcing the need for caution in the event of a downturn in the latter's stock market.

## Potential risks for India in 2025

Elevated  valuations  and  optimistic  market  sentiments  in  the  US  raise  the  likelihood  of a meaningful market correction in 2025. Should such a correction occur, it could have a cascading effect on India, especially given the increased participation of young, relatively new retail investors. Many of these investors that have entered the market post-pandemic have never witnessed a significant and prolonged market correction. Hence, if one were to occur, its impact on sentiment and spending may be non-trivial.

## GIFT City

2.57  The International Financial Services Centres Authority (IFSCA) is poised to play a pivotal role in India's vision for 2047. As a unified regulator, IFSCA is responsible for developing and regulating financial institutions, services, and products within India's International  Financial  Services  Centres  (IFSCs).  With  its  internationally  aligned regulatory regime, IFSCA aims to create an environment conducive to global financial institutions operating in India. This, in turn, will facilitate the growth of India's financial sector, making it a key player in the global economy.

2.58  GIFT IFSC has been witnessing brisk growth, having more than 720 entities across categories. The international and domestic financial services industry is gravitating to this unique jurisdiction which benefits from unrestricted currency convertibility as it is classified as a non-resident zone under the Foreign Exchange Management Regulations. GIFT-IFSC has continued its ascent as a leading IFSC, improving its rank by five places in the 'Global Financial Centres Index 36' (GFCI 36), rising to 52nd position.

## Developments in the insurance sector

2.62   The  global  insurance  market  is  experiencing  a  dynamic  period  of  growth  and transformation,  driven  by  steady  economic  expansion,  strong  labour  markets,  and rising  real  incomes.  Despite  considerable  challenges  in  2023,  including  persistently high inflation and geopolitical tensions that constrained the global GDP growth, the insurance sector demonstrated a positive growth rate of 2.8 per cent. 49  The changing macroeconomic environment, climate fluctuations, technological progress, and evolving customer  preferences  drive  transformation  in  technology,  infrastructure,  business models,  and  organisational  culture  within  the  insurance  industry.  Global  insurers are  actively  adopting  innovative  technologies,  expanding  their  market  reach,  and prioritising customer-centric approaches to improve efficiency and address emerging demands. 50

2.63  India's  insurance  market  has  also  continued  its  upward  trajectory.  Total insurance premium grew by 7.7 per cent in FY24, reaching ₹11.2 lakh crore, despite a slight decline in insurance penetration 51   from 4 per cent in FY23 to 3.7 per cent in FY24. Life insurance penetration dropped marginally from 3 per cent in FY23 to 2.8 per cent in FY24, while non-life insurance penetration remained stable at 1 per cent.

49  Swiss Re Institute World Insurance Report 2024, https://tinyurl.com/bdfc3ma8.

50    EY  August 2024 report, 'Insurance for All: enhancing insurance coverage across India', https://tinyurl.com/ ucapam6y.

51    Insurance penetration is calculated as the percentage of insurance premiums paid in a year to the country's gross domestic product.

Insurance density 52   in the country saw a modest rise from USD 92 in FY23 to USD 95 in FY24. Non-life insurance density increased from USD 22 to USD 25, while life insurance density remained consistent at USD 70. This growth in insurance density has been on an upward trajectory since FY17. The gross direct premium of non-life insurers increased to ₹2.9 lakh crore in FY24 from ₹2.6 lakh crore in FY23, registering a YoY growth of 7.7 per cent. Health and motor segments primarily contributed to this growth. The life insurance industry recorded a premium income of ₹8.3 lakh crore in FY24, compared to ₹7.8 lakh crore in FY23, registering a YoY growth of 6.1 per cent. While renewal premiums accounted for 54.4 per cent of the total premium received by the life insurers, new businesses contributed the remaining 45.6 per cent. The life insurance industry paid benefits of ₹5.8 lakh crore in FY24, out of which ₹42,284 crore was due to death claims. The net incurred claims 53 of non-life insurers stood at ₹1.72 lakh crore in FY24.

2.64  With an overall insurance penetration rate of 3.7 per cent, below the global average of 7 per cent, there is a notable gap in coverage that presents opportunities for insurers to expand their reach. By targeting tier 2 and 3 cities and rural areas where awareness and accessibility are limited, insurers can tap into new customer segments and stimulate growth. Additionally, insurance density in India is relatively low compared to global standards. Innovative distribution models can facilitate the inclusion of underinsured customers who are already covered by government schemes such as the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, and Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana. 54

2.65  The Swiss Re Institute has projected India's insurance sector to grow at a rate of 11.1 per cent and is expected to become the fastest-growing market among the G20 nations over the next five years (2024-2028). An expanding middle class, technological advancements, and supportive regulatory measures will likely drive this growth. 55  In the life insurance segment, there is a noticeable shift towards protection and guaranteed return savings products, which now cover 40 per cent of households, largely due to LIC's extensive network. The non-life insurance sector is expected to double its premium-toGDP ratio over the next two decades. However, it will remain below the global average. 56

52    Insurance  density  is  calculated  as  the  ratio  of  insurance  premium  to  population  (calculated  in  USD  for international comparison).

53    Net claims incurred is the total outstanding claims at the end of a financial year. It is calculated by adding the claims paid during the year to the outstanding claims at the end of the year and then subtracting the outstanding claims at the beginning of the year.

2.66   Evolving  customer  expectations  and  emerging  risks,  such  as  climate  change and geopolitical uncertainty, present significant challenges for insurers. Additionally, increasing life expectancy and a growing elderly population pose underwriting risks related to longevity and highlight the widening pension gap. Non-financial risks have gained importance alongside traditional financial risks. The industry must address and manage concerns related to misselling, delayed claims settlements, AI, cybersecurity, and third-party interactions. A clear and quantitative understanding of risk appetite is  essential for effective risk management. Insurers must develop strong capabilities to tackle these emerging risks through rapid innovation while ensuring efficiency and productivity through simplification, standardisation, and digitisation.  57

## Developments in the pension sector

2.67  Ensuring financial security in retirement is essential for individuals and societies, especially as many countries face ageing populations' social, economic, and financial challenges. The World Economic Forum (WEF) has highlighted that, for the first time in history, globally, the number of people aged 65 and over has surpassed the number of children aged five and younger. 58 Retirees face increasing risks due to rising inflation and higher interest rates, which elevate the cost of government debt and strain the government's ability to maintain their current level of services. 59

2.68  An IMF staff discussion paper 60 has analysed the global trends in rising government pension expenditure, projecting that public pension spending will increase by an average of  1  per  cent  of  GDP  in  AEs  and  2.5  per  cent  in  EMEs  by  2050. In many advanced economies, younger individuals must save significantly more and delay retirement by several years to receive pension benefits comparable to today's retirees. Additionally, countries with ageing and shrinking working-age populations are expected to experience a more pronounced decrease in national savings than those with younger populations.

2.69   According  to  the  Mercer  CFA  Institute  Global  Pension  Index 61 ,  2024,  India's overall index value has moderated from 45.9 in 2023 to 44 in 2024. The overall index is a weighted average of three sub-indices viz. adequacy (40 per cent), sustainability (35

per cent), and integrity (25 per cent). A decline in the value of the adequacy 62  sub-index from 41.9 (as per the 2023 survey report) to 34.2 (as per the 2024 survey report) and a decrease in the net pension replacement rates has driven the moderation in the overall index. On the other hand, the scores for sustainability 63 and integrity 64  sub-indices have improved across the two survey rounds.

2.70   India's  pension  sector  has  grown  significantly  since  the  introduction  of  the National  Pension  System  (NPS)  and  Atal  Pension  Yojana  (APY).  As  of  September 2024, the total number of subscribers reached 783.4 lakh, showing a YoY growth of 16 per cent from 675.2 lakh in September 2023. The number of APY subscribers, which includes its earlier version, NPS Lite, rose from 538.2 lakh in March 2023 to 629.1 lakh in September 2024. APY subscribers comprise approximately 80.3 per cent of the overall pension subscriber base. 65

2.71    Disaggregated  data  from  the  Pension  Fund  Regulatory  and  Development Authority of India (PFRDA) indicates significant improvements in terms of gender in the subscriber demographic for APY. The share of female subscribers increased from 37.9 per cent in FY16 to 52 per cent in FY24. Additionally, the age distribution has shifted to favour a younger cohort, specifically those aged 18-25, whose share rose from 29.2 per cent in FY16 to 45.5 per cent in FY24. However, 93.7 per cent of APY accounts correspond to a pension amount of ₹1,000 per month, while 3.7 per cent are for ₹5,000. This overwhelming preference for a low pension amount among APY subscribers can be attributed to several factors, the most significant being that the target population primarily  consists  of  low-income  households,  where  daily  consumption  needs  take precedence  over  savings.  Furthermore,  the  overall  pension  coverage  for  these  two schemes has increased from 0.95 per cent of the total population in FY16 to 5.3 per cent in FY24. Additionally, the AuM for these schemes as a proportion of GDP have risen from 0.86 per cent in FY16 to 4 per cent in FY24.

2.72  On 24 August 2024, the government approved Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for Government employees that will be implemented along with the present NPS, and will be effective from FY26. UPS has features of both old and new pension schemes to offer a wholesome retirement cushion to the employees. The scheme offers a family pension,

62    The adequacy sub-index represents both the benefits of the current pension systems and an assessment of some important system design features. It is calculated based on these indicators: benefits, system design, savings, Government support, home ownership, and growth assets.

63    The Sustainability sub-index focuses on the future and uses various indicators that will influence the likelihood that the existing systems will be able to provide benefits for decades to come. It is calculated based on these indicators: pension coverage, total assets, demography, public expenditure, government debt, and economic growth.

64    Integrity sub-index includes many legislative requirements that influence the overall governance and operations of the system, which affect the level of confidence that the citizens of each country have in their system. It is calculated based on these indicators: regulation, governance, protection, communication, and operating costs.

a  guaranteed  pension  amount,  and  a  minimum  pension  for  all  the  people  working in government jobs. It guarantees 50 per cent of the average basic pay of the past 12 months preceding the date of retirement as the guaranteed pension for the employee, provided the employee has served the government for at least 25 years. The minimum pension under the scheme is ₹ 10,000 per month for employees who have at least 10 years in the service upon superannuation. In case of death of the pensioner, 60 per cent of the pension amount (which he or she received right before the demise), will be offered to the family. 66

2.73  Despite this growth, India's pension system has considerable potential for further expansion.  Pension  assets,  including  major  schemes  like  the  Employees'  Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), account for 17 per cent of the GDP. The NPS contributes an additional 4.5 per cent of the GDP. In contrast, the average pension assets in OECD countries exceed 80 per cent of their GDP. 67  India's capacity to financially empower its citizens is anticipated to grow as the economy progresses. Additionally, the extension of  NPS  to  children  through  the  NPS  Vatsalya 68 is  expected  to  contribute  to  this empowerment. Box II.3 discusses further aspects of the pension landscape in the country.

## Box II.3: Securing Retirement: Transforming India's Pension Landscape

By design, the benefits of a robust pension system are realised long into the future. The system's liabilities (pension payments) become due far later, while there is always a risk that  the  assets  (contributions  from  a  younger  workforce)  may  change  in  the  meantime. A  potential  asset-liability  mismatch  can  result  in  explosive  government  debt  once  the future payouts become due. For instance, Greece and Italy suffered pension crises as their populations aged. The UK is predicted to hit a pensions crisis in the next two decades. 69

## What constitutes an efficient pension system in the case of India?

Considering  India's  unique  demographic  and  labour  market  characteristics,  the  pension system must embrace principles of sustainability and scalability. Emphasising sustainability is  crucial  to  ensure that as India moves beyond its favourable demographic window, the burden of an ageing population does not disproportionately affect the younger generation. For  a  pension  scheme  to  be  sustainable,  the  outflows  must  be  adequately  linked  to  the inflows. In this context, Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) schemes 70   begin to fail when demographic profiles change. Furthermore, the nature of inflation indexation is important, especially in defined benefit schemes. Even small differences in percentage points for indexation can lead to significant variations in the annuities paid out.

70    PAYGO schemes are essentially pay-as-you-go arrangements where the young salaried employees bear the price of pension payments for the older generation. Several OECD nations usually follow this.

Despite significant advancements in the pension sector, 5.3 per cent of the total population is covered by the NPS and APY combined. This highlights another critical aspect of the Indian pension  system:  scalability.  Low  costs  are  essential  to  enhance  coverage  meaningfully. Achieving  this  will  require  highly  competitive,  low-cost  fund  management  and  minimal transaction costs, which is particularly vital for small-ticket transactions.

In  principle,  taking  into  consideration  both  scalability  and  sustainability,  India's  pension system design seems robust and stable. The NPS is one of the lowest-cost pension schemes globally 71   and its framework is based on a defined contribution model, which ensures that future payouts are determined by market fluctuations, thereby reducing the fiscal burden on the government. Additionally, the APY aims to address the retirement needs of the unorganised and informal sectors - first time in India's pension history. While progress under APY has been notable, its scalability in practice remains an area for further development.  The key issue moving forward is how to make the pension system more accessible to the informal sector.

Role  of  financial  inclusion  in  advancing  financial  literacy: The  example  of  the Unified Payment Interface (UPI) illustrates how a well-designed platform can serve as a cost-effective solution for financial inclusion on a large scale. The widespread adoption of UPI proves that a lack of financial literacy did not hinder its success; rather, the necessity to  utilise  UPI  encouraged  the  informal  economy  to  open  bank  accounts.  This  suggests that financial inclusion can indeed precede financial literacy. Thus, a fundamental step in integrating a significant portion of the informal sector into the pension framework is raising awareness  about  pension  and  financial  literacy  and  utilising  modern,  application-based interfaces that allow seamless access to these services.

Behavioural nudges for scalability: A persistent issue with micro-pension schemes is  their  low  uptake  among  the  poor,  who  often  have  a  strong  urge  to  allocate  limited funds toward immediate consumption. 72   In this context, increasing participation can be achieved  through  behavioural  interventions.  These  interventions  could  involve  changing how information is presented, simplifying the enrolment process (for example, using UPIenabled pension payments), and providing timely reminders.

Young people in India may not feel an immediate need to secure an optimal pension plan. The old-age dependency ratio is about 15.7 per cent, which is significantly lower than in many EMEs. However, this should not lead to complacency. The best time to repair a roof is when the sun is shining, not when it is raining.

## Financial sector regulators

2.74 Independent regulators are key institutions established as separate 'agencies' at arms' length from the political system, with delegated powers to implement specific policies in several sectors. Regulators have been set up in the utility sector (energy, telecom,  airports),  competition,  social  sector  (higher  education),  financial  services (capital  markets, insurance, pensions) etc. These regulatory agencies are seen to be

71  Department of Financial Services 2024, https://tinyurl.com/32efw7wf.

72  World Bank 2019, https://tinyurl.com/53uy6655.

mainly  designed  to  have  the  authority  to  deal  with  intricate  issues,  providing  nondiscriminatory  access  to  essential  services  and  guaranteeing  'fair  and  transparent' regulations.  The  key  benefit  sought  from  an  institutional  framework  based  around these independent regulators/agencies is to safeguard market interventions from the interference of political and private interests. Further, these independent regulatory bodies (IRBs) can set up and benefit from a specialised workforce with relevant technical knowledge of the area of regulation.

2.75 The financial sector is primarily governed through IRBs - RBI, SEBI, IRDAI, PFRDA and IBBI, with FSDC having a broader financial stability mandate, enabling inter-regulatory coordination and promoting financial sector development. 73  Each IRB varies in design, the nature of delegated functions, and the degree of autonomy, which are  unique  to  the  socio-political  context  of  its  evolution  and  the  regulated  domain. However, certain basic structure elements are common to all regulatory bodies: they are backed by a statute, are accountable to the legislature, enjoy a certain degree of autonomy from the government, have legislative, executive and quasi-judicial functions, and engage in specialised and technocratic decision-making processes.

2.76 Regulations are the basic instruments of law through which the IRBs conduct their functions and deliver on their objectiveness. The efficiency and effectiveness of regulatory  action  are  directly  dependent  on  the  quality  of  regulations.  The  primary responsibility  of  these  IRBs  is  the  making  of  regulations,  the  power  for  which  is delegated to the IRBs by statute and is an essential component of the autonomy of IRBs. Box II.4 discusses the regulation-making aspect of the IRBs in the financial sector space, suggesting the approach of regulatory impact assessment for strengthening this process.

## Box II.4: Institutionalising regulatory impact assessments in independent regulatory bodies

The regulators in the financial sector space are largely left to regulate themselves in their mandate of  ensuring  optimal  and  adequate  regulation  and  assessing  themselves.  In  the existing governance architecture, the performance of IRBs in the financial sector is assessed in the following ways.

Parliament, through the Committee on Sub-ordinate Legislations 74  in the Rajya Sabha:  It is mandated to examine if the powers delegated under a law passed by the legislature have been duly exercised and are within the conferment or delegation and not beyond.

73    Department of Economic Affairs, Government of India. Structure of Financial Stability and Development Council, https://tinyurl.com/nhbd23t3.

74  Rajya Sabha Practice and Procedure Series No. 13, Committee on Subordinate Legislations No.13 pp 3-4. https:// tinyurl.com/4vtvwxbh.

Parliament, through the Standing Committee on Finance, can examine the performance of specific sectors and the IRBs. The Committee, in 2024, examined the performance of the insurance sector (66th Report).

Department  /  Ministry  administering  the  parent  statute-  These  assessments  deal  with overall  performance,  utilisation/expenditure  of  grants,  compliance  with  parliamentary procedure and administrative matters regarding the structure and composition of the IRBs. The quality of regulation usually falls beyond the ambit of regular evaluations.

The  Comptroller  and  Auditor  General's  (CAG)  mandate  includes  the  various  audits  of autonomous entities, including IRBs. However, the scope of CAG's financial compliance and financial audits do not include the IRB's regulation-making processes. The quality of regulation is beyond the scope of these audits.

Judicial  review  -  Once  a  regulation  is  challenged,  the  courts  then  review,  ex-post, the  implementation  of  the  regulations.  Such  reviews  may  cover  the  form,  content  or implementation of the regulation. Withstanding judicial scrutiny improves the regulation's force and vindicates the regulation maker's decisions. However, the gains from such review are only available after implementation and not during the making of regulations.

The  quality  of  regulations  can  be  broadly  assessed  based  on  five  criteria:  democratic legitimacy, accountability of the regulator, fair, accessible and open procedures, expertise and efficiency. 75 While these criteria are impacted by many structural and operational factors in the regulator and beyond, using a 'fair, accessible and open procedure' for regulationmaking is more practicable than the others. A systematic procedure for regulation-making is one way to ensure that the quality of regulations is right.

Regulatory  impact  assessment  (RIA)  has  been  identified  as  an  effective  tool  when  used as  part  of  the  regulation-making  process  to  ensure  the  quality  of  regulations.  RIA  is  an administrative  obligation  or  an  instrument  of  public  policy  analysis  for  identifying  the costs of regulation on certain business sectors (Fischer, Miller and Sidney 2007)  76  and has been promoted by the World Bank (2010). 77  OECD laid down the guidelines for the use of RIAs in 2008. 78  By 2016, 32 of the 35 OECD countries had included RIA in their regulatory frameworks  (Deighton-Smith,  Erbacci  and  Kauffmann  2016). 79   Globally,  countries  are increasingly adopting and revamping RIA procedures, including countries across all income levels. 80

Financial  sector  IRBs  have  been  including  the  elements/aspects  of  RIA  and  related regulatory best practices. The RBI has set a Medium-term Strategy Framework - Utkarsh 2022, and the SEBI indicates regulatory plans as part of its annual reports. 81   The IBBI governs the regulation-making process through the IBBI (Mechanism  for Issuing Regulations) Regulations, 2018.  82  It provides for at least 21 days for public consultations while  proposing/amending  regulations,  consultations  with  stakeholders  and  advisory committees, and an economic analysis covering the expected costs and benefits to society, economy, stakeholders, and itself on account of the proposed regulation. It also provides for a review of all regulations every three years.  It is observed that most regulators practice consultations  with  stakeholders  during  regulation-making  through  discussion  papers shared on their websites. A third-party evaluation of the regulatory performance of the IBBI was conducted in 2021 (NCAER, 2021). 83

There is vast scope for improvement in the regulatory responsiveness in terms of following participatory processes of the IRBs. 84   The  second  Administrative Reforms Commission 85 recommended including reviews of regulations. The Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission 86   detailed the process for making regulations as part of the draft financial code. The proposed process included a detailed cost-benefit analysis of the proposed regulations alongside the considered alternatives. The Union Budget 2023-24 87  recommended that the financial  sector  regulators  include  public  consultations  as  part  of  the  regulation-making process,  issuing  subsidiary  directions,  conducting  a  comprehensive  review  of  existing regulations and laying down time limits for various applications under different regulations.

As financial sector regulators take steps to address the review of regulations and shortcomings in  the  regulation-making  process,  it  would  be  an  opportune  time  to  institutionalise a systematic approach such as the RIA. There is vast evidence of the benefits of RIAs in terms of better quality of regulations and reduced compliance burden, thereby reducing the cost of compliance for businesses. RIA is also effective in improving the transparency and responsiveness of the IRBs, thereby improving credibility.

One credible approach to RIA would be to set up an independent agency housed inside the  regulator  to  evaluate  the  regulations  from  all  angles.  This  agency  will  report  to  the Board and not to the management. It can provide an impartial and objective assessment of  the  regulatory  processes  and  outcomes, including the economic and social impacts of regulations. An economic and social cost-benefit analysis of regulations will prove useful to

regulators in making them effective and purposeful rather than broad-based, cumbersome, and inhibiting legitimate economic activity and risk-taking. Such a move will signal that regulators are willing to live by the principles they expect regulatory entities to follow. This will strengthen the credibility of the process regulators follow and improve the acceptance of the proposed measures.

Regulation in the financial sector must strike an optimal balance between the imperative of  stability  and  the  goals  of  fostering  innovation,  efficiency,  and  competition.  Given  the country's  low  financial  literacy  and  lower-middle-income  status,  ensuring  stability  is essential to prevent systemic risks and protect consumers. However, this should not come at the expense of stifling creativity, innovation, or healthy market dynamics. At the same time, an excessive focus on innovation and competition without adequate safeguards can lead to financial instability, resource misallocation, and erosion of trust in the system. Striking this balance is particularly critical for India, considering its vast and diverse economy, growing aspirations,  and  substantial  investment  needs  to  sustain  high  growth  and  development. Regulators must consistently strive to achieve this equilibrium, and the suggestions outlined in this box, if implemented, will help them pursue and maintain that balance effectively.

## Cybersecurity aspects of India's financial sector

2.77  Cyberspace has emerged as a multifaceted and rapidly evolving global environment where  interactions  among  individuals,  software,  and  services  are  facilitated  by  the widespread proliferation of information and communication technology (ICT) devices and  networks.  With  innovative  technologies  and  advanced  digital  tools,  cyberspace has  effectively  transcended  geographical  barriers  for  exchanging  information  and communication.  However,  this  digital  revolution  has  concurrently  introduced  new challenges and threats, including the illicit use of cyberspace for criminal activities.

2.78   With  technological  advancements,  the  Indian  financial  sector  is  witnessing  a digital  transformation  that  has  enhanced  efficiency  and  accessibility  and  increased exposure to diverse cyber threats. These threats, ranging from phishing and ransomware to Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, SMSing, and fake/malicious mobile applications,  pose  serious  challenges  to  the  financial  system's  stability.
