India's  labour  market indicators have experienced substantial improvements in  recent  years  driven  by  a  robust  post-pandemic  recovery  and  increased formalisation. According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey, the unemployment rate  has  significantly  declined  over  time,  alongside  positive  trends  in  labour force participation and the worker population ratio. Factory employment data further reflects the manufacturing sector's resilience.

To fully capitalise on the demographic dividend, it is well-recognised that creating quality jobs that offer sustainable livelihoods is crucial. Further, by prioritising reskilling, upskilling, and new-skilling, the government is aiming to align the workforce  with  global  demands,  enhancing  both  domestic  and  international employability.  Simplifying  compliances,  promoting  labour  flexibility,  and strengthening  workers'  welfare  are  vital  for  driving  sustainable  job  growth. Lowering  the  fixed  costs  of  doing  business  through  deregulation  will  create room for enterprises to hire more. To boost women's workforce participation, prioritising targeted skill development and providing entrepreneurial support is being pursued. Additionally, sectors like the digital economy and renewable energy offer vast potential for creating high-quality jobs, which is essential for achieving the Viksit Bharat's vision.
