## Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban

6.31 Building on the success of the Open Defecation Free (ODF) nation through the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM-U), SBM-Urban 2.0 was launched in 2021. It envisions

creating 'garbage-free cities', integrating waste management and sanitation practices aligned with sustainability and circular economy principles. Progress and cumulative achievements under the SBM-U are given below:

6.32  The impact of the SBM-U was well-recognised. As per the 78th round report of NSS 15 ,  97  per cent of households in urban areas report access to toilets. Niti Aayog Sector Report (2021) 16 reported that SBM-U was well aligned with sustainable development goals and national priorities and was effectively implemented. Further, to encourage cities  to  improve  urban  sanitation,  the  government  developed  the  ODF,  ODF+,

ODF ++ and Water+ protocols to evaluate urban local bodies (ULBs) on standardised parameters of sustainable sanitation.  Progress as of December 2024 is given below:

6.33   Besides,  leveraging  ICT-enabled  tools  strengthened  the  mission  governance. The Swachhata App effectively allows citizens to report grievances, directing them to the relevant municipal corporation for resolution. With 2.08 crore users, the app has handled 2.55 crore complaints, resolving 2.39 crore. The Google toilet locator allows users to upload information about community and public toilets in their cities as 'SBM Toilet' on Google Maps and provide feedback. To date, 67,407 toilets across 3,326 cities are mapped on Google Maps, including those in hospitals, malls, bus stands, railway stations, metro stations, markets, and more.

6.34 Urban  housing: The  Pradhan  Mantri  Awas  Yojana  -  Urban  (PMAY-U), launched in 2015, aims to provide permanent housing in urban areas. As of November 25, 2024, a total of 1.18 crore houses have been sanctioned, with 1.14 crore grounded and over 89 lakh completed. PMAY-U 2.0 was launched in September 2024 to assist an additional one crore households. Currently, 29 states and union territories have signed agreements to implement PMAY-U 2.0, with approval having been granted for 6 lakh houses in FY25.

6.35 Urban transport: Metro rail and rapid rail transit systems are operational or under construction in 29 cities across India, with 1010 kilometres currently operational in 23 cities and an additional 980 kilometres underway. As of January 5, 2025, 62.7 kms were operationalised in FY25, and the daily ridership reached 10.2 million. These systems have led to considerable savings in emissions, time, vehicle operating costs, accidents and infrastructure maintenance.

## 6.36 Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT):

AMRUT scheme was launched in 2015 to focus on improving urban water management in 500 cities. As a result, tap water coverage has increased to 70 per cent, and sewerage coverage has risen to 62 per cent. The mission has created or augmented water treatment capacity of 4,649 million litres per day and developed 2,439 parks, adding 5,070 acres of green space. In 2021, AMRUT 2.0 was introduced to expand coverage to all statutory towns and cities, with an allocation of ₹2.77 lakh crore during FY22 to FY26. This phase so far has initiated 8,923 projects worth ₹1.89 lakh crore. AMRUT 2.0 actively involves self-help groups and promotes innovative technologies.

6.37 Smart Cities Mission: Launched in 2015, the mission aims to develop smart cities with essential infrastructure, good quality of life and a sustainable environment. As of 13 January 2025, 8,058 projects worth 1.64 lakh crore have been proposed, with 7,479 projects worth 1.50 lakh crore completed (Chart VI.20). Achievements under the mission are provided in Chart V1.21.

6.38 Central to urban transformation is leveraging technology and data to improve the efficiency and quality of urban services, including transportation, energy, healthcare, and education. Along these lines, the government has taken various initiatives, which are detailed in Box VI.13.

## Box VI.13: Initiatives driving urban transformation

Several  initiatives  are  being  implemented  to  foster  sustainable  urban  development  and governance.  These  efforts  focus  on  enhancing  climate  resilience,  promoting  data-driven decision-making,  and  improving  infrastructure  and  citizen  services  across  cities.  These initiatives include:

- Climate Smart Cities Assessment Framework (CSCAF): Launched in 2019, this public assessment framework aims to enhance climate-sensitive development in cities. CSCAF 2.0 was introduced in 2020, evaluating 126 cities via 28 indicators across five thematic areas. The upcoming CSCAF 3.0 is currently being developed.
- DataSmart cities strategy: promotes data-driven governance with the data maturity assessment framework to assess cities'  readiness  to  adopt  data  solutions,  focusing  on systemic and sectoral pillars.
- National urban innovation stack: facilitates collaboration within urban ecosystems by leveraging urban data, supporting data-driven governance.
- National  urban  learning  platform: A  scalable  platform  designed  for  capacity building among urban local bodies, offering a comprehensive approach to improve urban management capabilities.
- City  investments  to  innovate,  integrate  and  sustain  challenge: supports innovative urban projects with significant funding, promoting circular economy practices. The  second  phase  was  approved  in  2023  to  fund  climate-resilient  infrastructure  in  a maximum of 18 cities.
- Urban learning internship programme: Launched in 2020, TULIP connects urban local bodies with youth, offering internship opportunities to enhance skills and experience in  urban  transformation. As of now, more than 49,000 internship opportunities have been posted across the nation, out of which over 14,500 internships are ongoing and completed.
- National  Urban  Digital  Mission: seeks  to  establish  shared  digital  infrastructure across cities, enhancing citizen-centric governance and service delivery by 2024.

6.39 Real  Estate  Development: Rules  under  the  Real  Estate  (Regulation  &amp; Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) have been notified in all States and Union Territories except Nagaland, with various regulatory authorities established. About 1.38 lakh real estate projects and 95,987 real estate agents have been registered under the Real Estate Regulatory Authority as of January 6, 2025. 1.38 lakh complaints have been disposed of by the RERA across the country.
