# Services Sector Performance in India

## SERVICES SECTOR PERFORMANCE IN INDIA

8.4 India's services sector has been the steadiest contributor to the gross value added (GVA) in the economy. Its contribution to the total GVA at current prices has increased from 50.6 per cent in FY14 to about 55 per cent in FY25. It also provides employment to approximately 30 per cent of the workforce.

## Purchasing manager's index (PMI)- services

8.8 HSBC's  India  services  PMI  shows  that  the  service  sector  remained  in  the expansionary zone for continuous 41 months since August 2021. The index remained above the 60 mark for the first five months of FY25. However, in September, the index witnessed  a  ten-month  low,  but  it  quickly  rebounded  in  October.  The  recent  data 5 indicates  demand  buoyancy  continued  to  drive  new  business  inflows  higher,  which in  turn  supported output growth and prompted firms to recruit additional workers. Finance &amp; insurance registered strongest increases in both new orders and business activity at the sub-sector level.
