## SOCIAL SECTOR: EXTENDING REACH AND DRIVING EMPOWERMENT

11

India's economic growth strategy emphasises inclusivity and welfare for all its citizens. The government's focus is on empowering citizens through education, healthcare, skill development, and social infrastructure development. All these aspects have seen significant progress. Further enhancements are still possible by improving delivery systems through innovation and technology.

For example, achieving improved educational outcomes and healthcare access can  be  accomplished  with  innovative  solutions,  such  as  integrating  new teaching methods and preventive healthcare strategies. Peer learning, life skills, and social  and  emotional  learning  hold  great  potential  for  fostering  lifelong learning.  Additionally,  prioritising  mental  health  in  the  workplace  not  only matters for overall well-being and a harmonious society but can also enhance worker productivity. A strong focus on preventing non-communicable diseases combined with the use of technology can be economically effective, significantly reducing the cost burden on healthcare systems.

## INTRODUCTION

11.1  The virtuous cycle of economic and social development starts with sustainable and inclusive economic growth. While growth expands the economic pie, development represents the process of sustained economic progress and is a medium to long-term outcome of growth. Such growth supports inclusion by providing better and more equal opportunities, enhancing incomes, and reducing extreme poverty. Inclusive growth also improves the overall living standards of citizens of the country in terms of healthcare, education, basic necessities of life and livelihood.

11.2  For growth to transition into meaningful development, sound, effective, holistic, and comprehensive policies are indispensable. Focus is required on education, health, social  security,  enhancing  employment  opportunities  through  skilling  etc.  These translate to improved quality of social and economic infrastructure in the country.  In alignment with this vision for growth-led-development, the government has adopted interventions  to  ensure  welfare  for  all.  Inclusive  economic  growth  is  central  to  the vision of Viksit Bharat 2047 .

11.3  Social sector policies need to consider the complex interplay of multiple factors which  eventually  determine  their  success.  For  example,  a  policy  to  improve  school education may not be very effective without policies related to healthcare, food and nutritional  security,  access  to  transport  facilities,  and  household  income  playing  as the  contributing  factors  to  a  child  continuing  school.  Further,  policies  are  required to  aim towards empowering citizens and enhancing their capability to achieve their aspirations.  This  requires  providing  them  with  opportunities  for  self-growth  and progress. In keeping with this understanding, the focus is on all-round development to  ensure  a  better  quality  of  life  for  all  citizens  through  efficient  delivery  of  welfare measures.  Government  programmes  are  being  designed  to  reach  citizens  costeffectively, leveraging user-friendly dashboards and management information systems for real-time monitoring, promoting transparency and accountability.

## Trend in social services expenditure

11.4  The general government's social sector expenditure has been keeping pace with the sector's growing importance. The general government's social services 1  expenditure (SSE) has shown a rising trend since FY17. The SSE as a percentage of total expenditure (TE) has increased from 23.3 per cent in FY21 to 26.2 per cent in FY25 (BE). The social services expenditure witnessed an increase of 21 per cent in FY24 (RE) over FY23 and another 10 per cent increase in FY25 (BE) over FY24 (RE). During the five years from FY21 (pandemic year) to FY25 (BE), the SSE grew at a CAGR of 15 per cent. While the SSE outlay of the centre and state governments was ₹14.8 lakh crore in FY21, it has increased steadily to stand at ₹25.7 lakh crore in FY25 (BE). Expenditure on education has grown at a CAGR of 12 per cent from ₹ 5.8 lakh crore in FY21 to ₹ 9.2 lakh crore in FY25 (BE). 2 Expenditure on health grew at CAGR 18 per cent from ₹ 3.2 lakh crore in FY21 to ₹ 6.1 lakh crore in FY25 (BE). 3

1   Social services include, education, sports, art and culture; medical and public health, family welfare; water supply and sanitation; housing; urban development; welfare of SCs, STs and OBCs, labour and labour welfare; social security and welfare, nutrition, relief on account of natural calamities etc.

2  Expenditure on 'Education' pertains to expenditure on education, sports, arts and culture.

3  Expenditure on 'Health' includes expenditure on 'Medical and Public Health', 'Family Welfare' and 'Water Supply and Sanitation'.

Note: *The Ministry of Education (MoE), Government of India, also calculates the General Government spending on education. While RBI's data on Education expenditure incorporates the spending incurred by Centre and States on 'Education, Sports, Arts, and culture, MoE's estimates also include expenditure incurred on medical and public health education, agriculture research and education, welfare of SC, ST, OBC &amp; Minority's education, other scientific research &amp; development, Education under social security, Nutritious food expenditure under mid-day  meal,  expenditure  on  imparting  training  to  police,  Labour  employment  and  skill  development expenditure, education/training expenditure under rural development Programmes etc. This leads to a higher estimate of expenditure on education. The latest available estimate is for the year 2021-22 (BE).

## Household Consumption Expenditure Survey 2023-24

11.5  The results of the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2023-24 4 highlights  the  narrowing  urban-rural  gap  in  consumption  expenditure.  The  average monthly  per  capita  expenditure  (MPCE)  in  rural  and  urban  India  in  2023-24  is

4  The survey period is August 2023 to July 2024. (https://tinyurl.com/syyuey62)

estimated at ₹4,122 and ₹6,996, respectively. 5  Considering the imputed values of items received free of cost through various social welfare programmes, these estimates rise to ₹4,247 and ₹7,078, respectively, for rural and urban areas. 6  The urban-rural gap in MPCE has declined to 71 per cent in 2022-23 from 84 per cent in 2011-12. It has further come down to 70 per cent in 2023-24, which confirms the sustained momentum of consumption growth in rural areas.

11.6  Social  sector  initiatives  have  reduced  inequality  and  increased  consumption spending,  as  reflected  in  the  survey.  The  Gini  coefficient  improved  for  rural  areas (declined to 0.237 in 2023-24 from 0.266 in 2022-23) and urban areas (declined to 0.284 in 2023-24 from 0.314 in 2022-23). The bottom 5 per cent of the rural population, ranked by MPCE, has an average MPCE of ₹1,677, compared to ₹2,376 in urban areas. The top 5 per cent have average MPCEs of ₹10,137 in rural and ₹20,310 in urban areas.

11.7    The  largest  growth  in  average  MPCE  between  2022-23 and 2023-24 occurred among the bottom 5-10 per cent  of  the  population  in  both  rural  and  urban  areas. The bottom 5 per cent of the rural population saw a 22 per cent increase, while the corresponding urban segment experienced 19 per cent growth in the MPCE.

11.8  The Economic Survey 2023-24 (chapter 7) highlighted how the welfare policies of the government and the social sector initiatives have resulted in the reduction of inequality marked by rising consumption expenditure, as evident from the results of

5  The figures do not consider the values of items received free of cost by the households through various social welfare programmes.

6  (i) food items: Rice, Wheat/Atta, Jowar, Bajra, Maize, Ragi, Barley, Small Millets, Pulses, Gram, Salt, Sugar, Edible Oil and (ii) non-food items: Laptop/PC, Tablet, Mobile Handset, Bicycle, Motor Cycle/Scooty, Clothing (school uniform), Footwear (school shoe etc.) received free of cost by the households through government programmes, have been imputed. Accordingly, another set of estimates of MPCE considering imputed values of these items and of consumption out of home produce, free collection, gifts, loans etc. has also been compiled for HCES: 2023-24.

the HCES 2022-23. Fiscal policies of the government are playing a key role in reshaping income distribution, inter-alia, through the provision of subsidies, pensions, and other direct transfers, as well as public spending on social services such as education and health.  Various  government  welfare  schemes  such  as  free  foodgrain  or  subsidised availability  of  foodgrains,  subsidised  cooking  fuel,  insurance  cover,  etc,  are  lifting household incomes. These fiscal transfers help to provide additional resources to the financially deprived sections and, thus, favourably impact people's standard of living. 7 As an example, building upon the learnings of the HCES, a study by the World Bank 8 presents evidence of the re-distribution impact of the Public Distribution System (PDS).

Box XI.1 discusses this evidence.

## Box XI.1:  Evidence on the distribution of benefits from the PDS

Food subsidies constitute the largest fiscal outlay in the government's large set of social schemes. In 2022-23, Union government spent 6.5 per cent of its budget on the PM Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) to provide free and subsidised food rations. As  food  subsidies  were  expanded  (and  consolidated  under  the  PMGKAY)  as  part  of  the emergency fiscal response to COVID-19, the Union food subsidy bill increased from 0.5 per cent to one per cent of GDP between FY19 and FY23. Microdata from the HCES 2022-23 confirm that most households currently purchase food rations-at a subsidised price or free of cost-via the PDS and PMGKAY entitlements. The widespread coverage of ration cards protects low income and vulnerable populations.

The  survey  also  provides  insights  into  the  allocation  of  these  benefits  across  different segments of the population. In 2022-23, 84 per cent of the population had access to a ration card, including 59 per cent who reported holding a Below Poverty Line (BPL), Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY),  or  Priority  Household  (PHH)  card  in  their  household.  In  practice, 74 per cent of the population actively consumes food rations (or kerosene) via the PDS/ PMGKAY, with rice and wheat as the most commonly consumed food. Coverage of ration cards is higher in rural areas (at 89 per cent of the population) compared to urban areas (72 per cent).

## The PDS/PMGKAY rations improve welfare

An imputation exercise was conducted 9 based on HCES microdata to evaluate the welfare gains from PDS-related consumption. The results suggest that the market-equivalent value of the PDS/PMGKY subsidy equals four per cent of the (final or post-subsidy) nominal

7   For more detailed discussion on this aspect, refer to Chapter 2, 'Perspectives on the Inequality Debate in India', of  the  Ministry  of  Finance's  publication,  'RE-EXAMINING  NARRATIVES:  A  Collection  of  Essays',    https:// tinyurl.com/2nt6mubz

8 This work was undertaken by World Bank staff, under the Taskforce on Indian Statistical System led by the NITI Aayog.

9 Following international best practices, the unitary value of food rations and kerosene consumption obtained via the PDS/PMGKAY, in 2011-12 and 2022-23, are imputed. The methodology aims to find an equivalent valuation of the PDS/PMGKAY items (paid at subsidised prices or received free of cost) in the local market economy for each household consuming rations in the survey.

monthly consumption expenditure per capita (MPCE), on average, across all households. 10 The relative subsidy is higher in rural (four per cent) than in urban areas (two per cent). The imputed average subsidy is also equivalent to 7 per cent of (post-subsidy) food consumption (eight per cent among rural households). The average PDS benefits increased in 2022-23, relative to three per cent in 2011-12.

The imputation exercise suggests that the benefits (expressed relative to consumption) are higher among lower consumption groups. In 2022-23, the value of the subsidy accounted, on average, for seven per cent of household consumption among the rural bottom 20 per cent but only for two per cent among the top 20 per cent. A similar progressive pattern is observed in urban areas. The benefits are seen to decrease for higher consumption groups but remain positive. Across all quintiles, the relative benefits have increased since 201112. Finally, the PDS subsidy was also progressive in absolute terms. The subsidy amount (rupees per capita) was higher among lower-income and rural households and lower among higher quintiles and urban households. The concentration of larger benefits among lower consumption groups suggests that the PDS/PMGKAY policies support the low income and protect other vulnerable households against income fluctuations and impoverishment.

11.9    Box XI.2 offers a clearer insight into the consumption patterns and choices of rural  households benefiting from direct benefit transfers (DBTs) and women in the target population obtaining loans from self-help groups (SHGs) based on findings from a primary survey. 11   The survey was conducted in selected districts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh in November 2024.

## Box XI.2: Consumption choices of rural households: Direct benefit transfers and self-help groups

To better understand the consumption choices of rural households, a survey was conducted among married women aged 25 to 45 in rural areas who were relatively less financially privileged.  The  survey  focused  on  those  receiving  loans  from  SHGs,  representing  a population poorer than the average Indian population.  The survey aimed to explore key aspects of women's labour force participation, household decision-making, and the impact of welfare schemes.

The survey asked respondents about their access to government schemes (e.g., Jal Jeevan Mission, PM Kisan Samman Nidhi, Ayushman Bharat, Swachh Bharat Mission - Grameen) and how they utilised funds when the schemes were delivered in cash, such as direct deposits into their or a household member's account. In total, 59 per cent of respondents reported that

10    The average subsidy is calculated across all Indian households. Considering only those households that consumed PDS items over the past 30 days, the market-equivalent value of the PDS subsidy is equivalent to 5 per cent of their (post-subsidy) MPCE or 10 per cent of (post-subsidy) food MPCE.

11    Artha  Global's  Centre  for  Rapid  Insights  (CRI)  conducted  a  survey  of  approximately  2400  married  women between the ages of 25 and 45 in rural areas, who were relatively less financially privileged, in selected districts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh in November 2024.

The sample population is poorer than the Indian population on average. This demographic group was chosen for study because an increased female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) has been observed among this group. Furthermore, as a popular target for DBTs and cash as well as loans through SHGs from both the Centre and various state governments, a survey of this group allows for an analysis of patterns of consumption due to cash transfers and loans.

the  primary  benefit  of  government  schemes  was  an  increase  in  the  quality  of  life.  In comparison,  another  19  per  cent  reported  that  the  primary  benefit  was  more  time  for economic activity. Evidence shows that government schemes have spurred consumption and income-generating activity in low-income households. The prevalence of cash schemes is also very high among the surveyed households, with 77 per cent of households receiving cash from either the centre or a state government, indicating a preference towards cash schemes among economically vulnerable households. The data suggests that economically disadvantaged households demonstrate a preference for cash schemes, likely attributable to the financial empowerment facilitated by the schemes.

These cash transfers are relatively universal and typically impose low levels of conditionality; that is, cash is often given as a function of government-verified social attributes rather than hard-to-monitor behaviours by the household. From a theoretical perspective, it is often argued that imposing strong conditions on cash receipts denies households the ability to use cash where they most need to use it.

The data show sophisticated expenditure patterns from household cash benefits. Overall, 44 per cent of the surveyed households spend the money on increased food consumption, and another 31 per cent spend primarily on non-food consumption (e.g., electricity, water), savings, or loan repayments, while 14 per cent spend on house repair.

However,  there  is  a  significant  variation  in  expenditure  patterns  by  wealth.  Among  the 10 per cent of 'better off' households in the sample, 52 per cent primarily spend on food consumption, and less than 20 per cent primarily spend on non-food consumption, savings, or loan repayments. Among the remaining households, 43 per cent primarily spend on food consumption, and 32 per cent primarily spend on non-food consumption, savings, or loan repayments - suggesting far more diverse expenditure patterns among the less well-off sections of society, bearing in mind that the entire sample itself consists of less financially privileged households.

A significant share of the sample (37 per cent) is engaged in SHGs. Among those in SHGs, 78 per cent have received a loan. While household consumption (34 per cent) is the most reported usage for SHG loans, there is significant usage for health expenditure (22 per cent), starting businesses (19 per cent) and agricultural expenditure (19 per cent). Relatively low use for education (3 per cent) may point to the success of DBTs provided for education.

This highlights the consumption benefits of cash transfers and loans to targeted poorer and lower-income households. These households report using the funds for various basic needs and debt repayments. The exercise reinforces the case for replacing in-kind subsidies with direct and targeted cash transfers.

11.10 Against  this  background,  the  chapter  highlights  the  progress  made  by  the economy in terms of economic well-being and presents certain challenges on the way. Section 1 discusses the education initiatives with a focus on foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN), the integration of social and emotional learning (SEL) in the school curriculum, and the importance of digital literacy in a technology-driven world. The section also addresses higher education challenges faced in medical education and the

role of regulation. Section 2 presents the situation in the health space in the country, its  progress, and challenges. It further highlights the role of disruptive technologies in providing equitable healthcare and the impact of lifestyle choices on mental wellbeing. Section 3 explores the rural economy, focusing on infrastructure development and housing as key drivers of economic growth while advocating for the localisation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to foster rural progress.

## EDUCATION: TREADING NEW PATHWAYS

11.11  Education plays a key role in developing an economy by cultivating individuals capable  of  rational  thought  and  unleashing  their  agency  to  better  themselves  and society. Education and human capital development are among the foundational pillars of development. The National Education Policy 2020(NEP) is built upon this principle. 12 The NEP states that -

'It aims at producing engaged, productive, and contributing citizens for building an equitable, inclusive, and plural society as envisaged by our Constitution.'

## School education

11.12    India's  school  education  system  serves  24.8  crore  students  across  14.72  lakh schools with 98 lakh teachers (UDISE+ 2023-24). Government schools make up 69 per cent of the total, enrolling 50 per cent of students and employing 51 per cent of teachers, while private schools account for 22.5 per cent, enrolling 32.6 per cent of students and employing 38 per cent of teachers. The NEP 2020 aims for a 100 per cent Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by 2030. The GER is near-universal at the primary (93 per cent) and the efforts are underway to bridge the gaps at the secondary (77.4 per cent) and higher secondary level (56.2 per cent), driving the nation closer to its vision of inclusive and equitable education for all. 13

11.13    School dropout rates 14 have steadily declined in recent years, standing at 1.9 per cent for primary, 5.2 per cent for upper primary, and 14.1 per cent for secondary levels. However, challenges persist, with retention rates 15 at 85.4 per cent for primary (class I to V), 78 per cent for elementary (classes I to VIII), 63.8 per cent for secondary (classes I to X), and 45.6 per cent for higher secondary (classes I to XII). Improvements in basic facilities and infrastructure, including medical check-ups, sanitation, and information and  communication  technologies  (ICT)  availability,  have  been  notable,  reflecting  a positive trend in school infrastructure development. 16

11.14   The government has been striving to achieve the objectives of NEP 2020 through a range of programmes and schemes, including the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan (along with its sub-schemes such as NISHTHA, Vidya Pravesh, District Institutes of Education and  Training  (DIETs),  Kasturba  Gandhi  Balika  Vidyalaya  (KGBV),  etc.),  DIKSHA 17 , STARS 18 ,  PARAKH 19 ,  PM  SHRI 20 ,  ULLAS 21 ,  and  PM  POSHAN 22 ,  among  others.  The Economic  Survey  2023-24  (Chapter  7,  Table  VII.4)  highlighted  the  progress  made under various government initiatives in school education.

11.15   The pivotal role of early years in development is well-recognised by the Indian education system, as 85 per cent of brain development occurs before the age of six years. To strengthen the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) landscape, the government launched the National Curriculum for ECCE, Aadharshila ,  and the National Framework for Early Childhood Stimulation, Navchetana , in April 2024. Navchetana focuses on holistic development for children from birth to three years, offering 140 agespecific activities through a 36-month stimulation calendar. It emphasises the inclusion of differently-abled children, maternal mental health, and " Garbh Sanskar " (practices during pregnancy). Aadharshila , blending Indian and international research, promotes play-based learning with over 130 activities for children aged three to six years that support  child-led  and  educator-led  learning.  It  aims  to  lay  a  strong  foundation  for lifelong learning, aligning with the National Curriculum Framework for Foundational

## Building strong foundations through literacy and numeracy

11.16 School education lays the foundation of a country's education system. The NEP 2020 stipulates that foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) is critical for education and lifelong learning success. Towards this end, the Department of School Education &amp; Literacy launched the National Mission, 'National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN Bharat),' 23  in July 2021 to ensure that every child in the country necessarily attains FLN by the end of Grade 3, by 202627. 24     It  covers three years of FLN in preschool and Grades 1, 2 and 3. Towards this, the  education  system  is  deploying  innovative  pedagogies  and  teaching  methods  to ensure that every child achieves FLN. Box XI.3 discusses one such innovation, viz. peer teaching.

## Box XI.3: Peer Teaching: A pathway to achieving FLN

Achieving the vision of universal FLN by Grade 3 requires not only reaching every child but  also  overcoming  the  limitations  of  traditional  lecture-based  teaching  to  address diverse learning needs. While teacher-led instruction is valuable, it may not fully support individualised learning, especially for children who lag behind and need extra support to catch up.

State governments have launched programmes to tackle these challenges. Mission Ankur in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat focuses on engaging schools and communities for the holistic development  of  primary  students,  ensuring  they  achieve  FLN  skills. 25 Similarly,  Bihar's Mission Daksh aims  to  provide  personalised  mentoring  for  lagging  students  to  achieve grade-level competencies by 2025. While these initiatives address key gaps, they heavily rely on teachers, highlighting the need for scalable, adaptable teaching strategies that offer personalisation without overburdening educators.

Peer teaching is a promising solution, where students learn by teaching and supporting their peers.  In  classrooms  with  limited  resources  and  high  student-teacher  ratios,  it  provides scalable, accessible support tailored to students' needs. As 'Student Champions,' older or more knowledgeable students help guide younger or struggling peers through foundational concepts.

Peer teaching creates a collaborative environment where students learn from each other, boosting confidence and comprehension alongside teacher instruction. The NEP promotes

peer tutoring to foster inclusion and personalised learning, ensuring every child can learn. 26 It also encourages using community volunteers and alumni as peer tutors in schools and communities.  The  SARTHAQ  (Students'  and  Teachers'  Holistic  Advancement  through Quality  Education)  guidelines  for  NEP  2020 27 emphasise  peer  tutoring  to  improve  FLN and educational outcomes, highlighting the need for training peer tutors and integrating sessions into school schedules.

Global evidence supports peer learning, showing improved academic performance in math and reading in the US 28 , enhanced problem-solving abilities and social skills in Australia 29 , and  better  literacy  outcomes  in  sub-Saharan  Africa 30 .  In  sub-Saharan  Africa  peer-led programmes  have  successfully  supported  student-centred  learning  in  under-resourced classrooms.  Additionally,  peer  teaching  fosters  essential  life  skills  such  as  leadership, empathy, resilience, and communication, benefiting both tutors and learners.

## Experiments in integrating structured peer learning in India's Education system

The Nalli-Kali  (joyful  learning  in  Kannada)  programme ,  launched  in  1995  in Karnataka's  Mysuru  district,  focuses  on  peer  and  group  work  to  create  a  collaborative classroom  environment  that  supports  self-paced,  personalised  learning.  It  is  now  the primary pedagogy for Grades 1-3 in Karnataka to develop age-appropriate skills. 31

The Prerana  model  of  education ,  implemented  in  Andhra  Pradesh,  Karnataka, Maharashtra,  Tamil  Nadu,  and  Telangana 32   through  the  Sikshana  Foundation,  also emphasises peer learning and group work. 33  Small groups of four to five students collaborate on classroom activities, teaching and learning from each other.

Involve Learning Solutions Foundation 34 is  working with educators in six districts across Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Karnataka states to integrate structured peer teaching into government schools, directly aligning with NIPUN Bharat's FLN goals. The model pairs among students identified as 'Student Champions' with 'Learners.' Each Student Champion, with better subject mastery, is trained further to support a group of four learners, their peers

26    The NEP in para 2.7 provides that, 'Due to the scale of the current learning crisis, all viable methods will be explored to support teachers in the mission of attaining universal foundational literacy and numeracy. Studies around the world show one-on-one peer tutoring to be extremely effective for learning not just for the learner, but also for the tutor. Thus, peer tutoring can be taken up as a voluntary and joyful activity for fellow students under the supervision of trained teachers and by taking due care of safety aspects.'; https://tinyurl.com/mxp5wpfz

who struggle to understand concepts, thereby facilitating their progress through 40-minute sessions three to four times per week.

Early  evaluations  in  Karnataka's  Anekal  block  show  increased  learning  outcomes  in numeracy for students by 15 per cent compared to students who did not participate in the programme. 35   Similarly,  in  Bhagalpur,  structured  peer  interactions  have  helped  bridge reading and numeracy gaps among children who could not meet age-appropriate learning milestones.  Anecdotal  evidence  also  indicates  positive  shifts  in  student  engagement  and academic outcomes.

To  support  NIPUN  Bharat's  mission,  peer  teaching  can  be  integrated  into  India's  FLN strategy. This involves incorporating peer teaching into teacher training, scaling successful models, assessing its impact on learning outcomes, and using data to refine the approach based on feedback from teachers, students, and administrators. This will help transform classrooms into dynamic spaces where every child receives the support needed to thrive.

## Empowering minds: Unlocking potential with social and emotional learning

11.17    The  success  of  school  education  hinges  not  just  on  the  student's  academic achievements but also on enhancing their social and emotional learning (SEL). A good education enhances a child's mental and physical health, academic performance, and life skills. In this context, ECCE under NEP 2020 aims to achieve foundational literacy and socio-emotional development. The NEP 2020 states that

'The  overall  aim  of  ECCE  will  be  to  attain  optimal  outcomes  in  the  domains  of physical and motor development, cognitive development, socio-emotional-ethical development ,  cultural/artistic development, and the development of communication and early language, literacy, and numeracy.'

11.18 Box XI.4 discusses the importance of SEL in education, providing examples of how the pedagogy can be developed to incorporate socio-emotional-ethical development in the school curriculum.

## Box XI.4: Empowering minds and hearts through SEL techniques

SEL has emerged as a critical pillar within holistic education frameworks that contributes significantly to SDGs, particularly SDG 3 (Good Health &amp; Well-being) &amp; SDG 4 (Quality Education). UNESCO 36  defines SEL as a process of acquiring the competencies to recognise

and manage  emotions, develop care and concern for others, establish positive relationships, make responsible decisions, and handle challenging situations effectively . SEL  significantly  contributes  to  individual  well-being,  social  participation,  and  broader individual development. Incorporating SEL from an early age equips children with essential skills that foster resilience and academic success. It also plays a crucial role in preventing future mental health issues and setting the foundation for a healthier society.

CASEL (Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning) 37  outlines five core components of SEL, which serve as foundational pillars in fostering holistic development. These  components-Self-Awareness,  Self-Management,  Social  Awareness,  Relationship Skills,  and  Responsible  Decision-Making-equip  students  with  the  skills  necessary  to navigate life challenges, enhance mental well-being, and improve academic performance. Some successful models effectively implementing SEL programmes worldwide include the Social, Emotional, and Ethical Learning (SEE Learning) by Emory University, 38 and  the RULER programme 39 by Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence.

According  to  some  estimates,  for  every  dollar  invested  in  SEL  initiatives,  the  estimated long-term economic return is USD 11, with outcomes around mental health, education, and employability. 40  Further, a 2020 UNESCO study 41 , highlights that such investments not only yield immediate educational and behavioural benefits but also result in long-term economic gains, including a 30 per cent increase in per capita income. The literature indicates that integrating  SEL  components  into  classroom  practices  increases  student  commitment 42 , participation, 43 cognitive problem-solving abilities, 44  attendance rates, and overall academic success. 45   Other than enhancing academic performance, these interventions also promote positive social behaviour and interpersonal relationships, mitigate behavioural issues and

## Developments in India

The NEP 2020 emphasises the development of social, ethical, and emotional competencies as essential to holistic child development. The National Curriculum Framework 2023 47  also advocates for SEL-based pedagogies to improve educational outcomes and foster children's well-being.  The  NIPUN  Bharat  mission  guidelines  2021 48 emphasise  the  importance of SEL as a core component of the holistic development objectives for young children in India's  foundational  education  system.  It  promotes  activities  that  foster  self-awareness, social awareness, and responsible decision-making, advocating for inclusive, child-centred practices to create safe, supportive learning environments that nurture both cognitive and emotional growth.

SEL is increasingly being recognised as integral to India's educational and developmental priorities.    Initiatives  like    SEE  Learning  India 49 and  the  Life  Skills  Collaborative 50 are paving the way for SEL in structured approaches. They are being adopted in the states of Maharashtra,  Mizoram,  Uttarakhand,  and  Rajasthan.  SEL  interventions  are  also  being carried out in programmes implemented by the governments of Tripura and Uttarakhand etc. In several programmes, state governments have collaborated with non-profit organisations like  Dream  a  Dream  Foundation 51   and  Labhya 52 .  Under  these  models,  classrooms  are envisaged as emotionally safe environments wherein children experience interactive group sessions, mindful practices, and spaces for reflection sharing to cope with various challenges and improve their well-being and learning outcomes. Through organisations such as the Aparajitha Foundation, students are taught important life skills, i.e., social and interpersonal skills, that can help them make informed decisions, communicate effectively, and develop coping and self-management skills (See Box XI.5 ).

The evidence supporting the benefits of SEL is robust. The imperative of integrating SEL with  educational  frameworks  is  underscored  by  its  profound  impact  on  mental  health, academic success, and long-term life outcomes. This is particularly crucial in India, which is characterised by a youthful population poised to enter the workforce. The implementation of SEL, therefore, serves as a strategic investment in the nation's future.

11.19  NEP  2020  emphasises  holistic  schooling  by  integrating  vocational  and  digital education with a supporting, well-equipped school infrastructure to enable the smooth transition of a GER of 100 per cent at the secondary level by 2030.

11.20  The  importance  of  skill  education  in  schools  has  grown  significantly  with  the advent of Industry 4.0, a highly dynamic and skill-intensive era defined by automation, artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), big data, and robotics. This industrial revolution has reshaped production and distribution across sectors like manufacturing and agriculture, significantly increasing the demand for a skilled workforce. Alongside technical proficiency, soft skills such as adaptability, problem-solving, and collaboration have become critical for navigating this evolving landscape. Box XI.5 discusses the Tim Tim Tare initiative for imparting life skills.

## Box XI.5: Imparting life skills: The Tim Tim Tare initiative

Tim Tim Tare (TTT) 53  is a pioneering initiative that aims to impart essential life skills to adolescent  students  across  India.  Unlike  vocational  training,  which  focuses  on  technical skills,  TTT  places  emphasis  on  soft  skills-key  components  of  personal  growth,  effective communication, emotional intelligence, and social well-being. Through TTT, students are empowered to face life's challenges confidently and clearly.

This  initiative  equips  students  with  essential  life  skills  to  navigate  the  complexities  of modern life. Built on the World Health Organization's (WHO) Life Skills Framework, TTT addresses a wide range of 16 core life skills (such as empathy, critical thinking, etiquette, time management, etc) and over 100 related topics designed to meet the evolving needs of today's youth. These skills enable students to make informed, thoughtful decisions personally and professionally and equip them with the skills and attitudes necessary to thrive in their studies and beyond.

TTT's  approach  stands  apart  from  traditional  education  due  to  its  student-focused methodology, delivering content in an engaging, immersive manner  and  creating transformative experiences enabling students to absorb, internalise, and retain key concepts effectively. Each topic is designed with activity-based learning, such as experience sharing, role plays, sing-along songs and interactive games. This approach ensures that every lesson is  lively,  impactful,  and  engaging,  allowing  students  to  experience  the  learning  process actively.

Started in 2009 in Tamil Nadu, TTT has now expanded to other states 54  in a phased manner, reaching millions of students across India. In addition to empowering students, TTT has prioritised training thousands of teachers across these states, ensuring that the programme's benefits are deeply rooted and widely disseminated.

A critical focus of TTT has been its commitment to understanding and addressing the needs of its stakeholders. Feedback from students, teachers, principals, and parents has been

53  https://tinyurl.com/5yxkwerv

54  Such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, etc.

systematically collected over the years. This feedback consistently highlights the programme's positive impact on individuals and communities and is a testament to TTT's transformative power and ability to create lasting change.

The  TTT  programme  currently  reaches  more  than  10  crore  students,  with  a  significant presence  in  central  India  and  Gujarat.  It  is  implemented  in  various  types  of  schools, including  government  schools, Navodaya  Vidyalayas,  Kendriya  Vidyalayas,  Kasturba Vidyalayas , juvenile homes etc. It is also accessible through various platforms such as PM eVidya channels, state government relay centres, YouTube, and WhatsApp groups.

The State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) officially approved the TTT programme, which adds credibility and ensures alignment with national educational standards.

## Bridging the gap: Digital technology in education and the essentiality of digital literacy

11.21   Digital literacy ensures that students remain competitive by mastering skills like analysing, synthesising, and communicating digital information. The World Economic Forum (WEF) identifies  ICT  skills  as  foundational  for  the  21st  century. 55   UNESCO defines digital literacy as- ' Includes competencies that are variously referred to as computer literacy,  ICT  literacy,  information  literacy  and  media  literacy '. 56 Digital literacy ranges from basic hardware and software use to advanced programming and network management.

11.22 Data from the Comprehensive Annual Modular Survey 2022-23 reveals a ruralurban digital divide in India with lower internet-searching capabilities in rural areas, especially among females. 57  Sixty-three per cent of males and 55 per cent of females in rural areas can search the internet for information compared to 74 per cent males and 69 per cent of females in urban areas. The results highlight the need for focused efforts to close the digital gap.

11.23 The NEP 2020 emphasises technology's role in improving education, removing barriers, and ensuring inclusivity for Divyang students. Schemes like DIKSHA, 58 Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds (SWAYAM) 59 , e-VIDYA 60 , Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA) 61   and e-content for Divyang are  in  place  to  achieve  the  objective  of  inclusive  digital  education.

11.24 The rapid pace of technological change requires educators to stay up-to-date on  new  digital  trends  and  teaching  methods.  In  an  effort  to  leverage  technology towards enhancing the capabilities of educators and preparing them for the demands of the 21 st  century, the government has launched TeacherApp 63 , a cutting-edge digital platform. The application offers over 260 hours of resources, including courses, videos, podcasts, and live expert sessions. It also features Teaching Kits with 900 hours of content, providing teachers with essential tools such as lesson plans, worksheets, and project-based  learning  activities.  The  application  empowers  teachers  with  essential skills and continuous capacity-building through innovative content and communitybuilding features. It is accessible across multiple devices and offers practical strategies for improving pedagogical practices and student engagement.

11.25 Investments in skills, research, innovation ecosystems, government-academic partnerships, and faculty development are pivotal for efficiently delivering education services  and  improving  learning  outcomes.  Technology  acts  as  a  powerful  enabler, driving scalability, equity, accessibility, and sustainable learning opportunities across diverse groups, including schools, polytechnics, higher education institutions, out-ofjob youth, and working professionals. Box XI.6 discusses this further.

## Box XI.6: Leveraging technology for efficient and effective education delivery.

The  integration  of  technology,  including  AI,  has  become  essential  in  addressing  the rapidly evolving dynamics of the education system. AI-powered learning systems enable personalised learning experiences tailored to individual students' pace and comprehension, contrasting with traditional approaches that rely on a standardised curriculum and uniform pace for all learners. Additionally, AI facilitates adaptive assessments, aligning with students' unique needs and fostering growth at their own pace. The incorporation of technology also presents cost-effective solutions, making quality education more accessible and inclusive for a broader population.

To improve education systems, technology integration may be focused on three key areas: using AI for teacher development and student tutoring, integrating industry-relevant skills and certifications, and creating personalised learning software. These are discussed below.

## Leveraging AI for teachers' professional development and providing AI-driven personal tutors for students

AI can automate tasks like lesson planning, assessment development, and fostering critical thinking, freeing teachers to focus on instruction and mentoring. AI tutors can assist across subjects, offering students the necessary support and allowing them to learn at their own pace and requirements. AI personal tutors may enhance learning with resource guidance, career counselling, and problem-solving strategies. Additionally, AI-driven analytics help teachers tailor their methods to students' needs, and AI-powered platforms can recommend personalised professional development to support teachers' growth. AI can also help both teachers and students in conducting automated assessments and helping in personalised learning of the student.

The government is envisioning and developing e-learning through digital pedagogy as a longterm strategy for the education sector. Various initiatives, such as PM eVidya, DIKSHA, and SWAYAM, are part of this effort. The government has also announced the establishment of a platform under DIKSHA to incorporate advanced technologies like AI and machine learning (ML). 64

## Integrating industry-relevant skills and certifications into education

Incorporating  industry-relevant  skills  and  certifications  into  the  educational  curriculum will improve the workforce's employability. This may be achieved through the provision of certifications into education through partnerships with industry and certification bodies, practical training modules and AI-driven learning experiences.

Realising  the  importance  of  the  industry-academia  linkage,  the  Ministry  of  Education introduced  the  Apprenticeship  Embedded  Degree/Diploma  Programme  in  2020-21  to improve students' employability. Additionally, the National Credit Framework (NCrF) allows for  the  creditisation for apprenticeship learning hours subject to assessment/ evaluation of  the  same.  NCrF  also  recommended  the  expansion  of  the  Academic  Bank  of  Credit (ABC) to include credits earned through apprenticeships, internships, project work, etc. 65 The National Apprenticeship Promotion Scheme provides financial support to industrial establishments undertaking apprenticeship programmes under the Apprentices Act, 1961.

## Building  personalised  learning  software  layers  &amp;  developing  AI  labs  for research, learning and skilling

AI personal tutors in such labs can enormously benefit students across all disciplines and can be a huge aid for them. Virtual Science and AI labs offer unique, beyond-the-classroom experiences. These innovations enhance learning, strengthen foundational skills, and offer cost-effective solutions.

Taking  a  step  in  this  direction,  Atal  Innovation  Mission  (AIM)  has  introduced  Frontier Technology Labs (FTLs) on the foundation of Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs). FTL will provide students access to advanced technologies, including AI, AR/VR, blockchain, cybersecurity, robotics,  3D  printing,  and  IoT.  Building  on  the  foundation  of  ATLs,  which  have  been established in 10,000 schools across 722 districts, FTLs are designed to equip students with the skills required for the evolving technological landscape. 66

In conclusion, it is crucial to leverage technology to transform the educational landscape in India. By doing so, a more efficient, effective, and future-ready education system can be created.

11.26 While online learning and digital technology have expanded access to education, the traditional method of learning through physical methods in the classroom still holds merit.  The Tamil Nadu government launched a cost-effective remedial programme to bring education to students' doorstep to bridge the learning gaps created by the covid 19 pandemic and ensure equity leading to improvements in learning ( Box XI.7 ).

## Box XI.7:  Tamil Nadu's Illam Thedi Kalvi (Education at Doorstep): Innovation in public education

The Illam Thedi Kalvi Scheme was launched by the Tamil Nadu government to bridge the education gap brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic and the digital divide. The initiative focuses on education through physical methods, which is the primary goal of the Illam Thedi Kalvi . 67

The scheme was designed during Covid-19 to reduce students' reliance on internet resources for  their  learning,  with  volunteers  assisting  them.  These  volunteers  conducted  door-todoor efforts to educate the students. The initiative is helping close the educational gap by providing  every  student  in  Tamil  Nadu  the  opportunity  to  receive  education  through  this scheme.

The State Planning Commission conducted a rapid assessment of the programme's impact through a comprehensive survey in September 2022. This assessment involved the active participation of volunteers, teachers, headmasters, and parents from 362 schools across six districts: Ariyalur, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, Salem, Thiruvarur, and Villupuram. 68 Parents reported  a  noticeable  improvement  in  their  children's  learning  experiences,  noting  that education has become a more enjoyable activity for them. At the same time, the teachers confirmed that the play-based approach has reignited children's interest in learning. As a result, students were interacting more freely and actively participating in regular classes. Students showed a greater interest in mathematics and made significant progress in language skills in their standard classrooms.

The scheme continues, post the pandemic, to provide necessary support to the students through remedial lessons. The scheme's volunteers work year-round to integrate out-ofschool children into mainstream education, with particular attention to girls, Children with special needs (CwSN), transgender children, and those from migrant worker families. The volunteers can apply online to be a part of the programme and are also given monthly pay. The programme is managed with effective use of technology. To monitor the learning levels of primary school children, volunteers have been given achievement charts to record their progress.

## Children  with  Special  Needs  (CwSN):  Developing  a  culture  of inclusivity

11.27 The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisions a future where every child, including Children with Special Needs (CwSN), feels valued, supported, and included. Recognising their unique potential, the NEP emphasises creating inclusive classrooms where  diversity  is  celebrated.  It  calls  for  barrier-free  infrastructure,  compassionate teacher training, and the integration of assistive technologies to ensure that CwSN can learn alongside their peers. The Samagra Shiksha scheme is in alignment with NEP 2020 and  Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPWD) Act 2016. Under Samagra Shiksha, dedicated funds have been allocated to support CwSN through aids and appliances, assistive devices, allowances, Braille materials, and therapeutic interventions including infrastructure  strengthening.  Infrastructure  improvements  include  ramps  in  11.35 lakh  schools,  handrails  in  7.7  lakh,  and  accessible  toilets  in  5.1  lakh  schools.  The Accessibility Code for Educational Institutions (2024) examines the physical barriers and information &amp; communication barriers of access to school facilities for CwSN.

11.28 Efforts  have  been  made  to  boost  CwSN  enrolment  at  all  levels,  with  notable increases  observed  in  secondary  and  higher  secondary  enrolments.  Although  the COVID-19  pandemic  caused  a  temporary  decline,  recovery  efforts  are  ongoing  to reintegrate out-of-school CwSN into formal education. According to the latest UDISE+ report (2023-24), 16.8 lakh CwSN are enrolled at the elementary level, 2.87 lakh at the secondary level, and 1.18 lakh are enrolled at the higher secondary level. 69 The various initiatives for CwSN are elaborated as below.

## Higher education

11.29 India's  higher  education  system  ranks  among  the  largest  globally,  with  4.33 crore students enrolled in 2021-22, a 26.5 per cent increase from 3.42 crore in 201415 70 . The GER for the 18-23 age group also increased from 23.7 per cent to 28.4 per cent during this same period (2014-15 to 2021-22). 71  To achieve the government's goal of increasing GER to 50 per cent by 2035 in higher education, there is a need to double the educational network and infrastructure.

11.30 Over the years, there has been a significant transformation in higher education, ecosystem. The number of Indian Institutes of Technology increased from 16 in 2014 to 23 in 2023, while Indian Institutes of Management grew from 13 in 2014 to 20 in 2023. 72 Similarly,  medical  colleges  experienced  remarkable  growth,  increasing  from 387 in 2013-14 to 780 in 2024-25. 73  Universities have also seen substantial expansion, rising from 723 in 2014 to 1,213 in 2024, registering a growth of 59.6 per cent. 74 Total Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) increased by 13.8 per cent from 51,534 in 201415 to 58,643 in 2022-23. 75

11.31   The NEP 2020 visualises a paradigm shift in the Indian higher education system through  a  restructured  system.  It  highlights  key  aspects  of  the  system  like  Multidisciplinary  and  Holistic  Education;  Research,  Innovation,  and  Entrepreneurship; Governance and Capacity Building of Teachers; Quality, Ranking, and Accreditation; Digital  Empowerment  and  Online  Education;  Equitable  and  Inclusive  Education; Promotion of Indian Languages and Indian Knowledge Systems; Skill Development and Employability and Internationalisation of Higher Education.

11.32 Importantly, the NEP envisages autonomy for institutions to innovate on these foundational aspects. It recognises that ' regulation of higher education has been too heavy-handed for decades… ' and that the ' regulatory system is in need of a complete overhaul in order to re-energise the higher education sector and enable it to thrive .' Towards this end, the NEP suggests several institutional reforms.  It asks that regulation must be `light but tight' aimed at financial probity and good governance.  Regulation must also ensure transparency of key aspects in the functioning of a university such as  finances,  procedures,  infrastructure,  and  faculty.  Hence  it  calls  for  accreditation of  institutions  based  on  basic  norms,  public  self-disclosure,  good  governance  and outcomes.

11.33 By 2040, all HEIs are to become multidisciplinary institutions. The measures  to  achieve  this  aim  include  greater  opportunities  for  outstanding  public education; scholarships by private/philanthropic universities for disadvantaged and underprivileged students; online education and Open Distance Learning (ODL); and all  infrastructure  and  learning  materials  accessible  and  available  to  learners  with disabilities. The policy calls for making 'India a global knowledge superpower.'

11.34 Effective  implementation  of  NEP  2020  requires  collaboration  across  the centre, states, UTs, HEIs, and regulatory bodies. The University Grants Commission (UGC) has introduced several initiatives like Guidelines for Multiple Entry and Exit in  Academic  Programmes,  Common  Universities  Entrance  Test,  Regulations  on Academic collaboration with foreign HEIs for Joint and Dual Degree Programmes, Guidelines for Professor of Practice, Guidelines on Pursuing two  Academic Programmes  simultaneously,  Guidelines  for  Internship/Apprenticeship  embedded Degree programme, Guidelines for Admission and Supernumerary seats of International Students in Undergraduate and Postgraduate Programmes in HEIs in India, Guidelines for the Establishment of Research and Development Cells in HEIs, Guidelines on Fostering Social Responsibility and Community Engagement in HEIs in India 2.0 etc.

11.35 India's higher education sector exhibits considerable multiplicity where several institutions  have  achieved  excellence,  and  many  others  are  aspiring  to  reach  that

standard. The challenges faced by the institutions vary, requiring tailored solutions. The regulatory framework (UGC/AICTE) currently includes over 50 regulations addressing different aspects of education and research. However, this approach does not fully align with the 'light but tight' regulatory model envisioned by the NEP. 76  For example, the UGC specifies minimum credits for various course categories (e.g., skill enhancement', `value-added') and prescribes the sequencing of courses over four years, aspects that could be entrusted to the institutions themselves.

11.36 Standardisation  of  key  parameters  and  consistency  of  programmes  across institutions is perhaps the objective of these regulations.  Achieving compliance with UGC norms may be an excellent way for institutions to achieve credibility in the eyes of prospective students, faculty, and employees.  On the other hand, such compliance is not essential for quality institutions.  These have already achieved strong reputations in teaching, research, and placement of their students.  These institutions have innovated on some dimensions of their functioning, and they should be encouraged to follow that path since that is the only way to compete with global institutions.

11.37 It  should  be  explicitly  stated  that  compliance  with  regulations  beyond  the minimum accreditation requirements (proposed in NEP) is voluntary. Such compliance will be desired by institutions wishing to signal their capability and credibility.

11.38 Institutions that desire to stand by their own hard-won reputations should be free to carve out their own path.  There is no greater accountability than that demanded by the market through prospective faculty, students, their parents, and collaborating academic  and  non-academic  institutions.  In  the  spirit  of  good  governance  and transparency, these institutions should be required to publicise prominently that they are not complaint-certified by the regulator.  It is important to embrace diversity and to trust the genius of faculty and students to come up with frameworks that are novel, creative, and impactful on society.

11.39 Further,  there  is  an  increasing  focus  on  strengthening  the  ecosystem  for professional/technical streams of education such as medicine. Emphasis on regulatory reform and enhancement of standards is being made. Box XI.8 discusses the medical education landscape's challenges and measures taken to address them.

## Box XI.8: Challenges to medical education and action

The medical education ecosystem in the country has made significant strides, with notable achievements that lay a strong foundation for future growth. However, there are exciting opportunities to further enhance the system and ensure it fully aligns with broader policy objectives. While the regulatory framework has made progress, there is an opportunity to evolve and keep pace with the dynamic needs of the healthcare sector.

The  number  of  candidates  aspiring  to  study  MBBS  has  increased  consistently  over  the years, from around 16 lakh in 2019 to around 24 lakh in 2024. 77  The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test - Under Graduate (NEET-UG) is the single mode of entry through which students enter into medical education, MBBS courses in India and abroad. There has been a sustained increase in the number of opportunities available for medical education in the previous ten years. Since FY19, the number of medical colleges grew from 499 to 648 in FY23 to 780 in FY25, during which time the MBBS seats increased from 70,012 to 96,077 in FY23 to 1,18,137 in FY25 and post graduate seats increased from 39,583 to 64,059 in FY23 78 to 73,157 in FY25.

There are 13.86 lakh practitioners of modern medicine registered as of July, 2024, 79 which converts into current availability  for  the  whole  population  of  the  country  in  the  ratio  of 1:1263. 80 The  WHO  standard  norm  of  1:1000  seems  to  be  attainable  by  2030  with  a conservative 50,000 doctors being licensed every year till 2030. Thus, numerical shortage of physician availability in India is perhaps no longer a primary concern. However, there are some larger concerns warranting attention. These are discussed below.

## The issue of affordability

Unlike other professional education streams, fees for medical education is highly regulated. In case of government medical colleges, the respective state governments are responsible for fixation of fees. In the case of private unaided medical colleges, the fee structure is decided by  a  committee  set  up  by  the  respective  state  government  under  the  chairmanship  of  a retired High Court Judge in pursuance of the directions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India. 81 The National Medical Commission (NMC) has issued guidelines for determination of fees and all other charges in respect of 50 per cent of seats in private medical institutions and deemed to be universities. Despite such measures, fees remain high - at ₹60 lakh to one crore or more 82  in the private sector which holds 48 per cent of MBBS seats. This highlights the opportunity to make medical education more accessible and affordable for all, particularly

for  those  from  less  privileged  backgrounds.  By  reducing  the  cost  of  medical  education, we can contribute to lowering healthcare service costs. If universal coverage is the goal, prioritising cost and equity in medical education will be key to achieving it.

The consequence is that every year thousands of students go abroad to around 50 countries especially those with lower fees such as China, Russia, Ukraine, Philippines, Bangladesh. 83 Medical  education  abroad  entails  hardships  of  studying  abroad  and  productive  years  of youth invested in repeated attempts at exams - the NEET-UG before taking admission, the Foreign Medical Graduates (FMG) Exam 84 on  completing  the  course  and  then  complete compulsory internships of 12 months in India.

FMGs in China (during COVID lockdowns) and Ukraine (as the conflict escalated), had to return  to  India  dropping  their  education  and  faced  uncertain  prospect.  The  subsequent regulatory issues in addressing the difficulties faced by FMGs and the need to maintain standards  in  allowing  them  to  practice  in  India  has  been  a  challenge  and  has  required interventions  of  the  courts  in  more  than  one  occasion.  The  very  low  pass  percentage  of FMGs in the qualifying exam (16.65 per cent in 2023 85 ) indicates sub-par quality of medical education  abroad  including  lack  of  clinical  training.  As  policy  intervention  to  dissuade medical  education  abroad  is  crafted,  keeping  costs  is  India  within  reasonable  limits  is essential.

## Geographical reach

The availability of opportunities for medical education appears to be geographically skewed, apparent from the fact that 51 per cent of undergraduate seats and 49 per cent of postgraduate seats are in the southern states. 86 Further, the availability is skewed in favour of urban areas with the urban to rural doctor density ratio being 3.8:1. 87 These patterns tend to follow the pattern in availability of healthcare services in general. It has been estimated that 75 per cent of dispensaries and 60 per cent of hospitals are in urban areas, where 80 per cent of doctors serve. 88 The imbalance in distribution can be attributed to the state/region level of economic development, demand for and expansion of healthcare services, and increasing market for medical value travel.

The growth in the number of medical practitioners offers a prospect to improve the distribution of healthcare professionals across regions. While many graduates and specialists prefer to practice in their home states or in major cities due to better amenities and professional opportunities, this presents a chance to enhance healthcare access in rural and underserved

Students may require anywhere between a minimum of 8-10 years to become eligible to obtain the license to practice.

areas. By offering incentives, improving infrastructure, and fostering professional growth in these regions, we can attract and retain healthcare professionals, ensuring a more balanced and equitable distribution of doctors to strengthen public healthcare services nationwide.

## Specialisations

There  is  also  a  skewed  distribution  of  seats  in  favour  of  specialisations  like  radiology, dermatology, gynaecology, cardiology while specialities like psychiatry, geriatrics etc., are neglected. The current shortage of specialists across specialities will further aggravate in streams that are currently not preferred but will be required in the future. Demand for post graduate  education  is  not  restricted  by  the  need  for  clinical  practitioners,  these  doctors form  the  resource  pool  for  research  and  development  in  advanced  fields  of  medicine, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology etc. They are also crucial as faculty and trainers of the next generation.  While we focus on increasing facilities for specialisations it is also necessary to maintain distribution across geographies and streams. 89

## Remuneration

Market estimates indicate that remuneration of fresh graduates is around ₹ 5 lakh and senior doctors earn between ₹12.5 -18.4 lakh per annum in cities. 90 This is almost similar or lower to the packages that are available to other graduates at the entry level. The attraction towards the medical profession, as seen from the consistently increasing number of aspirants, seems to arise more from the social status attached to it rather than its earning potential. This may mean that the availability of meaningful work and commensurate remuneration may reduce with increase in the number of doctors available in the future. This would reinforce the  already  occurring  migration of doctors from India into greener pastures. The OECD countries reported in 2021 that there were close to 19,000 physicians from India in their workforce and migration in 2021 alone was over 2800 physicians. Increased public and private  sector  investments  into  medical  education  is  in  effect  creating  a  global  health workforce. The trends in migration need to be factored while incentives for service in public health system are calibrated to ensure availability of doctors in rural areas.

## Other issues

Quality of education is directly related to the availability of qualified and experienced faculty and the clinical exposure at the hospital. Regulatory requirements in terms of both are robust. Non-compliance  carries  penalties  including  the  cancellation  of  recognition  of  courses. The NMC is empowered to monitor and penalise such non-compliance. Measures such as CCTV cameras and an Aadhaar based attendance system which are centrally monitored by the national regulator have been put in place. The granularity of regulations may appear necessary given that medical profession deserves to be of the highest quality possible but also seem overbearing in terms of associated compliance and monitoring costs. Despite the

90 https://tinyurl.com/5573epev.

elaborate  regulations  and  monitoring,  issues  like  shortage  of  faculty,  ghost  faculty,  low patient load in hospitals etc., continue to affect the quality of training. There may be need to revisit the incentive-disincentive and design of regulatory measures to improve compliance, reduce costs and prevent associated rent-seeking.

The success of any policy, including regulatory ones, lies in its execution. If outcomes do not align with our goals or if there are unexpected effects, it is essential to take a step back and refine these policies to make them more meaningful and impactful.

## Conclusion

To address the uneven distribution of seats and to expand the availability of seats, the central government is supporting the states through three centrally sponsored schemes, viz., the construction of new medical colleges, creation of infrastructure for expansion of MBBS and post graduate seats. 91 The regulatory reform process started with the setting up of the NMC in 2019. NMC has since brought into effect broad based regulations specifying minimum standards for establishment of colleges, increasing number of seats, opening new courses, introduction of  a  competency-based  curriculum,  minimum qualification, and training of teachers etc. In collaboration with the Quality Council of India, a rating and accreditation system for medical colleges has also been proposed.

With all these efforts being made and the private sector remaining an active participant, the medical education landscape presents large opportunities for the future and presents a bigger challenge to policymakers than any other field of professional education does.

## TOWARDS A HEALTHY NATION

11.40 Health  is  a  crucial  component  of  human  capital  and  a  valuable  asset  for  a prosperous  and  stable  economy.  It  boosts  productivity,  reduces  healthcare  needs, enhances life expectancy, and supports social development. Furthermore, good health is  foundational for the young generation to achieve their aspirations and contribute to society. The emphasis on health is important given that India is emerging into an economic powerhouse driven by its youthful population. Through concerted efforts by individuals, communities, and policy interventions, a robust and healthy generation of adults can be raised. Government initiatives, including preventive measures, universal access  to  high-quality  healthcare,  strengthened  public  health  infrastructure,  and advancements in medical education, have collectively contributed to making healthcare in India more accessible and affordable for all.

An increase in the share of capital expenditure in THE from 6.3 per cent in FY16 to 12.7 per cent in FY22 is a positive sign as it will lead to broader and better health infrastructure.

11.44 Government  health  insurance  schemes  constitute  a  5.87  per  cent  share  in healthcare financing schemes, out of which social insurance schemes like Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) 98 , Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) 99 , and Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) 100  have a 3.24 per cent share. Government-supported voluntary insurance schemes like Ayushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY), Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), state-specific government health insurance schemes, etc., have a 2.63 per cent share in healthcare financing schemes.

11.45 The increase in government spending on health has an important implication for the reduction of financial hardship endured by households. In the THE of the country between FY15 and FY22, the share of GHE 101 has increased from 29.0 per cent to 48.0

## Transforming healthcare for tomorrow

11.50 Healthcare  infrastructure  is  essential  to  a  functioning  healthcare  system, ensuring access to quality medical services and promoting public health. This includes hospitals,  clinics,  healthcare  professionals,  medical  institutions,  health  centres,  and information technology systems that work collaboratively to provide care.

11.51    Over  the  past  few  decades,  India  has  made  significant  progress  in  health infrastructure,  driven  by  advancements  in  medical  technology  and  expanded  public health programmes. Initiatives like Ayushman Bharat (AB), the PM-Ayushman Bharat

Health  Infrastructure  Mission  (PM-ABHIM),  and  the  Free  Drugs  Service  Initiative (FDSI)  have  transformed  healthcare  delivery.  The  progress  made  in  public  health infrastructure follows.

106  Over 1,75,560 Ayushman Arogya Mandir (AAM) have been operationalised till 31 December 2024.

11.54 FDSI  (2015): To  reduce  OOPE  for  patients  at  public  health  facilities,  the government  launched  the  FDSI  under  the  National  Health  Mission  (NHM).  This provides financial support to states/UTs for ensuring the availability of essential drugs: 106 drugs at SHCs, 172 drugs at PHCs, 300 drugs at CHCs, 318 drugs at Sub-District Hospitals (SDHs), and 381 drugs at district hospitals. The FDSI ensures drug quality by procuring only from Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certified manufacturers and conducting mandatory post-supply testing of medicines at the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL)-accredited laboratories before distribution.

11.55 Commitment to universal vaccine coverage and health equity: The Universal  Immunisation  Programme  (UIP)  is  one  of  India's  most  impactful  public health initiatives, providing life-saving vaccines to millions of newborns and pregnant women annually. Launched as the Expanded Programme on Immunisation in 1978, it was rebranded as UIP in 1985, extending coverage from urban to rural areas to bridge healthcare disparities.

11.56 Currently, the UIP offers 11 vaccines free of cost, protecting against 12 vaccinepreventable  diseases.  A  child  who  has  received  Bacille  Calmette  Guerin  (BCG), three doses of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), three doses of Pentavalent and one dose of Measles Rubella (MR) by the first year of age is called a fully immunised child. With full immunisation coverage for FY24 at 93.5 per cent nationally, the UIP continues to safeguard public health and ensure equitable access to essential vaccines.

11.57 The Jan Aushadhi scheme ,  launched to provide affordable medicines, has gained significant momentum, achieving record sales in 2024 and expanding to over 14,000 kendras nationwide. 107  Despite challenges like quality concerns, supply issues, and thin profit margins for pharmacists, the scheme has improved access to low-cost drugs. Awareness campaigns, expanded product offerings like sanitary napkins, and increased rural outreach have boosted its impact, particularly for low-income groups and those  with  chronic  illnesses.  For  example,  Jan  Aushadhi  distributors  in  Kerala reported expecting significant year-on-year turnover growth, driven by the addition of  new  Jan  Aushadhi  Kendra,  expanded  product  offerings,  and  awareness  camps initiated under Pharmaceuticals &amp; Medical Devices Bureau of India and Department of Pharmaceuticals directives. 108 While profitability remains a hurdle for pharmacists and suppliers,  the  growing  demand  by  consumers  highlights  the  enduring  need  for affordable healthcare solutions.

## Disruptive technology providing seamless and equitable healthcare.

11.58 Technology  integration  in  healthcare  delivery  ranges  from  the  utilisation  of wearable devices for timely diagnoses and recommendations of personalised treatments to telehealth technologies that connect patients and health professionals in a virtual space, all aiming to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Public health professionals now have numerous opportunities to implement innovative public health technology solutions to enhance patient care significantly. Some of the initiatives of the MoHFW for the integration of technologies are discussed in this section.

11.59 U-WIN: The U-WIN  portal 109 marks a transformative step in India's immunisation efforts, digitising vaccination records for pregnant women and children up  to  16  years  under  the  UIP.  This  user-friendly  platform  enables  seamless  access to  immunisation  records,  flexible  scheduling,  and  'Anytime  Access'  and  'Anywhere' vaccination.  Beneficiaries  can  self-register  via  the  web  portal  or  mobile  app,  track schedules,  and  receive  SMS  reminders  for  upcoming  doses.  U-WIN  also  generates QR-based e-vaccination certificates and facilitates the creation of Ayushman Bharat Health Accounts (ABHA) for parents and children, supporting holistic digital health management. The portal is accessible in 11 regional languages. 110 Over 1.7 crore pregnant women and 5.4 crore children are registered digitally and tracked more than 26.4 crore vaccine doses in real-time. 111

11.60 E-Sanjeevani: E-Sanjeevani - the National Telemedicine Service, has emerged as  the  world's  largest  telemedicine  implementation  in  primary  healthcare.  It  has served over 31.19 crore patients through 1.29 lakh AAM as spokes, which are served by 16,447 hubs and 676 online OPDs with support of more than 225,286 doctors, medical specialists, super-specialists and health workers (Figures are as on 12 November 2024).

11.61 Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM): Launched in September 2021 with the aim of creating a national digital health ecosystem, it supports universal health coverage and is the necessary backbone for an integrated digital health infrastructure in the country.

11.62 The integration and use of technology have the potential to offer viable solutions to problems of quality, accessibility, and affordability. One such example is the potential to prevent loss of lives and save time by leveraging drones for the delivery of medicines in difficult geographies and in times of emergencies ( Box XI.9 ).

## Box XI.9: Aerial angels: Changing the healthcare landscape

Drones  are  transforming  healthcare  in  India  by  ensuring  rapid  delivery  of  life-saving medicines and collecting samples from remote and inaccessible areas, proving indispensable during emergencies. Their ability to navigate diverse terrains, such as roads, water bodies, forests,  and  high-rise  buildings,  makes  them  highly  effective  and  reliable  in  the  most challenging conditions making it crucial in emergencies, potentially preventing the loss of lives.

The WEF launched the project 'Medicines from the Sky' in collaboration with the government of Telangana in September 2021 in the Vikarabad district in Telangana. This programme was the first of its kind in Asia to deliver medicines and jabs to test the feasibility of mediumrange delivery options. 112  Later, in 2022, the project was carried out in Arunachal Pradesh with the aim of analysing the response of the state's healthcare system when integrated with drones. As of October 2024, the key progress highlights for Arunachal Pradesh 113  are:

It was observed that the delivery times had drastically improved, with trips reduced from eight hours by ground transport to just 22 minutes by drone, cutting emergency response times and saving lives in critical situations. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recognised the project's achievements for its innovative use of drones to enhance health supply chains in the region.

The project 'i-DRONE' (ICMR's Drone Response and Outreach for North East) was launched under the aegis of the MoHFW in October 2021 with the view to assess the feasibility of using drones to deliver vaccines and medical supplies. The exercise was conducted in rugged geographical  terrains  of  the  northeast  (Manipur  and  Nagaland),  including  land,  islands, foothills and across the hills. 114 Following the study's success, this initiative has been expanded and it now includes delivering medical essentials at high altitudes in Himachal Pradesh, transporting TB samples in Telangana, and moving pathological samples in Karnataka. 115

Drones  have  significant  potential  to  deliver  essential  goods  to  vulnerable  populations, helping to overcome access barriers and facilitating faster delivery of lifesaving medicines.

## Advancing healthcare through AI

11.63 The  National  Strategy  for  Artificial  Intelligence  (2018)  developed  by  NITI Aayog  discussed  how  AI  could  help  address  the  challenges  of  quality,  accessibility, and affordability for a large section of the population. The strategy emphasised how AI combined with robotics and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can potentially become  the  'new  nervous  system  for  healthcare',  providing  solutions  to  address healthcare problems and helping the government achieve universal health for all. 117

11.64 As per NASSCOM, the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare can create new opportunities for the sector and bridge the accessibility, affordability, and quality gaps. 118 Adoption of AI can help reduce drug discovery and delivery costs; it can improve the quality of medical devices, improve diagnosis accuracy and enable real-time monitoring of remote patients. For healthcare providers, AI helps streamline the overall patient journey, assists clinicians in reducing misdiagnoses, and  enables personalised treatments and preventive care. One of the use case examples of how AI can efficiently deliver services and enhance the accessibility of healthcare for citizens are presented in Box XI.10 .

## Box XI.10: Use of Tele-Radiology and AI in silicosis management

Silicosis is a debilitating lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust. It is associated with severe comorbidities such as tuberculosis, cancer, ischemic heart disease, bronchitis, and infections from bacteria and fungi.

The Rajasthan state government has set a new benchmark in public health management of this disease, which is widespread in the state due to sandstone mining activities. 119 The state  government  is  effectively  using  digital  X-rays,  tele-radiology,  and  AI  to  streamline the  diagnosis  of  Silicosis.  The  technology  was  developed  by  training  an  AI  model  on  a vast  dataset  of  over-labelled  chest  X-rays.  By  leveraging  AI  technology,  the  government enabled the automatic detection of the disease, making the diagnostic process faster and more accurate. This technology has significantly improved the identification and treatment of  Silicosis  patients.  The  government  also  introduced  DBT  self-approval  portal,  which allows diagnosed patients to receive financial assistance directly into their bank accounts, bypassing the previously cumbersome administrative procedures. 120  This system ensures that those affected by Silicosis receive timely relief.

11.65 Another example of technology integration in health care is the eSwasthya Dham portal 121  launched by the Uttarakhand Government. 122  The portal helps monitor the Char Dham Yatra pilgrim's (Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath-together called as the Char Dham Yatra) health parameters and offers a variety of benefits for pilgrims, including the ability to generate an ABHA in under two minutes. Creating the ABHA, helps provide a reliable and secure identity for devotees, enabling them to manage their health records digitally. This system will also ensure prompt assistance for citizens in case of emergencies. As a result, it facilitates the smooth journey of pilgrims.

11.66 Despite its  great  potential,  AI  adoption  in  India  is  still  in  its  early  stages.  In 2023, 34 per cent of healthcare organisations in India were piloting AI projects, and 16 per cent had moved their generative AI initiatives into production. However, the adoption  of  AI  in  the  Indian  healthcare  sector  faces  several  challenges,  including  a lack of specialised talent (both technical and domain-specific), data complexities, and difficulties in scaling up. 123  This requires attention going forward.

## The Impact of lifestyle and work culture on mental well-being

11.67 Mental well-being is often conflated with happiness or mood.  However, it is beyond that. It is  the  ability  to  navigate  life's  challenges  and  function  productively.

123 ibid note 118 above

Mental  well-being  encompasses  all  our  mental-emotional,  social,  cognitive,  and physical capabilities. This can also be construed as the mind's composite health.

11.68  The Economic Survey 2023-24 recognised mental well-being as an economic issue and highlighted, in some detail, the increasing prevalence of mental health issues worldwide and in India and its likely impact on the economy. It emphasised a whole of community approach to tackling mental health problems. In this Survey, we take the discussion forward.

11.69  Data suggests that mental well-being is not static; indeed, there are a myriad of factors, including workplace culture, hours spent working, and lifestyle, that influence mental  well-being.  This  section  presents  the  results  of  a  short  survey  conducted  to understand how lifestyle, work culture, family bonds, eating habits, etc., are affecting the  mental  health  of  citizens  in  the  country.  Although  a  few  prior  surveys  have been conducted to assess mental health in India 124 , they do not allow us to have this understanding. 125

11.70 Since 2021, the Sapien Labs Centre for Human Brain and Mind (the Centre), India 126 ,  has  been  collecting data on a comprehensive measure of mental well-being from over 150,000 internet-enabled individuals in India. The data is dynamic; each month, an additional sample of about 2,000-3,000 individuals residing in India gets added to the database. In the months of October and November of 2024, a special survey  focused  on  understanding  the  impact  of  work  culture,  family  bonds,  eating habits, pastimes, and exercise on mental well-being and productivity was conducted by the Centre. This survey was conducted online on 5,233 digitally-enabled individuals between 18-64 years of age. 127

11.71   The Centre uses a comprehensive measure of mental well-being that explicitly accounts for an individual's ability to function and is not based on a symptom-based assessment that has been widely used previously. The measurement utilises the MHQ or  Mental Health Quotient assessment that evaluates 47 aspects of mental function spanning six dimensions (Chart XI.9.a) .  These aspects include both mental health

11.72 Work  culture  comprises  the  myriad  of  factors  that  define  an  individual's experience at work, including work amount/load, manager and peer relationships, and perceived control. Global data 131 , mirrored in India, suggests that work culture strongly impacts mental well-being. In the survey, workers employed in the formal economy in India were asked to rate various work factors on a scale from 1 to 9, where one was the worst, and nine was the best.

11.73 Individuals with the best manager and colleague relationships report a 100-point higher  (or  33  per  cent 132 )  mental  well-being  score  compared  to  their  counterparts working  with  the  worst  manager/peer  relationships.  Similarly,  those  reporting  the best  workload report 80 points or 27 per cent greater mental well-being than their counterparts with the worst workload.

11.74 Further,  individuals  who  report  the  best  pride  and  purpose  at  work  have  a 100-point greater mental well-being score (0r 33 per cent) and a 120-point (40 per cent) greater well-being score than those who report the worst. In addition, individuals in  fully  remote  work  situations  have  a  mental  well-being  score  about  50  points (17 per cent) lower than counterparts in either fully in-person or hybrid work models, suggesting that social interaction at work is essential to preserve mental well-being.

11.75 While the hours spent at work are informally considered a measure of productivity, a previous study has documented adverse health effects when hours exceed 55-60 per week. 133  Spending long hours at one's desk is equally detrimental to mental well-being. Individuals who spend 12 or more hours at a desk have distressed/struggling levels of mental well-being, with a mental well-being score approximately 100 points lower than those who spend less than or equal to two hours at a desk, according to the survey.

11.76   While promoting a better workplace culture will lead to better mental well-being, lifestyle choices and family situations also play a significant role. Results of the survey show that individuals who rarely consume ultra-processed or packaged junk food have better  mental  well-being  than  those  who  regularly  do.    Similarly,  those  who  rarely exercise, spend their free time on social media or are not close to their families have worse mental well-being. (Chart XI.10)

132 Since  MHQ  is  calculated  on  a  300-point  scale  (-100  to  +200),  a  100  point  higher  score  translates  into  a (100/300)*100=33 percent.

## Chart XI.10 Mental Well-Being and Lifestyle

<!-- image -->

11.77  While the low levels of mental well-being are worrying, the ramifications of these trends on the economy are equally disturbing. Chart XI.11 shows that individuals with well-being scores between -100 and -50 are unable to work about 15 days a month, while those with scores between 100 and 150 are unable to work three days a month, and those with scores about 150 are unable to work only two days a month.  In addition to impacting mental well-being and lifestyle, the workplace culture also affects productivity.

11.78 The  survey  results  show  the  extent  to  which  lifestyle  choices  and  workplace culture are associated with the number of days an individual is unable to work/month. 134 Better lifestyle choices/workplace cultures and family relationships are associated with 2-3 fewer days lost per month at work. Having poor relationships with managers and low (worst) pride and purpose at work are associated with the largest increases in the number of days one is unable to work. The findings also suggest that multiple factors affect productivity. For example, even in jobs with the best managerial relationships, about 5 days per month are lost. This is because workplace culture is but one factor (among several) in the determination of productivity (and mental well-being). A study 135 by the WHO finds that globally, about 12 billion days are lost annually due to depression and anxiety, amounting to a financial loss of $1 trillion. In rupee terms, this translates to about ₹7,000 per day.

134  Self-reported measure of productivity is used.

11.79 Lifestyle choices and workplace culture are critical for mental well-being and, hence,  productivity.  If  India's  economic  ambitions  are  to  be  met,  then  immediate attention  must  be  given  to  lifestyle  choices  that  are  often  made  during  childhood/ youth. 136  Furthermore, hostile work cultures and excessive hours spent working at the desk can adversely affect mental well-being and ultimately put the brakes on the pace of economic growth. 137

11.80   The increase in mental health issues in children and adolescents is often linked to the overuse of the internet and, specifically, social media. Jonathan Haidt, in his book ' The Anxious Generation: How the great rewiring of children is causing an epidemic of mental illness ', which has now been voted as the book of the year by Goodreads, 138 provides a researched assessment of adolescent mental health. He suggests that the arrival of the 'phone-based childhood' is rewiring the very experience of growing up. The recent announcements by government of Australia to ban the use of social media by children below 16 years of age is a testimony to the gravity of the situation. Similar interventions are being discussed in Sweden and Spain, as per news report. 139

11.81   While these interventions at government level are being contemplated, there is an urgent need for school and family-level interventions to encourage healthy pastimes (meeting with friends, playing outside). Investing time in building close family bonds would go a long way towards keeping children and adolescents away from internet and

137    A caveat to these findings is that the data used here is only from the digitally-enabled population. Google and Facebook ads were used to recruit respondents to take the MHQ survey.  It is therefore possible that the data are skewed towards those for whom mental health is a problem who took the survey to know their mental wellbeing score. However, this worry is not completely justified since the sample also includes individuals with good mental health scores- over 30 per cent report MHQ scores 100 or higher placing them in the succeeding/ thriving  range.  Finally,  the  associations  shown  here-of  lifestyle  and  work  culture  on  mental  well-being  and productivity cannot strictly be interpreted as a causal effect.

improving mental well-being. In many ways, returning to our roots may allow us to reach further for the skies in terms of mental health.

11.82 In summary, given the direct costs to human welfare and the spirit and sentiment of the nation, putting mental well-being at the centre of the economic agenda is prudent. The scale of the problem is immense as discussed in the Economic Survey 2023-24 (Chapter 7, para 7.28). Post-facto treatment will not be sufficient. It is about time to find  viable,  impactful  preventive  strategies  and  interventions.  India's  demographic dividend is riding on skills, education, physical health and, above all, mental health of its youth.

11.83 Recognising this, the government is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive mental health ecosystem. The Economic Survey 2023-24 (Chapter 7, Table VII.3)  highlighted  various  initiatives  aimed  at  addressing  mental  health  and  wellbeing.  The  National  Mental  Health  Policy,  2014  provides  an  overarching  vision  for mental health in the country. The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 lays down a rights-based framework for accessible and dignified mental health services. Currently, 47 Mental Health  Institutes  are  operational  across  the  country.  Additionally,  the  government supports mental health services at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels under the National Mental Health Program. A dedicated Tele-MANAS Cell at the Armed Forces Medical  College,  Pune,  supports  Armed  Forces  personnel  and  their  dependents. The  Tele-MANAS  Mobile  Application,  launched  on  10  October  2024,  provides  a comprehensive mental health mobile platform. Additionally, video consultations on Tele MANAS have been initially rolled out in Karnataka, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and Tamil Nadu and will be scaled nationwide.

## Impact of lifestyle choices on health

11.84 An individual's lifestyle, encompassing habits like diet, sleep, device use, and exercise, profoundly impacts overall well-being.  This section discusses the crucial role of lifestyle on an individual's health.

11.85 According to WHO, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the reason behind the death of 41 million people each year, equivalent to 74 per cent of all deaths globally. Of all NCD deaths, 77 per cent are in low- and middle-income countries. 140  The burden of NCD risk factors arises partly from population growth and ageing.

11.86 According to the 2017 study report 'India: Health of the Nation's States' by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the proportion of deaths due to NCDs in India increased from 37.9 per cent in 1990 to 61.8 per cent in 2016. The four major NCDs are cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), and

diabetes. These diseases share four common behavioural risk factors: unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption. 141

11.87 Recognising the growing NCD challenge, the MoHFW launched the National Programme  for  Prevention  and  Control  of  NCD  (NP-NCD),  the  erstwhile  National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, and  Stroke  (NPCDCS).  The  programme  has  significantly  strengthened  healthcare infrastructure,  decentralising  services  and  ensuring  quality  care  reaches  rural  and remote areas.

11.88 Population-Based  Screening  (PBS)  initiative: To  enhance  early  NCD detection, the government launched the PBS initiative targeting individuals aged 30 and above for screening for common NCDs. The National NCD portal 142 , introduced in 2018, manages patient data and integrates health records with ABHA IDs. As on date, 42.2 crore individuals enrolled (aged more than 30 years), and 39.80 crore individuals were  screened  for  diabetes,  hypertension,  and  common  cancers,  enabling  timely interventions, and reducing long-term healthcare burdens.

11.89 Among other factors, lifestyle choices play a crucial role in the prevention of NCDs. 143   Reducing  excess  calorie  intake  and  improving  dietary  quality  may  help prevent many primary and secondary cardiovascular events. 144  The section on mental well-being discussed how the intake of ultra-processed food (UPFs) is associated with mental well-being. Box XI.11 dwells on the impact of intake of UPF on the physical health of an individual.

## Box XI.11: Ultra-processed food and health impacts

From  sweetened  breakfast  cereals,  soft  drinks,  and  energy  drinks  to  fried  chicken  and packaged cookies, UPFs have undeniably marked their formidable presence in everyday

diet. The NOVA food classification system 145 , 146  categorises UPFs broadly as ready-to-eat products characterised as industrial formulations composed of substances extracted from food, along with additives for taste enhancement. These foods are generally energy-rich with high levels of sugar, salt and unsaturated fats and are nutrient deficient as they are made from ingredients derived from a limited variety of crops such as wheat or soy.

The National Dietary Guideline 2024 147  identifies UPFs as food and beverage products that have  undergone extensive  industrial  processing  and  contain  a  high  number  of  additives such as preservatives, sweeteners, emulsifiers, and other substances that are not commonly used in culinary preparations.

Convenience, hyper palatability, affordability, longer shelf life and vigorous advertising and marketing strategies have made a conducive environment for the thriving business of UPFs in India. WHO India 148 , reports that, between 2011 and 2021, the value of retail sales in the UPF segment grew at a CAGR of 13.7 per cent. Though there was a YoY growth rate decline from 12.7 per cent to 5.5 per cent during 2020, the very next year, it was 11.29 per cent. According to the HCES 2022-23, almost 9.6 per cent of the food budget in rural areas and 10.64 per cent in urban areas is spent on beverages, refreshments, and processed food. 149

There is enough research to show that the shift in dietary practices from unprocessed to semi-processed and to UPF items exposes an individual to a wide range of adverse health outcomes ranging from obesity, chronic inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and mental disorders. 150,151,152  Being lower in fibre content, UPFs are observed to lead to weight gain and obesity in adults and children. 153,154,155  Studies from across countries show a

146    NOVA Food Classification system, which was designed by Center for Epidemiological Studies in Health and Nutrition, School of Public Health, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. NOVA helps people 'group foods according to the extent and purpose of the processing they undergo. The NOVA system classifies foods into four categories: (i) NOVA1 includes unprocessed or minimally processed foods, (ii) NOVA2 comprises culinary ingredients (iii) NOVA3 covers processed foods, and (iv) NOVA4 includes ultra-processed foods.

direct association between exposure to UPFs and 32 health parameters spanning mortality, cancer,  and  mental,  respiratory,  cardiovascular,  gastrointestinal,  and  metabolic  health outcomes.  They  also  indicate  that  greater  exposure  to  UPFs  leads  to  anxiety  outcomes, mental disorder outcomes, prevalent adverse sleep-related outcomes, heart disease-related mortality, type 2 diabetes, depressive outcomes, wheezing, obesity, and cancer and higher risks  of  mortality. 156,157 Further,  there  are  also  evidences  that  UPFs  may  hamper  with immunity and may lead to increasing gut impermeability and can cause bacterial imbalance in the gut, with adverse implications to immunity. 158 Increased and frequent  consumption of UPF is associated with an increased risk of multimorbidity, which refers to the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions due to non-communicable diseases for an extended period of time. 159

Historically,  the  correlation  between  poor  dietary  intake  and  adverse  mental  health  has been documented. There is growing evidence that the level of food processing influences dietary  quality  and  impacts  mental  health. 160 Studies  also  substantiate  that  increased consumption  of  UPF  has  an  adverse  impact  on  the  mental  well-being  of  children  and adolescents. 161  Multiple studies link highly processed food with low mood, depression, and anxiety. Increased frequency of intake of UPF impacts mental health function, including cognition, adaptability, and resilience. Also, they can lead to depression, anxiety, and longterm psychological distress. 162,163

India has made strides in addressing its growing disease burden as a result of UPF through notable interventions such as Advertising and Claims Regulations, 2018; School Children Regulation, 2020; and the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2020. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 addresses the issue of lack of a clear definition of  misleading  advertisement and prescribes fines for such advertising of unhealthy food products.

To date, much of the policy and public messaging about 'unhealthy food' or the regulations have focused on specific nutrients-saturated fats, sodium, and sugar.

## The Way Forward

The huge business of UPF segments has been built on hyper palatability of food items and marketing strategies involving misleading advertisements and celebrity endorsements targeting consumer behaviour. Often unhealthy packaged food items are advertised and marketed as healthy products. For example, breakfast cereals, tetra pack juices and chocolate malt drinks, often advertised as healthy and nutritious, come under the category of UPF based on their ingredients. Misleading nutrition claims and information on UPFs need to be tackled and should be brought under the scanner. Setting standards for permissible levels of salt and sugar and ensuring checks for UPF brands to adhere to the regulations are also required.

Many countries, including Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Mexico, Israel, Peru, the UK and Uruguay, have been implementing the Nutrient Profile Model for labelling and restricting marketing as proposed by the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) in 2016. In 2011, Denmark introduced a tax on saturated food products. 164  Mexico has imposed a surcharge on carbonated drinks and a tax on junk food. 165

Making consumers conscious about what they eat, its ingredients and associated side effects is important not only to counter the intake of UPF but also to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Understanding the ingredients of packaged food, the ill effects of UPF, and healthy food choices should be a part of the school curriculum. Since UPF brands often target children and adolescents, massive awareness of the potential risk factors of UPF is of utmost necessity. Generating health-conscious consumers can further motivate and incentivise various UPF brands to come up with healthy alternatives or minimise the extent of the negative effects of  the  UPFs. This calls forth for enormous behaviour change campaigns and awarenessgenerating sessions. Efforts also need to be directed to promote local and seasonal fruits and vegetables and facilitate positive subsidies for healthy foods such as whole foods, millet, fruits, and vegetables to improve their availability, affordability, and consumption.

A study by Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest (NAPi)/Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI) 2023 recommended that efforts to curb the harmful impact of UPFs should be free from food industry influence. The MoHFW should urgently define nutrient thresholds for  sugars,  salt,  and  saturated  fats  to  regulate  advertising,  adopt  warning  front-of-pack labels  (FOPL),  and  impose  stricter  marketing  restrictions  on  unhealthy  foods,  especially targeting children under 18. Schools, hospitals, and public areas should eliminate UPFs, while incentives should promote affordable healthy food production. High GST rates and amendments to consumer protection laws could deter misleading advertising. Additionally, a coalition of civil society and government entities, free from conflicts of interest, is vital to educate the public and counter food industry interference. 166

The government has been making dedicated efforts to promote healthy foods and an active lifestyle by implementing initiatives such as Eat Right India 167  and Fit India Movement. 168 By prioritising whole, minimally processed foods rich in nutrients, fibre, and essential vitamins, individuals can lower their consumption of unhealthy additives, excess sugar, and refined grains often found in processed foods. This proactive shift not only enhances physical health but also supports mental clarity and sustained energy.

A multi-pronged approach would be required to address the concerns emerging from the increased inclusion of UPFs in diets in India. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of  India  (FSSAI)  could  consider  bringing  UPFs  under  regulation  with  a  clear  definition and standards, including stricter labelling requirements. Improved monitoring of branded products to ensure compliance would help build consumer confidence. A 22-country study established  that  self-regulation  has  not  been  very  effective  in  this  regard. 169 ,170 Further, consumer protection  efforts  can  be  strengthened  to  deal  with  aggressive  marketing  and distribution practices and misleading nutrition claims in advertising, especially when they are targeted towards children and youth. A higher tax rate for UPFs may also be considered as a 'health tax' measure targeted specifically at brands/products that advertise. There is a need to generate greater awareness of the adverse impact of the consumption of UPFs through campaigns targeted at schools and colleges alongside existing health and lifestyle campaigns of the governments.

## RURAL ECONOMY

11.90   The government's emphasis has been on improving the quality of life in rural areas  to  ensure  more  equitable  and  inclusive  development.  Various  measures  have been taken in this regard by focusing on infrastructure encompassing rural housing, drinking  water  and  sanitation,  clean  fuel,  social  protection,  and  rural  connectivity, along with enhancing rural livelihoods. The financing needs of rural households and small businesses are being met through microfinance institutions, SHGs, and other financial  intermediaries.  Taking  digitisation  and  technology  to  the  rural  economy has  also  been  a  key  aspect  of  the  rural  development  agenda,  be  it  in  agricultural activities or governance. For instance, the emphasis on digital land records through SVAMITVA shows a structural shift in rural land management and individual economic empowerment. A primary focus has also been on the health parameters of the rural population, with enhanced emphasis necessitated by the pandemic.

11.92 For  the  development  of  Particularly  Vulnerable  Tribal  Group  (PVTG)  under Pradhan  Mantri  Janjati  Adivasi  Nyaya  Maha  Abhiyan  (PM-JANMAN),  a  separate vertical has been launched under PMGSY by relaxing the population norms upto 100 to provide the connectivity to unconnected PVTG habitations. A total of 8,000 Km of Road length is targeted to be constructed under this vertical. The implementation period is till March 2028.  A total of 1,557 road works of 4,781.44 Km of road length have been sanctioned till 9 January 2025.

## Rural Housing: A Milestone for identity and economic growth

11.93 For most families in India, owning a house is both a milestone and a leap in living standards, especially for the rural poor, where it signifies identity and well-being. Beyond meeting basic needs, rural housing drives local employment and the economy and serves as a durable credit asset that enhances family welfare.

11.94 Providing housing for economically deprived rural households has long been integral  to  India's  development  strategy.  Aligning  with  SDG  Goal  11.1  on  'Safe  and affordable housing' and India's vision of 'Housing for All,' the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) was launched on 1 April 2016. The Government of India has approved Phase-IV of PMGSY to provide all-weather connectivity to 25,000 rural habitations  based  on  the  population  criteria  of  Census  2011.  The  PMGSY-IV  will incorporate international benchmarks and good practices in road construction. The survey of habitations has started through GIS based App. The PM Gati Shakti is being utilized to plan and implement the programme. Box XI.12 discusses the outcomes of PMAY-G, which is not merely providing housing but also many attended benefits that the scheme is bringing to the lives of the rural people.

## Box XI.12: The many outcomes of Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin

PMAY-G aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all houseless families and families living in kutcha and dilapidated houses in rural areas by 2029. The construction of 2.69 crore houses has been completed with support under the scheme since 2016. The scheme has been extended to construct an additional two crore rural houses over the next five  years,  i.e.  till  2029. 178 Holistic  design  and  efficient  implementation  elements  of  the scheme have contributed to its success.

The target  beneficiary  identification  is  made  on  the  basis  of  a  waitlist  derived  from  the Socio-Economic Caste Census, 2011 and Awaas+ survey, 2018, done for this purpose and then  verified  by  the  Gram  Sabhas.  Recently,  the  number  of  objective  exclusion  criteria used for the identification of beneficiaries has been reduced from 13 to 10 (ownership of a fishing boat or motorised two-wheeler, raising the income threshold to ₹15,000 per month were removed) to enhance inclusivity in the target group. The Awaas+ survey, 2024 is also underway to verify eligible beneficiaries.

The  scheme  operates  on  the  DBT  model,  where  assistance  is  credited  directly  into  the beneficiary's  bank  account,  and  construction  work  is  monitored  through  geo-tagged photographs. Evaluation study (National Institute for Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), July 2019 179 )  shows that the introduction of DBT, as well as geotagging, has reduced the levels of administrative clearances required and the time taken for funds to be released as verification became more efficient. It improves fund utilisation of the scheme as it reduces leakages. DBT under the scheme has improved financial inclusion in rural areas (NIPFP, Dec 2019 180 ).

PAHAL - a repository of designs of housing typologies that are suitable to different regions/ states has been developed and made available to the beneficiaries. These designs incorporate elements of disaster resilience, the use of eco-friendly local materials and skills, the use of cost-effective technologies etc. A rural mason training programme has been developed in partnership with the Construction Skill Development Council of India (CSDCI) and the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and launched as part of the scheme to improve the availability of skilled/trained masons in rural areas for construction under the scheme and other works. So far 2,86,843 181 masons have been trained and certified.  With the above measures on average, the time taken for the construction of one unit has improved to 114 days under PMAY-G from 314 days under IAY. 182

The scheme has been a source of employment for labourers, masons, and artisans. The construction of a house under PMAY-G generates direct employment of approximately 314

person-days, which includes 81 skilled, 71 semi-skilled, and 164 unskilled person-days. The  total  direct  employment  generated  for  houses  completed  in  the  first  two  years  of the scheme was 4.82 crore person days for skilled labour and 7.60 crore person days for unskilled labour (NIPFP, 2018 183 ). Extrapolating the estimates, it is seen that more than 192 crore man-days of skilled labour and almost 250 crore man-days of unskilled labour could have been employed since 2016. The study also shows that indirect employment from the backward and forward linkages to construction activities is considerable and beneficial to the rural economy.

The  AwaasSoft  MIS  and  AwaasApp  enable  the  implementation  of  all  functions  and transactions  of  the  scheme  and  evidence-based  monitoring.  This  is  open  to  the  public, allowing  more  transparency.  The  use  of  emerging  technologies,  such  as  AI/ML-based object detection in house images and geo-referencing, enhances transparency and enables better deduplication of PMAY-G assets. Additionally, an eKYC app integrated with Aadhaar and equipped with AI-enabled face authentication technology is used to verify PMAY-G beneficiaries.

The scheme reserves a minimum of 60 per cent of targets for SC/ST households, with 59.58 lakh SC houses and 58.57 lakh ST houses completed. Five per cent of the target is reserved for differently-abled beneficiaries, and another five per cent prioritises housing for families affected by natural disasters.  Scheme has placed a special focus on women's empowerment, with 74 per cent of sanctioned houses owned by women solely or jointly.

PMAY-G converges with schemes like MGNREGA 184 , SBM-G, Jal Jeevan Mission, and Surya Ghar , ensuring beneficiaries access to water, toilets, LPG, electricity, and solar energy. An evaluation shows that the ease of living of beneficiaries is enhanced due to the construction of  the  house  and  88  per  cent  of  respondents  confirmed  improvements  in  the  standard of  living  with  the  construction  of  houses. 185 The  scheme  is  one  of  the  key  interventions facilitating SDG achievements, specifically in terms of the percentage of households living in kuccha houses. 186

## Localising SDGs: Powering rural progress

11.95 Localisation  of  SDGs  ensures  that  rural  development  aligns  with  global goals,  addressing  basic  amenities  such  as  housing,  sanitation,  water  supply,  and electrification. This approach drives inclusive growth and improved quality of life at the grassroots level. SDGs localisation is being pursued at the Gram Panchayat (GP) level through  Village  Panchayat  Development  Plans  under  Mission  Antyodaya 187 and  the

Transformation of Aspirational Districts Programme (TADP), adopted in 2018 188 with districts as the lowest level of implementation. Accelerating forward, the preparation for a Local Indicator Framework (LIF) at the GP level is already in the process where nine themes have been designed spanning across the 17 SDGs. Box XI.13 discusses these initiatives.

## Box XI.13: Localisation of Sustainable Development Goals

The adoption of 17 SDGs in 2015 marked a paradigm shift in how the world understood and prepared itself to pursue the development agenda. India continues to wholeheartedly accept, engage, and progress with the idea of SDG implementation. Our timely submission of Voluntary National Reviews of 2017, 2020 and 2023 189 and the adoption of the SDG Index 190 reflects India's commitment to the cause. The call for 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' and the vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047 lays the roadmap for achieving the SDGs.

A  'whole-of-the-government'  strategy  with  an  emphasis  on  cooperative  and  competitive federalism  among  states  is  being  followed.    The  'collaborative  competition'  approach, supported by comparative rankings on SDG progress, has generated momentum among states and complements the strategy.

There is a global shift towards the 'localisation' of SDGs to achieve the goals by 2030 and increase the rate and impact of progress. SDG localisation is the process of adapting and customising these goals and translating them into local development plans and strategies that fit the needs, context and priorities of a particular region or locality in coherence with national frameworks (United Nations, 2024). 191 This approach places local communities at the centre of sustainable development and anchors development action on the principles of subsidiarity, inclusion, partnership and multilevel governance, with adequate data and financing availability at the local level.

In India, state governments have been proactive and have laid out strategies and frameworks for  achieving  SDGs  at  various  administrative  levels.  Some  states  have  extended  their indicator frameworks to the district and block levels, ensuring that local budgets align with SDG objectives. This multi-layered approach to SDG implementation is based on the Indian model of SDG Localisation 192 comprising four key pillars: creating institutional ownership, fostering collaborative competition, enhancing capacities, and embracing a whole-of-society approach.

## Kerala offers a replicable model for SDG localisation.

Kerala uses a robust, community-based model that leverages its strong local governance institutions.  Awareness and community engagement efforts focus on educating local officials on the relevance of poverty alleviation and environmental resilience, which are led by state and  national  leaders.  The  Local  Self  Government  Department,  with  technical  support from the Kerala Institute for Local Administration (KILA), have developed comprehensive guidelines and processes to incorporate SDGs into local planning. They also train stakeholders in SDG-aligned development and data collection. The state has a real-time SDG dashboard to monitor the panchayats and is able to use such localised data for decision-making and to provide insights on development indicators.

Localisation efforts are driven by the   SDG Coordination Centres (SDGCCs) in states and UTs by governments in partnership with implementing agencies.  Currently, SDGCCs are operational in 10 states/UTs, namely Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Karnataka, Nagaland, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. These  centres  play  a  pivotal  role  in  supporting  and  facilitating  implementation  on  the ground.  This  is  achieved  through  integrated  policymaking,  fostering  interlinkages  and synergies, establishing monitoring systems, adopting a convergence-based approach, and fostering participation at all levels of government among all stakeholders.

Over the past six years, the SDGCCs have established a strong foundation for understanding and ownership of the SDGs at the state level. With all levels of government fully committed to achieving the SDGs, there has been a shift in departmental mindsets towards adopting result-based, integrated planning. Through continuous training and handholding support, departments  are  increasingly  aligning  their  efforts  with  outcome-linked  planning  and budgeting. This evolution has fostered evidence-based decision-making and the identification of viable solutions, to reach the most vulnerable population first, realising the principle of 'Leaving No One Behind'.

NITI Aayog is transitioning to SDG Coordination and Acceleration Centres (SDGCACs) 193 as we approach the 2030 deadline. The SDGCACs will uphold the current SDGCC approach while  encouraging  innovative  solutions,  scaling  up  successful  initiatives  and  fostering synergistic  collaborations  among  diverse  stakeholders.  They  aim  to  (a)  go  beyond  the planning  department  and  intensify  engagement  with  other  key  departments,  especially the finance department (b) go beyond the whole of the government approach and foster the  whole  of  the  society  approach  for  the  systematic  and  sustained  participation  of  civil society organisations (CSOs) and private sectors and (c) have an interconnected approach to challenges by identifying critical actors and working towards a collaboration.

In conclusion, the localisation of SDGs ensures that rural development is in harmony with international goals, focusing on essential services like housing, sanitation, water supply, and electrification. This strategy promotes inclusive growth and enhances the quality of life at the grassroots level.

193 SDGCCs  are  Specialised  Project  Management  Units  within  State  Government  departments  of  Planning, Economics and Statistics or Finance to align the planning process with the SDGs. (https://sdgknowledgehub. undp.org.in/sdgcc/ )

## Other measures towards rural welfare

11.96 Food,  Nutrition,  Health,  and  WASH  (FNHW): To  address  health, nutrition, WASH, and sanitation issues, DAY-NRLM implements FNHW interventions, focusing on promoting the consumption of produce from nutri-gardens, poultry, small ruminants, and dairy. Currently, FNHW interventions are being implemented in 5369 blocks across 682 districts. 194

11.97 Social Inclusion and Gender: State  Rural  Livelihoods  Missions  (SRLMs) have  developed  state-specific  strategies  to  integrate  DAY-NRLM  components  and community  institutions,  addressing  issues  such  as  child  education,  early  marriage, asset  creation  for  women,  and  violence  against  women.  Currently,  32  SRLMs  are implementing these gender interventions.

11.98 Gender Resource Centres (GRCs) are being established to address gender issues at the local level, supported by Gender Point Persons (GPPs) who sensitise SHG members on gender-based violence and discrimination. GPPs are trained by Gender Community Resource Persons (Gender-CRPs), who build capacity in both SHG members and the wider community.

11.99 Over 25 lakh GPPs and more than 89,000 Gender-CRPs work within more than 31,000 Cluster Level Federations (CLFs) and 5,00,000 Village Organisations (VOs), tackling gender issues with the support of 40,061 GP-level Gender Forums and 1927 Block-level Gender Forums. A total of 3997 GRCs are operating across 18 States and UTs under DAY-NRLM, empowering women and gender-diverse persons to address violence and access their rights.

11.100 Free legal  assistance  in  remote  and  rural  areas: The  National  Legal Services Authority (NALSA), established under the Legal Services Authorities (LSA) Act of 1987, provides free legal services to disadvantaged sections of society to ensure equal access to justice, as outlined in Section 12 of the Act. It operates through legal service institutions from the Taluk Court to the Supreme Court, offering services such as legal aid, advice, awareness programmes, Lok Adalats, and the Victim Compensation Scheme.

11.101  Additionally, the government has launched the 'Designing Innovative Solutions for Holistic Access to Justice in India' scheme, which strengthens pre-litigation advice through Tele-Law, facilitates pro bono legal services via the Nyaya Bandhu programme, and  promotes  legal literacy through  pan-India  awareness  campaigns,  utilising technology, and region-specific IEC materials to improve accessibility for the poor and marginalised.

11.102  The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008 aims to provide access to justice at the grassroots level in rural areas. As of October 2024, 313 Gram Nyayalayas have disposed of over 2.99 lakh cases from December 2020 to October 2024. 195

11.103  The National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) is a social security programme for the vulnerable section of our society. The objective of the programme is to provide a basic level of financial assistance to old age, widows, and disabled persons as well as to bereaved households in the event of the death of the breadwinner belonging to the Below Poverty Line. NSAP caters to 3.09 crore BPL beneficiaries. Further, States/UTs are also providing financial assistance to additional 5.86 crore beneficiaries through State Pension Schemes. Therefore, around nine crore beneficiaries (central NSAP plus additional state beneficiaries) are covered under the pension safety net of the country at an estimated annual expenditure of more than ₹1 lakh crore. 196

## Enhancing rural incomes

## Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana-National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAYNRLM)

11.104   DAY-NRLM  is  a  flagship  poverty  alleviation  programme,  launched  in  2011 with  the  aim  to  reduce  poverty  by  enabling  poor  households  to  access  gainful  selfemployment and skilled wage employment opportunities, resulting in sustainable and diversified livelihood options for the poor. This is one of the world's largest initiatives to improve the livelihoods of the poor.

11.105   The  Mission  seeks  to  achieve  its  objective  through  investing  in  four  core components  viz.,  (a)  social  mobilisation  and  promotion  and  strengthening  of  selfmanaged and financially sustainable community institution so the rural poor women; (b)  financial  inclusion;  (c)  sustainable  livelihoods;  and  (d)  social  inclusion,  social development, and access to entitlements through convergence.

11.106   The  programme  leverages  community  resources  (social  capital)  to  build institutions and promote livelihoods, with trained SHG members serving as CRPs in various roles like Pashu Sakhi, Krishi Sakhi, Bank Sakhi, Bima Sakhi, CRP-EP, Poshan Sakhi etc. The key programme components and their progress is as follows. 197

## Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme

11.107  The MGNREGA 2005 aims at enhancing the livelihood security of households in  rural  areas  of  the  country  by  providing  at  least  100  days  of  guaranteed  wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The physical progress of MGNREGS (the Scheme through which MGNREGA is implemented) is indicated below:

Table XI.8: Key indicators on MGNREGS

| Indicator                         |   2020-21 |   2021-22 |   2022-23 |   2023-24* |   2024-25* |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Person-days generated (in crore)  |     389.1 |     363.3 |     293.8 |      308.9 |     220.11 |
| Average person-days per household |      51.5 |      50.1 |      47.8 |       52.1 |      42.77 |
| Women participation rate (%age)   |      53.2 |      54.7 |      57.5 |       58.9 |      57.97 |

*As per MIS (as of 10 January 2025)

11.108  Multiple efficiency reforms have been introduced to fully utilise the scheme. To ensure probity and elimination of leakages, geotagging before, during, and after the work is being done, 99.98 per cent payments are through National Electronic Fund Management System, wages are transferred under DBT, Aadhaar-based payment has been enabled for 96.3 per cent of total active workers, 99.23 per cent of total successful transactions for wage beneficiaries has been processed through APBS (Aadhaar Payment Bridge System)  in Dec 2024and social audit units have been set up in 28 states/UTs.

11.109  While MGNREGS began as a wage employment scheme, it has evolved into a durable rural asset creation programme for sustainable livelihood diversification, as seen in the rise in the share of individual beneficiary 'works on individual land' from 16.2 per cent of total completed works in FY15 to 71.2 per cent in FY25 (the share in terms of expenditure is much lower, yet rose from 11.65 per cent in FY15 to 28.9 per cent in FY25). MGNREGS has also helped in boosting rural ecological health through improvement of soil quality and plantation and has improved rural water management for agriculture through  integrated  watershed  management  (IWM)  assets.  Capacity  development  of workers is being promoted through initiatives like Bare Foot Technicians (BFT) 198 and UNNATI 199 skilling project.

11.110  Further,  the  scheme  is  converged  with  various  initiatives,  including  NutriGardens with NRLM, fodder farms with the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD), horticulture with the Ministry of Agriculture, medicinal plantations with the Ministry of Ayush, Gram Panchayat buildings with the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, community sanitary complexes with SBM Grameen, construction of Anganwadi Centres  with  Ministry  of  Women  and  Child  Development,  promoting  sericulture plantations  with  Ministry  of  Textiles,  supporting  rubber  plantations  with  Rubber Board (Ministry of Commerce),  promoting aquaculture in ponds and farm ponds with Department of Fisheries, rural roads with PM Gram Sadak Yojana, and all-weather roads with BRO for border areas. Apart from that, convergence is also made at the state  level  with  different  state  departments  such  as  Forest  Department,  agriculture Department, Horticulture  Department,  Tribal  Development  Department  and  others for implementation of developmental works in rural areas.

## OUTLOOK

11.111  The Indian economy's growth story emphasises a welfare-enhancement approach by  the  government,  focusing  on  empowering  all  citizens  and  ensuring  the  efficient delivery of welfare measures. The government's initiatives aim to provide opportunities

198  So far, 9186 BFTs have been trained in 20 States.

199 A  total  of  2,00,000  beneficiaries  to  be  trained  till  March  2025  with  an  estimated  financial  expenditure  of Rs.307.34 Crore. A total of 73,628 beneficiaries have been trained till 30th September 2025.

for everyone, enabling them to achieve their professional and personal goals. With the focus on education, health, skilling, and innovation, with improved social and economic infrastructure the aim is to achieve welfare for all.

11.112   While the education and health system has made significant progress through various initiatives aimed at achieving national goals, there is a critical need to enhance the delivery mechanisms. By rethinking and improving these systems and integrating innovation and technologies, one can ensure that benefits effectively reach the last mile and are fully realised by those who need them most.

11.113    The  importance of focusing on learning outcomes is underscored by reports revealing the gap between class standards and actual learning levels. To address this gap and enhance learning outcomes, it is crucial to implement innovative teaching methods and strategies that prioritise peer learning, social and emotional development, digital literacy, and life skills. These approaches will not only boost academic performance but also foster cognitive and critical thinking skills among students.

11.114   Policymaking in India emphasises preventive health to enhance life expectancy, quality  of  life,  and  economic  growth  through  lower  healthcare  costs  and  improved productivity.  The  National  Health  Policy  2017  advocates  universal  health  coverage, affordable  care,  and  prevention  of  NCDs.  Advancements  in  physical  and  digital infrastructure, including eSanjeevani, UWIN, NDHM, drones, and AI, have improved healthcare  access,  particularly  in  underserved  areas.  Mental  health  initiatives  and strategies to promote healthier lifestyles are crucial for addressing NCDs and boosting productivity.

11.115    The  government's  focus  on  rural  infrastructure,  housing,  and  livelihoods reflects a comprehensive 'welfare for all' approach. By improving rural connectivity, sanitation, housing, access to drinking water, and social inclusion, alongside supporting microfinance,  SHGs,  and  localisation  of  SDGs,  these  initiatives  ensure  inclusive development.  Together,  they  uplift  rural  communities,  bridging  gaps  in  equity  and quality of life.

11.116    Regulatory institutions in the areas of health and education must constantly balance the needs of the society and that of the ease of provision of such services by the  providers.  Where  the  market  can  do  an  effective  job,  regulations  can  either  be withdrawn or compliance made voluntary with disclosure. Tight regulations increase the compliance and supervision burden on state capacity that is already stretched. This gives rise to unfulfilled expectations on the part of the public. Therefore, for India to receive the demographic dividend in full in the coming years, regulatory institutions need  to  evolve  to  focus  on  allowing  outcomes  to  happen  without  being  fixated  on

inputs. Trust-based regulation backed up by transparency and disclosure on the part of the regulated deserves a chance. Regulators must develop their assessment parameters and report on their own effectiveness transparently.  There is no better way to demand right behaviour than to set an example.
