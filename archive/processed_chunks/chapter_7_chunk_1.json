The global nature of the problem makes India one of the most vulnerable regions despite having contributed only about 4 per cent in the cumulative global  emissions  (for  the  period  1850-2019)  and  maintaining  its  per  capita  emission at  far  less  than  the  world  average.  While  India  is  less  responsible  for  the  high  stock of  emissions, however, it has consistently engaged in demonstrating global leadership towards adopting various measures and ensuring a low-emission growth pathway with a commitment to the net-zero emissions goal by 2070.\n\nIndia has integrated the development goals with ambitious climate action goals, be it in the form of augmented solar power capacity (installed), higher energy saving targeting notified in P AT cycle-VII, improved green cover facilitated by Green India Mission, among other targeted Government actions. As part of dedicated efforts to preserve ecosystems, India  now  has  75  Ramsar  sites  for  wetlands,  in  addition  to  various  regulatory  and promotional measures to protect and conserve mangroves. Continued river conservation and  rejuvenation  efforts  are  underway  through  Namami  Gange  and  National  River Conservation Plan (NRCP).\n\nIn August 2022, the country updated the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in  line  with  the  Hon'ble  PM' s  vision  expressed  in  the  26th  meeting  of  the  Conference of  Parties of UNFCCC. In terms of transition to renewable energy sources, India has already achieved its target of 40 per cent installed electric capacity from non-fossil fuels ahead of 2030. It has advanced the target to 50 per cent, which shall also translate to a significant reduction in the average emission rate. The National Hydrogen Mission and Green Hydrogen Policy have been introduced to enable India to be energy independent by 2047. Its pivotal role is also reflected in India' s Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS).\n\nThe availability of adequate and affordable finance remains a constraint in India's climate actions. The country has so far largely met its requirements from domestic sources only. Finance is a critical input for its climate actions. Therefore, the country has scaled up its efforts towards mobilising private capital, including through sovereign green bonds, to meet climate action goals. A framework for the latter has been issued in compliance with International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles (2021).\n\nIndia's  initiatives  on  the  international  stage  have  been  noteworthy.  The  country  has actively engaged in global actions by championing the formation and strengthening of various intergovernmental organisations.\n\n##",
