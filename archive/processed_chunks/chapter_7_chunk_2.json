GHG emissions remain in the  atmosphere for  tens  to  hundreds  of  years,  trapping  the  sun's  heat  from  escaping. While within limits, these make our earth more habitable, allowing for salubrious weather conditions, the enhanced emissions have led to rising temperatures with the potential to bring about sea level rise, change monsoon cycles and impact land systems.\n- 7.2 GHG emissions are the most significant threat to humanity and the inescapable reality the world faces. Action to reduce carbon emissions and adapt to the changing climatic conditions are required urgently as the world has already started to experience its consequences. For instance, it is estimated that by 2030, about 700 million people worldwide will be at risk of displacement by drought alone (U.N. SDG Portal). Thus, global warming is a reality, and so is climate change. Nor is there much doubt that human activity is primarily responsible for it this time, although climate change occurred in the distant past even when Planet Earth was scarcely populated.\n- 7.3 Despite agreement on the above, there can still be much divergence about what comes next and what to do about it when it comes to climate change. Much of the global angst associated with climate change is about the emission of GHGs and carbon, in particular. The more GHGs are emitted, the more they stay trapped in the atmosphere, accelerating global warming. Hence, the argument goes that if some of the cataclysmic consequences are to be avoided, then global warming must be arrested, slowed and, if possible, reversed. One way to strive for it is to reduce emissions of GHG, including carbon. Many nations pledge to reduce their net emission to zero by 2050. Some wish to achieve it by 2060 and by 2070.\n\nFigure vii.1: net Zero Pledges of countries (the Year pledged is on top of the bars)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Emissions Gap Report 2022, UNEP\n\n- 7.4 However,  this  is  where  things  begin  to  get  interesting.  Science  is  not  very  clear  on whether further emission reduction would necessarily guarantee a stoppage or reversal of global warming.  The reason being much carbon dioxide and other GHGs have already been emitted over the last two and half centuries of industrialisation-led economic growth in today's advanced nations, principally in North America and Europe. The share of developing countries in the stock of GHGs (usually measured as carbon dioxide equivalent) has been minimal compared to developed countries. This is corroborated by the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which highlights that the challenges faced due to global warming are mainly due to cumulative historical and current GHG emissions of developed countries. The impact of the accumulation would also be iniquitous, with the developing countries not only bearing the brunt of climate change but also constrained by their capacity to respond to its challenges. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) notes that high human vulnerability global hotspots are found particularly  in West,  Central  &amp;  East Africa,  South Asia,  Central,  and  South America,  Small Island Developing States, and the Arctic.\n- 7.5 Further, as per the report, Asia is most vulnerable to climate change, especially to extreme heat, flooding, sea level rise, and erratic rainfall. Ironically, the burden of adaptation is highest for those who have contributed the least to global warming. That unfortunate inevitability means that the stock of GHGs in the atmosphere may have already set a train of events that future emission reduction could do very little to stop or reverse.\n- 7.6 Even if the answer to this question is unclear or unknown, some correctly argue that not doing whatever we can to make the planet more liveable and less dangerous may amount to criminal negligence. The problem is that the people and nations making this argument have their priorities correct for themselves but not for the countries yet to climb the ladder of prosperity. It is an enduring principle of economics that resources have competing uses and that there are always trade-offs.\n- 7.7 Today's developing nations are therefore caught in the horns of a dilemma. How much resources to devote to bread-and-butter developmental priorities and to adapting to the already changing  climate,  and  how  much  to  dedicate  to  mitigating  emissions  of  GHGs?  Today's developed nations have prospered through the unrestricted use of fossil fuels, including coal, crude oil, and natural gas. It is theoretically elegant to argue that switching to renewable or nonfossil fuel energy would generate investments and jobs. Still, it seldom works out so smoothly in practice.\n- 7.8 For example, China has declared that future energy supplies, including alternative ones, must  be  secured  first  before  dispensing  with  existing  energy  sources.  Countries  might  find themselves not scrapping coal-fired power plants, and the alternatives may be held up either due to a lack of technology, financial resources, skilled and trained human resources, or some combination of all three. Countries have also learnt that the jobs that are likely to be created in the so-called 'green economy' are tilted towards skill and technology-intensive than in traditional industries. 1 One may also argue that it may be easier to speak of retraining and relocating people than actually doing so.\n\n- 7.9 Nobel Laureate Thomas Schelling (2005) argued that the most effective way to combat climate change was to let nations grow first 2 :\n- 'If  per  capita  income  growth  in  the  next  40  years  compares  with  the  40  years  just  past, vulnerability  to  climate  change  should  diminish,  and  the  resources  available  for  adaptation should be greater. I say this not to minimise concern about climate change but to anticipate whether  developing  countries  should  make  sacrifices  in  their  development  to  minimise  the emission of gases that may change the climate to their disadvantage. Their best defence against climate change may be their own continued development.'\n- 7.10  That  economic  growth  would  enable  resource  generation  will  come  as  no  surprise  to students of corporate finance. Companies generate profits and internal resources and thus fund their investments. For companies worldwide, the single biggest source of finance for their capital investments is their own resources before they turn to markets. That would work for nations too.\n- 7.11  Another  reason  why  it  is  a  realistic  proposition  is  that  securing  funding  from  either developed nations or multilateral organisations is rather difficult. Public finances in developed countries are stretched and do not seem to have the intent to mobilise adequate resources for climate action in developing countries. They also do not have the appetite to provide additional capital to multilateral institutions for them to be able to lend more or mobilise greater resources. Further,  the  willingness  and  incentives-alignment  of  the  private  sector  to  undertake  longgestation projects are questionable at best or non-existent at worst.\n- 7.12  Lastly, it does not seem so strange or irresponsible that developing countries must put their own growth and development aspirations ahead of their global climate obligations when one considers that developed countries set aside their obsessive concerns about climate change and global warming to burn more coal to generate electricity this year. Aiming to reduce their dependence on Russian crude oil and natural gas, countries in Europe had to switch to coal to keep their homes warm and well-lit 3 . The behaviour of European nations in 2022, eminently understandable, demonstrates the return of energy security as a prime requirement for countries. Therefore, it stands to reason that it would be no different for developing economies too.\n- 7.13  Earlier  in  the  year,  the  OECD  and  the  Social  Economics  Lab  at  Harvard  teamed  up to  understand  why  policies  to  address  climate  change  have  been  difficult  to  implement  and surveyed  over  40,000  respondents  across  20  of  the  world's  most  carbon-emitting  countries (representing 72 per cent of global CO 2 emissions). The findings were striking 4 .  In  general, citizens in developed countries expressed considerable reluctance to change their lifestyles and habits with respect to driving, flying and eating that would contribute to reduced emissions. Policies to implement carbon pricing have not been easy in all European countries. France tried and retreated in 2018. Switzerland's proposal was defeated in a referendum in 2021.\n\n2 Thomas C. Schelling (1992): 'Some economics of global warming', American Economic Review, March 1992 Some Economics of Global Warming on JSTOR\n\n3 'Germany Revives Coal as Energy Security Trumps Climate Goals', Bloomberg, 22 December 2022 (https://www.bloomberg.com/news/ articles/2022-12-22/germany-returns-to-coal-as-energy-security-trumps-climate-goals)\n\n4 'Fighting Climate Change: International Attitudes Toward Climate Policies', NBER Working Paper No. 30265, September 2022 (https:// www.nber.org/papers/w30265)\n\n- 7.14  As though these challenges are not enough, many experts also warn of the availability of rare earth elements (REE) and critical minerals (CM) to be the next geopolitical battleground as crude oil has been over the last fifty years. 5  As we are aware, REE and CM are essential for generating renewable energy. The problem is that they are produced in a few countries and processed in even fewer countries. A globally synchronised energy transition to non-fossil fuels might be difficult to pull off if adequate REE and CM are not available. That would leave the fossil fuel-based assets stranded for many countries' economies!\n- 7.15  Jean  Pisani-Ferry,  associated  with  the  Bruegel  Institute  and  an  advisor  to  the  French Government,  has  begun  to  sound  the  alarm  about  climate  change's  significant  short-run macroeconomic costs. Citing him in his article for the International Monetary Fund's 'Finance and Development', Daniel Yergin writes 6 ,\n- ' The economist Jean Pisani-Ferry, cofounder of Bruegel, Europe's leading economic think tank, has observed that accelerating the targets for net carbon emission reductions too aggressively could  create  much  larger  economic  disruptions  than  generally  anticipated-what  he  called 'an adverse supply shock-very much like the shocks of the 1970s.' Such a transition, PisaniFerry presciently wrote in 2021, just before the current energy crisis began, is 'unlikely to be benign and policymakers should get ready for tough choices.' He subsequently added, in 2022: 'Climate action has become a major macroeconomic issue, but the macroeconomics of climate action is far from the level of rigour and precision that is now necessary to provide a sound basis for public discussions and to guide policymakers adequately. For understandable reasons, advocacy has too often taken precedence over analysis. But at this stage of the  discussion, complacent  scenarios  have  become  counterproductive.  The  policy  conversation  now  needs methodical, peer-examined assessments of the potential costs and benefits of alternative plans for action. '\n- 7.16  However, whether we like it or not, the climate change issue will be increasingly relevant and will occupy the airwaves and the attention of policymakers. Countries, even if they wait for financial, technological and human resources for emissions mitigation, have to take action to make their people resilient and adapt to climate change. So, actions on multiple fronts are needed, including the estimation of resources, lifestyle adjustments etc.\n- 7.17  Here, India, considered to be one of the most vulnerable countries given its long coastline, monsoon-dependent agriculture, and large agrarian economy, is one of the leading examples of this. It has contributed only 4 per cent (until 2019) to the cumulative global emissions and its per capita emission is far less than the world average.\n- 7.18  The fact that climate change is a global phenomenon and requires collective efforts has been widely accepted and is the basis of the commitments in the United Nations Framework Convention  on  Climate  Change  (UNFCCC)  and  its  Paris  Agreement.  Recognising  the differentiated responsibility of countries (in view of their role in GHG emissions) and the higher developmental needs of the developing countries, they call for a collective action based on the\n\n5 'The new-style energy crisis', Daniel Yergin interviewed by Project Syndicate, July 2022 (https://www.project-syndicate.org/onpoint/newstyle-energy-crisis-by-daniel-yergin-2022-07)\n\n6 Daniel Yergin (2022): 'Bumps in the Energy Transition', Finance &amp; Development, International Monetary Fund, December 2022 (https:// www.imf.org/en/Publications/fandd/issues/2022/12/bumps-in-the-energy-transition-yergin)\n\nprinciples of equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC). The collective action has translated into NDCs-through which each country has made a commitment to work towards a collective goal of keeping temperature rise to below 2° C above pre-industrial levels.\n\n- 7.19  India has been striving to pursue the goal of sustainable development. It spearheads one of the most robust climate actions through its NDCs, which includes an ambitious programme for transitions to clean energy in the world. Despite the adverse impacts of Covid-19 on the economy, the country has enhanced its climate ambition manifold and embarked on a long-term strategy towards a low GHG emission based development.\n- 7.20  Having set the context, this chapter presents an updated discussion on the issue of climate change from India's perspective, including a discussion on forests and their role in mitigating carbon emissions, an approach to transition to renewable energy and the recently submitted low emissions development strategy. The chapter further presents a discussion on the outcomes of the 27 th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 27), progress made on enabling financing for sustainable development and India's role in global efforts towards addressing climate change. Besides this, recent changes in environmental regulations and other environmental aspects, such as biodiversity and wildlife, are also discussed.\n\n## Progress on india's Climate action\n\n7.21  India's climate vision is integrally linked to its vision of development that foregrounds the goals of poverty eradication and guaranteeing basic well-being to all its citizens. Action on addressing climate action was initiated even before the Paris Agreement came into being. In 2008, India launched the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC), establishing eight National Missions, covering several initiatives and a slew of measures in the area of solar, water, energy  efficiency,  forests,  sustainable  habitat,  sustainable  agriculture,  sustaining  Himalayan ecosystem, capacity building and research and development (R&amp;D).\n\nFigure vii.2: Progress on eight national missions of the naPCC highlighting achievements across various domains\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| National Solar Mission                                     | • Solar power capacity of 61.62GW installed by October 2022                                                                                                                    |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency            | • PAT Cycle - VII notified in October 2021 for energy saving target of 6.63 Million Tonnes of Oil Equivalent (MTOE)                                                            |\n| National Mission on Sustainable Habitat                    | • 721 km of metro rail network made operational by August 2022. • 62.79 lakh individual household toilets and 6.21 lakh community and public toilets constructed by April 2022 |\n| National Mission for a Green India                         | •₹ 626.96 crore for afforestation targets over an area of 2.1 lakh ha                                                                                                          |\n| National Water Mission                                     | • Jal Shakti Abhiyan: Catch The Rain 2022                                                                                                                                      |\n| National Mission on Strategic Knowledge for Climate Change | • Created and strengthened 12 Centres of Excellence for climate change (June 2021)                                                                                             |\n| National Mission for Sustaining Himalayan Ecosystems       | • Inter-University Consortium • 8 MajorR&D Programmes initiated                                                                                                                |\n| National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture               | • Key targets for FY 2022-2023 covering 0.15 lakh ha under organic farming and 10 lakh ha under micro irrigation                                                               |\n\n7.22  National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC), a central sector scheme, was initiated in 2015-16 to support adaptation activities in the States and Union Territories (UTs) of India that are vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. NAFCC is implemented in project mode, and to date, 30 projects have been sanctioned in 27 States and UTs with a total project cost of ₹847.5 crore. NAFCC supports adaptation action, in, inter alia, agriculture, water, forestry, livestock, and restoring ecosystems. At present (November 2022), 28 projects are under implementation.\n\n7.23  Demonstrating higher ambition in its climate action, the Government of India submitted its updated NDC on August 26, 2022. The new NDC with enhanced targets translates the vision of the Hon'ble PM expressed through the ' Panchamrit' at the UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP 26) in Glasgow in November 2021. The vision mentions of sustainable lifestyles and climate justice to protect the poor and vulnerable from the adverse impacts of climate change. Aligning with this vision, the share of non-fossil fuel-based capacity in overall capacity has risen rapidly over time.  Including the large hydro, the share of non-fossil sources in total installed electricity capacity is estimated to be about 40.4 per cent (on 31.09.2022) compared to 27.3 per cent in 2014-15. This period has seen a sizeable enhancement in the share of installed electricity capacity in solar and wind energy from 8.9 per cent in 2014-15 to 25.1 per cent in 2022-23 (April-Sept).\n\n## Box vii.1: india's updated nationally determined Contribution (ndC)\n\nIndia submitted its first NDC to UNFCCC in October 2015. This was updated in August 2022. The 2015 NDC comprised eight goals, three of which were quantitative targets to be achieved up to 2030. The three targets included cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil sources to reach 40 per cent, reduction in the emissions intensity of GDP by 33 to 35 per cent compared to 2005 levels, and creation of additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO 2 equivalent through additional forest and tree cover.\n\nArticle 4 of the Paris Agreement provides that each Party shall communicate or update its NDC every five years. Therefore, in accordance with the aforesaid provision of the Paris Agreement, India submitted the following updates to its first NDC of 2015.\n\n1. T o  put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions and values of conservation and moderation, including through a mass movement for 'LIFE''Lifestyle for Environment' as a key to combating climate change.\n2. T o adopt a climate-friendly and cleaner path than the one followed hitherto by others at the corresponding level of economic development.\n3. T o reduce the Emissions Intensity of its GDP by 45 per cent by 2030, from the 2005 level.\n4. T o  achieve  about  50  per  cent  cumulative  electric  power  installed  capacity  from  non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, with the help of the transfer of technology and low-cost international finance, including from the Green Climate Fund (GCF).\n\n5. T o  create  an  additional  carbon  sink  of  2.5  to  3  billion  tonnes  of  CO 2 equivalent  through additional forest and tree cover by 2030.\n6. T o better adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in development programmes in sectors vulnerable to climate change, particularly agriculture, water resources, the Himalayan region, coastal regions, and health and disaster management.\n7. T o mobilise domestic and new &amp; additional funds from developed countries to implement the above mitigation and adaptation actions in view of the resource required and the resource gap.\n8. T o build capacities and create a domestic framework and international architecture for quick diffusion of cutting-edge climate technology in India and for joint collaborative R&amp;D for such future technologies.\n\nSource: Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change\n\n## Status of Forest and tree Cover\n\n7.24  One of the three quantifiable targets of India's NDC is to achieve an additional carbon sink of 2.5 billion to 3.0 billion tonnes through additional forest and tree cover by 2030. The forest and tree cover in India has shown a gradual and steady trend of increase in the last one and a half decades.\n\n7.25  The country ranks third globally with respect to the net gain in average annual forest area between 2010 and 2020. This gain is mainly attributed to the robust framework and policies of the National and State Governments that have promoted and safeguarded forests. Schemes like the Green India Mission (GIM), Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (CAMPA), National Afforestation Programme (NAP), Green Highway Policy - 2015, Policy for enhancement of Urban Greens, National Agro-forestry Policy, and Sub-Mission on Agro-forestry (SMAF), etc. are among the most important ones.\n\n## Carbon Stock in india's Forest and tree Cover\n\n7.26  A robust forest ecosystem is a vital sink of carbon.  Forest Survey of India (FSI) assessed the carbon stock (which is the amount of carbon sequestrated from the atmosphere and stored in biomass, deadwood, soil, and litter in the forest) in India's forests for the first time in 2004 and then biennially since 2011. The Indian State of Forest Report (ISFR) estimates the carbon stock of forests to be about 7,204 million tonnes in 2019 7 , which is an increase of 79.4 million tonnes of carbon stock as compared to the estimates of the previous assessment for 2017. This translates into carbon emissions sequestrated through forest and tree cover to be 30.1 billion tonnes of CO 2 equivalent.\n\n7 ISFR-2021. https://fsi.nic.in/forest-report-2021-details\n\nFigure vii.3: Carbon stock in forests in india has been rising\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Based on data of the Forest Survey of India\n\n7.27  Among the Indian States, Arunachal Pradesh has the maximum carbon stock in forests (1023.84 million tonnes), followed by Madhya Pradesh (609.25 million tonnes). The per-hectare forest carbon stock among different States/UTs indicates that Jammu &amp; Kashmir is contributing the maximum per-hectare carbon stock of 173.41 tonnes, followed by Himachal Pradesh (167.0 tonnes), Sikkim (166.2 tonnes) and Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands (162.9 tonnes).\n\n## Preservation of ecosystems: a Critical adaptation action\n\n7.28  Ecosystems  play  an  important  role  in  carbon  storage,  protect  the  coastal  areas,  and enhance water quality besides other services, such as cultural, spiritual or tourist attractions. Wetlands are natural buffers against floods, droughts, and tropical cyclones. Wetlands can act as sponges, storing peak rainfall and releasing water gradually during the lean season. The floods in Kashmir Valley in September 2014 and Chennai city in December 2015 are reminders of the ways wetland destruction can make lives vulnerable. The Ramsar Convention, signed on February 2, 1971, is one of the oldest inter-governmental accords signed by member countries to  preserve  the  ecological  character  of  their  wetlands  of  international  importance.  Wetlands declared as Ramsar sites are protected. India has 75 Ramsar sites covering an area of 13.3 lakh ha, and 49 of these have been added in the last 8 years.\n\n7.29  Mangroves and coastal wetlands form the first line of defence for coastal communities against increased storm surges, flooding, and hurricanes. As per a recent study, certain mangrove species in Chilika and Sundarbans along the east coast and Dwarka and Porbandar along the west coast of India are likely to reduce and shift landward by 2070 due to a decline in suitable habitats in response to precipitation and sea level changes. 8\n\n7.30  The  Government  has  taken  both  regulatory  and  promotional  measures  to  protect  and conserve  mangroves.  The  National  Coastal  Mission  Programme  on  'Conservation  and Management of Mangroves and Coral Reefs' is being implemented. Regulatory measures are implemented through Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Notification (2019) under the Environment\n\n8 Pujarini Samal, Jyoti Srivastava, S.R.

As per the ISFR 2021, the mangrove cover in the country has increased by 364 sq. km. in 2021 as compared to 2013.\n\nFigure vii.4: increasing mangrove cover in india\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: ISFR 2021\n\n## river Conservation and rejuvenation\n\n7.31  The Government is working on mapping and converging the 5Ps' - People, Policy, Plan, Programme and Project. It has been supplementing the efforts of the States/Union Territories (UTs) by providing financial and technical assistance for the abatement of pollution in identified polluted stretches of rivers in the country through the Central Sector Scheme of Namami Gange for  River  Ganga  and  its  tributaries,  and  the  Centrally  Sponsored  Scheme  of  National  River Conservation Plan (NRCP) for other rivers.\n\n7.32  In  addition,  the  government  has  recently  released  Detailed  Project  Reports  (DPR)  for the rejuvenation of 13 major rivers prepared by the Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education  (ICFRE),  Dehradun  in  consultation  with  the  State  Forest  Departments  and  other line  Departments.  Works  proposed  under  these  DPRs  include  afforestation  on  riverbanks leading to increased green cover, measures to contain soil erosion, recharge the groundwater table,  sequester  carbon  dioxide,  catchment  area  treatment,  ecological  restoration,  moisture conservation, livelihood improvement &amp; income generation, etc.\n\n## approach to transition to renewable energy Sources\n\n7.33  While the target was to achieve 40 per cent of the installed electric capacity from nonfossil fuel sources by 2030 in the initial NDC submitted in 2015, the target has already been achieved. India is now striving to achieve the target of 50 per cent cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030, in line with updated NDCs.\n\nFigure vii.5: increasing installed electricity generation Capacity with a rising share of nonfossil fuel-based capacity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Based on data from the Ministry of Power.\n\n7.34  India is progressively becoming a favoured destination for investment in renewables. As per the Renewables 2022 Global Status Report, during the period 2014 -2021, total investment in  renewables  stood  at  US$  78.1  billion  in  India.  Investment  in  renewable  energy  has  been close to or higher than US$ 10 billion per year since 2016, except for a dip in 2020 likely due to various Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nFigure vii.6: investment in renewables in india since 2014\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: REN 21. Renewables 2022 Global Status Report\n\n7.35  The Central Electricity Authority (CEA) has projected the optimal generation capacity mix to meet the peak electricity demand and electrical energy requirement for 2029-30. The estimate builds in improved efficiency and minimises the total system cost subject to various technical/financial constraints. The likely installed capacity by the end of 2029-30 is expected to be more than 800 GW of which non-fossil fuel would be more than 500 GW.\n\nFigure vii.7: Projected optimal mix of installed capacity for 2029-30\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Central Electricity Authority\n\n* Including hydro imports of 5856 MW\n\n7.36  Moreover,  the  CEA  has  also  estimated  that  the  average  emission  rate  will  decline  by around 29 per cent by 2029-30 compared to 2014-15.\n\nFigure vii.8: Projected fall of average Co 2 emissions rate per kWh of electricity due to significant additions in non-fossil fuel-based installed capacity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Based on data of the Central Electricity Authority\n\n## green hydrogen-a critical source of alternate energy\n\n7.37  From  the  emerging  global  momentum  on  green  hydrogen,  India  can  situate  this decarbonisation opportunity not just within the context of a low-carbon economy but also as an enabler of energy security and economic development for the nation. It will be crucial for achieving  decarbonisation  of  harder-to-abate  sectors  such  as  fertilisers,  refining,  methanol,\n\nmaritime shipping, iron &amp; steel and long-haul transport. Green hydrogen is also an important element of India's Long Term Low Emissions Development Strategy (LT-LEDS).\n\n7.38  With a vision to make India an energy-independent nation, and to de-carbonise critical sectors, the Government approved the National Green Hydrogen Mission on January 4, 2023 with an initial outlay of ₹19,744 crore. The Mission will facilitate demand creation, production, utilisation and export of Green Hydrogen and mobilisation of over ₹8 lakh crore of investment by 2030.\n\n## Figure vii.9: Salient Features of the national green hydrogen mission\n\nSource: Ministry of New &amp; Renewable Energy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n7.39  A report by NITI Aayog 9 in June 2022 shows that in the case of India, renewable tariffs have fallen in recent years, and electrolyser costs are expected to fall in the future.  A recent report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (2020) 10 suggests that the cost of electrolysers is crucial for making green hydrogen economically viable. The report also underscores the importance of innovation in electrolyser technology and the rapid increase in its scale of production as the main factors that would drive down the cost of electrolysers and green hydrogen.\n\n7.40  NITI's report estimates that the cumulative value of the green hydrogen market in India will be US$ 8 billion by 2030 and US$ 340 billion by 2050. The electrolyser market will be approximately US$ 5 billion by 2030 and US$ 31 billion by 2050. In addition, the adoption of green hydrogen will also result in 3.6 Giga tonnes of cumulative CO 2 emission reduction by 2050. This will also generate enormous energy import savings, ensure stability in industry input prices, and strengthen foreign exchange reserves in the long run.\n\n9 'Harnessing Green Hydrogen - Opportunities for Deep Decarbonisation in India', published in June 2022 by NITI Aayog. https://www.niti. gov.in/sites/default/files/202206/Harnessing\\_Green\\_Hydrogen\\_V21\\_DIGITAL\\_29062022.pdf\n\n10 International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) (2020) Green hydrogen cost reduction: Scaling up electrolysers to meet the 1.5 0 C Climate Goal.

This is because an energy system powered by clean energy technologies differs profoundly from one fuelled by traditional hydrocarbon resources. Cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, and rare earth elements (REEs) are critical for producing electric vehicles and batteries and harnessing solar power and wind energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) plants, wind farms and electric vehicles (EVs) generally require more minerals than their fossil fuel-based counterparts. A typical electric car requires six times the mineral inputs of a conventional car, and an onshore wind plant requires nine times more mineral resources than a gas-fired plant 12 .\n\nThe types of mineral resources used vary by technology. Lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese and graphite are crucial to battery performance, longevity and energy density. REEs are essential for permanent magnets that are vital for wind turbines and EV motors. Electricity networks need a huge amount of copper and aluminium, with copper being a cornerstone for all electricity-related technologies.\n\nWhile the demand for critical minerals is set to increase because of the global preference and emphasis towards renewable energy, the global supply chain of the critical minerals is highly concentrated and unevenly distributed. The skewed distribution of the resource poses a supply risk in the face of its enhanced demand.\n\n11 LCOH refers to the cost of hydrogen production per unit of hydrogen includind capital and operational costs.\n\n12 International Energy Agency Report on 'The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions'. The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions - Analysis - IEA\n\nFigure vii.11: Concentration of production of selected minerals in 2019 and 2025\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: International Energy Agency Report on 'The Role of Critical Minerals in Clean Energy Transitions'\n\nA carefully crafted multi-dimensional mineral policy would reduce our dependence and address the problems for the future. The country has resources of nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, and heavy REEs, but further exploration would be needed to evaluate the quantities of their reserves. There is a need to create strategic mineral reserves along the lines of strategic petroleum reserves to ensure a continuous supply of minerals. Also, policies should consider investing in internal research including technological innovation for mineral exploration and processing and the development of Recycling, Reusing, and Repurposing (R3) technologies.\n\nIn order to ensure the mineral security of the nation and to attain self-reliance in the area of critical and strategic minerals, the Ministry of Mines has created a Joint Venture company, namely Khanij Bidesh India Ltd (KABIL), with participating interests of NALCO, HCL and MECL. KABIL is mandated to identify and acquire overseas mineral assets of critical and strategic nature, such as Lithium, Cobalt etc. Further, the Ministry of Mines, Government of India and the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources (DISER), Government of Australia, signed an MoU on June 3, 2020 for cooperation in the field of mining and processing of critical and strategic minerals.  Further, KABIL has also signed a detailed MoU with a collaborative framework with the Critical Minerals Facilitation Office under the DISER on March 10, 2022 to identify lithium and cobalt mineral assets for final joint investment decisions and acquisition of the assets in Australia catering to the critical and strategic ecosystem of both the countries.\n\n## long-term low emissions development Strategy (lt-ledS)\n\n7.42  India  submitted  its  Long-Term  Low  Carbon  Development  Strategy  (LT-LEDS)  on November 14, 2022, at COP 27. The salient features of LT-LEDS are:\n\n- Focus on the rational utilisation of national resources with due regard to energy security. The transitions from fossil fuels will be undertaken in a just, smooth, sustainable and allinclusive manner.\n- Encompasses the objectives of the National Hydrogen Policy. The rapid expansion of green hydrogen production, increasing electrolyser manufacturing capacity in the country, and a\n\nthree-fold increase in nuclear capacity by 2032 are some of the other milestones that are envisaged alongside the overall development of the power sector.\n\n- Increased use of biofuels, especially ethanol blending in petrol. The drive to increase electric vehicle penetration, and the increased use of green hydrogen fuel are expected to drive the low carbon development of the transport sector. India aspires to maximise the use of electric vehicles, ethanol blending to reach 20 per cent by the Ethanol Supply Year 2025-26, and a strong modal shift to public transport for passengers and freight.\n- Climate-resilient  urban  development  will  be  driven  by  smart  city  initiatives,  integrated planning  of  cities  for  mainstreaming  adaptation  and  enhancing  energy  and  resource efficiency, effective green building codes and developments in innovative solid and liquid waste management.\n- India's  industrial  sector  will  continue  on  a  strong  growth  path,  with  the  vision  of  ' Aatmanirbhar Bharat' and ' Make in India' .\n\n7.43  LT-LEDS has been prepared in the framework of India's right to an equitable and fair share of the global carbon budget and is the practical implementation of India's call for 'climate justice.' This is essential to ensure that there are no constraints on realising India's vision of rapid growth and economic transformation while protecting the environment. The LT-LEDS is driven by the vision of LiFE, Lifestyle for the Environment that calls for a worldwide paradigm shift from mindless and destructive consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation. Here, the transition to low carbon development pathway will entail costs. In addition, the provision for climate finance by developed countries will play a very significant role and, therefore, needs to be considerably enhanced in the form of grants and concessional loans.\n\n##",
