# Towards A Healthy Nation

TOWARDS A HEALTHY NATION

11.40 Health  is  a  crucial  component  of  human  capital  and  a  valuable  asset  for  a prosperous  and  stable  economy.  It  boosts  productivity,  reduces  healthcare  needs, enhances life expectancy, and supports social development. Furthermore, good health is  foundational for the young generation to achieve their aspirations and contribute to society. The emphasis on health is important given that India is emerging into an economic powerhouse driven by its youthful population. Through concerted efforts by individuals, communities, and policy interventions, a robust and healthy generation of adults can be raised. Government initiatives, including preventive measures, universal access  to  high-quality  healthcare,  strengthened  public  health  infrastructure,  and advancements in medical education, have collectively contributed to making healthcare in India more accessible and affordable for all.

11.41    A study on the association of government health expenditures (GHE) and health outcomes based on OECD countries shows that health expenditures, economic growth (GDP) and healthcare provision (number of doctors), reduce infant mortality while positively impacting life expectancy. 93 Health expenditures have increased worldwide 94 as it has in India too.

11.42 According to the latest National Health Accounts 95 statistics for 2021-22, released in September 2024, the Total Health Expenditure (THE) 96 in FY22 is estimated to be ₹9,04,461 crore (3.8 per cent of GDP and ₹6,602 per capita at current prices). THE per capita (at constant prices) has shown an increasing trend since FY19.

11.43 Out of the THE, current health expenditure (CHE) 97 is  ₹7,89,760 crore (87.3 per cent of THE), and capital expenditure is ₹1,14,701 crore (12.7 per cent of THE). An increase in the share of capital expenditure in THE from 6.3 per cent in FY16 to 12.7 per cent in FY22 is a positive sign as it will lead to broader and better health infrastructure.

11.44 Government  health  insurance  schemes  constitute  a  5.87  per  cent  share  in healthcare financing schemes, out of which social insurance schemes like Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) 98 , Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) 99 , and Ex-Servicemen Contributory Health Scheme (ECHS) 100  have a 3.24 per cent share. Government-supported voluntary insurance schemes like Ayushman Bharat- Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY), Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), state-specific government health insurance schemes, etc., have a 2.63 per cent share in healthcare financing schemes.

11.45 The increase in government spending on health has an important implication for the reduction of financial hardship endured by households. In the THE of the country between FY15 and FY22, the share of GHE 101 has increased from 29.0 per cent to 48.0

to bottom 40 per cent of India's most vulnerable populations. It covers over 12 crore families,  or  approximately  55  crore  individuals,  and  is  the  world's  largest  health assurance scheme, offering annual hospitalisation benefits of up to ₹5 lakh per family for  secondary  and  tertiary  care.  Launched  to  address  health  inequities,  AB  PMJAY prioritises the poorest segments of the population based on the Socio-Economic Caste Census 2011, adopting a holistic and need-based approach. This initiative aligns with India's commitment to the SDGs, ensuring no one is left behind. As of 1 January 2025, over 36.36 crore Ayushman cards have been issued. Key statistics of AB-PMJAY are given below.

11.48 On 11  September 2024, the expansion of AB PMJAY was approved to include senior citizens aged 70 and above, irrespective of their socio-economic status. This initiative provides free health coverage of up to ₹5 lakh per family, benefiting approximately six crore senior citizens across 4.5 crore families, regardless of income. Eligible seniors will receive a dedicated Vay Vandana Card to access the scheme's benefits. Additionally, those already covered under the scheme will get an exclusive top-up of ₹5 lakh annually for their healthcare needs, separate from their family's coverage. 105  As of 15 January 2025, more than 40 lakh senior citizens have been enrolled the scheme.

11.49 While the government's health initiatives play a crucial role in improving access to  healthcare  and  ultimately  enhancing  health  outcomes  in  the  country,  the  overall health of a population is also affected by other socioeconomic factors. These factors include sanitation, education, nutrition, early child development, and personal habits.

## Transforming healthcare for tomorrow

11.50 Healthcare  infrastructure  is  essential  to  a  functioning  healthcare  system, ensuring access to quality medical services and promoting public health. This includes hospitals,  clinics,  healthcare  professionals,  medical  institutions,  health  centres,  and information technology systems that work collaboratively to provide care.

11.51    Over  the  past  few  decades,  India  has  made  significant  progress  in  health infrastructure,  driven  by  advancements  in  medical  technology  and  expanded  public health programmes. Initiatives like Ayushman Bharat (AB), the PM-Ayushman Bharat

Health  Infrastructure  Mission  (PM-ABHIM),  and  the  Free  Drugs  Service  Initiative (FDSI)  have  transformed  healthcare  delivery.  The  progress  made  in  public  health infrastructure follows.

11.52 Ayushman Bharat: Launched in 2018, AB represents a paradigm shift from selective health services to a comprehensive continuum of care, addressing prevention, promotion, and treatment across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. By  transforming sub-health  centres  (SHCs)  and  primary  health  centres  (PHCs),  Ayushman  Arogya Mandirs (AAM) (formerly Health &amp; Wellness Centres) have been operationalised, 106  in rural and urban areas, offering a universal, free, and expanded package of preventive, promotive, curative, palliative, and rehabilitative services closer to communities.

106  Over 1,75,560 Ayushman Arogya Mandir (AAM) have been operationalised till 31 December 2024.

11.54 FDSI  (2015): To  reduce  OOPE  for  patients  at  public  health  facilities,  the government  launched  the  FDSI  under  the  National  Health  Mission  (NHM).  This provides financial support to states/UTs for ensuring the availability of essential drugs: 106 drugs at SHCs, 172 drugs at PHCs, 300 drugs at CHCs, 318 drugs at Sub-District Hospitals (SDHs), and 381 drugs at district hospitals. The FDSI ensures drug quality by procuring only from Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) certified manufacturers and conducting mandatory post-supply testing of medicines at the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL)-accredited laboratories before distribution.

11.55 Commitment to universal vaccine coverage and health equity: The Universal  Immunisation  Programme  (UIP)  is  one  of  India's  most  impactful  public health initiatives, providing life-saving vaccines to millions of newborns and pregnant women annually. Launched as the Expanded Programme on Immunisation in 1978, it was rebranded as UIP in 1985, extending coverage from urban to rural areas to bridge healthcare disparities.

11.56 Currently, the UIP offers 11 vaccines free of cost, protecting against 12 vaccinepreventable  diseases.  A  child  who  has  received  Bacille  Calmette  Guerin  (BCG), three doses of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV), three doses of Pentavalent and one dose of Measles Rubella (MR) by the first year of age is called a fully immunised child. With full immunisation coverage for FY24 at 93.5 per cent nationally, the UIP continues to safeguard public health and ensure equitable access to essential vaccines.

11.57 The Jan Aushadhi scheme ,  launched to provide affordable medicines, has gained significant momentum, achieving record sales in 2024 and expanding to over 14,000 kendras nationwide. 107  Despite challenges like quality concerns, supply issues, and thin profit margins for pharmacists, the scheme has improved access to low-cost drugs. Awareness campaigns, expanded product offerings like sanitary napkins, and increased rural outreach have boosted its impact, particularly for low-income groups and those  with  chronic  illnesses.  For  example,  Jan  Aushadhi  distributors  in  Kerala reported expecting significant year-on-year turnover growth, driven by the addition of  new  Jan  Aushadhi  Kendra,  expanded  product  offerings,  and  awareness  camps initiated under Pharmaceuticals &amp; Medical Devices Bureau of India and Department of Pharmaceuticals directives. 108 While profitability remains a hurdle for pharmacists and suppliers,  the  growing  demand  by  consumers  highlights  the  enduring  need  for affordable healthcare solutions.

## Disruptive technology providing seamless and equitable healthcare.

11.58 Technology  integration  in  healthcare  delivery  ranges  from  the  utilisation  of wearable devices for timely diagnoses and recommendations of personalised treatments to telehealth technologies that connect patients and health professionals in a virtual space, all aiming to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Public health professionals now have numerous opportunities to implement innovative public health technology solutions to enhance patient care significantly. Some of the initiatives of the MoHFW for the integration of technologies are discussed in this section.

11.59 U-WIN: The U-WIN  portal 109 marks a transformative step in India's immunisation efforts, digitising vaccination records for pregnant women and children up  to  16  years  under  the  UIP.  This  user-friendly  platform  enables  seamless  access to  immunisation  records,  flexible  scheduling,  and  'Anytime  Access'  and  'Anywhere' vaccination.  Beneficiaries  can  self-register  via  the  web  portal  or  mobile  app,  track schedules,  and  receive  SMS  reminders  for  upcoming  doses.  U-WIN  also  generates QR-based e-vaccination certificates and facilitates the creation of Ayushman Bharat Health Accounts (ABHA) for parents and children, supporting holistic digital health management. The portal is accessible in 11 regional languages. 110 Over 1.7 crore pregnant women and 5.4 crore children are registered digitally and tracked more than 26.4 crore vaccine doses in real-time. 111

11.60 E-Sanjeevani: E-Sanjeevani - the National Telemedicine Service, has emerged as  the  world's  largest  telemedicine  implementation  in  primary  healthcare.  It  has served over 31.19 crore patients through 1.29 lakh AAM as spokes, which are served by 16,447 hubs and 676 online OPDs with support of more than 225,286 doctors, medical specialists, super-specialists and health workers (Figures are as on 12 November 2024).

11.61 Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM): Launched in September 2021 with the aim of creating a national digital health ecosystem, it supports universal health coverage and is the necessary backbone for an integrated digital health infrastructure in the country.

11.62 The integration and use of technology have the potential to offer viable solutions to problems of quality, accessibility, and affordability. One such example is the potential to prevent loss of lives and save time by leveraging drones for the delivery of medicines in difficult geographies and in times of emergencies ( Box XI.9 ).

## Box XI.9: Aerial angels: Changing the healthcare landscape

Drones  are  transforming  healthcare  in  India  by  ensuring  rapid  delivery  of  life-saving medicines and collecting samples from remote and inaccessible areas, proving indispensable during emergencies. Their ability to navigate diverse terrains, such as roads, water bodies, forests,  and  high-rise  buildings,  makes  them  highly  effective  and  reliable  in  the  most challenging conditions making it crucial in emergencies, potentially preventing the loss of lives.

The WEF launched the project 'Medicines from the Sky' in collaboration with the government of Telangana in September 2021 in the Vikarabad district in Telangana. This programme was the first of its kind in Asia to deliver medicines and jabs to test the feasibility of mediumrange delivery options. 112  Later, in 2022, the project was carried out in Arunachal Pradesh with the aim of analysing the response of the state's healthcare system when integrated with drones. As of October 2024, the key progress highlights for Arunachal Pradesh 113  are:

It was observed that the delivery times had drastically improved, with trips reduced from eight hours by ground transport to just 22 minutes by drone, cutting emergency response times and saving lives in critical situations. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) recognised the project's achievements for its innovative use of drones to enhance health supply chains in the region.

Drones  have  significant  potential  to  deliver  essential  goods  to  vulnerable  populations, helping to overcome access barriers and facilitating faster delivery of lifesaving medicines.

## Advancing healthcare through AI

11.63 The  National  Strategy  for  Artificial  Intelligence  (2018)  developed  by  NITI Aayog  discussed  how  AI  could  help  address  the  challenges  of  quality,  accessibility, and affordability for a large section of the population. The strategy emphasised how AI combined with robotics and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) can potentially become  the  'new  nervous  system  for  healthcare',  providing  solutions  to  address healthcare problems and helping the government achieve universal health for all. 117

11.64 As per NASSCOM, the widespread adoption of AI in healthcare can create new opportunities for the sector and bridge the accessibility, affordability, and quality gaps. 118 Adoption of AI can help reduce drug discovery and delivery costs; it can improve the quality of medical devices, improve diagnosis accuracy and enable real-time monitoring of remote patients. For healthcare providers, AI helps streamline the overall patient journey, assists clinicians in reducing misdiagnoses, and  enables personalised treatments and preventive care. One of the use case examples of how AI can efficiently deliver services and enhance the accessibility of healthcare for citizens are presented in Box XI.10 .

## Box XI.10: Use of Tele-Radiology and AI in silicosis management

Silicosis is a debilitating lung disease caused by inhaling silica dust. It is associated with severe comorbidities such as tuberculosis, cancer, ischemic heart disease, bronchitis, and infections from bacteria and fungi.

The Rajasthan state government has set a new benchmark in public health management of this disease, which is widespread in the state due to sandstone mining activities. 119 The state  government  is  effectively  using  digital  X-rays,  tele-radiology,  and  AI  to  streamline the  diagnosis  of  Silicosis.  The  technology  was  developed  by  training  an  AI  model  on  a vast  dataset  of  over-labelled  chest  X-rays.  By  leveraging  AI  technology,  the  government enabled the automatic detection of the disease, making the diagnostic process faster and more accurate. This technology has significantly improved the identification and treatment of  Silicosis  patients.  The  government  also  introduced  DBT  self-approval  portal,  which allows diagnosed patients to receive financial assistance directly into their bank accounts, bypassing the previously cumbersome administrative procedures. 120  This system ensures that those affected by Silicosis receive timely relief.

11.65 Another example of technology integration in health care is the eSwasthya Dham portal 121  launched by the Uttarakhand Government. 122  The portal helps monitor the Char Dham Yatra pilgrim's (Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath, and Badrinath-together called as the Char Dham Yatra) health parameters and offers a variety of benefits for pilgrims, including the ability to generate an ABHA in under two minutes. Creating the ABHA, helps provide a reliable and secure identity for devotees, enabling them to manage their health records digitally. This system will also ensure prompt assistance for citizens in case of emergencies. As a result, it facilitates the smooth journey of pilgrims.

11.66 Despite its  great  potential,  AI  adoption  in  India  is  still  in  its  early  stages.  In 2023, 34 per cent of healthcare organisations in India were piloting AI projects, and 16 per cent had moved their generative AI initiatives into production. However, the adoption  of  AI  in  the  Indian  healthcare  sector  faces  several  challenges,  including  a lack of specialised talent (both technical and domain-specific), data complexities, and difficulties in scaling up. 123  This requires attention going forward.

## The Impact of lifestyle and work culture on mental well-being

11.67 Mental well-being is often conflated with happiness or mood.  However, it is beyond that. It is  the  ability  to  navigate  life's  challenges  and  function  productively.

Mental  well-being  encompasses  all  our  mental-emotional,  social,  cognitive,  and physical capabilities. This can also be construed as the mind's composite health.

11.68  The Economic Survey 2023-24 recognised mental well-being as an economic issue and highlighted, in some detail, the increasing prevalence of mental health issues worldwide and in India and its likely impact on the economy. It emphasised a whole of community approach to tackling mental health problems. In this Survey, we take the discussion forward.

11.69  Data suggests that mental well-being is not static; indeed, there are a myriad of factors, including workplace culture, hours spent working, and lifestyle, that influence mental  well-being.  This  section  presents  the  results  of  a  short  survey  conducted  to understand how lifestyle, work culture, family bonds, eating habits, etc., are affecting the  mental  health  of  citizens  in  the  country.  Although  a  few  prior  surveys  have been conducted to assess mental health in India 124 , they do not allow us to have this understanding. 125

11.70 Since 2021, the Sapien Labs Centre for Human Brain and Mind (the Centre), India 126 ,  has  been  collecting data on a comprehensive measure of mental well-being from over 150,000 internet-enabled individuals in India. The data is dynamic; each month, an additional sample of about 2,000-3,000 individuals residing in India gets added to the database. In the months of October and November of 2024, a special survey  focused  on  understanding  the  impact  of  work  culture,  family  bonds,  eating habits, pastimes, and exercise on mental well-being and productivity was conducted by the Centre. This survey was conducted online on 5,233 digitally-enabled individuals between 18-64 years of age. 127

11.71   The Centre uses a comprehensive measure of mental well-being that explicitly accounts for an individual's ability to function and is not based on a symptom-based assessment that has been widely used previously. The measurement utilises the MHQ or  Mental Health Quotient assessment that evaluates 47 aspects of mental function spanning six dimensions (Chart XI.9.a) .  These aspects include both mental health

11.72 Work  culture  comprises  the  myriad  of  factors  that  define  an  individual's experience at work, including work amount/load, manager and peer relationships, and perceived control. Global data 131 , mirrored in India, suggests that work culture strongly impacts mental well-being. In the survey, workers employed in the formal economy in India were asked to rate various work factors on a scale from 1 to 9, where one was the worst, and nine was the best.

11.73 Individuals with the best manager and colleague relationships report a 100-point higher  (or  33  per  cent 132 )  mental  well-being  score  compared  to  their  counterparts working  with  the  worst  manager/peer  relationships.  Similarly,  those  reporting  the best  workload report 80 points or 27 per cent greater mental well-being than their counterparts with the worst workload.

11.74 Further,  individuals  who  report  the  best  pride  and  purpose  at  work  have  a 100-point greater mental well-being score (0r 33 per cent) and a 120-point (40 per cent) greater well-being score than those who report the worst. In addition, individuals in  fully  remote  work  situations  have  a  mental  well-being  score  about  50  points (17 per cent) lower than counterparts in either fully in-person or hybrid work models, suggesting that social interaction at work is essential to preserve mental well-being.

11.75 While the hours spent at work are informally considered a measure of productivity, a previous study has documented adverse health effects when hours exceed 55-60 per week. 133  Spending long hours at one's desk is equally detrimental to mental well-being. Individuals who spend 12 or more hours at a desk have distressed/struggling levels of mental well-being, with a mental well-being score approximately 100 points lower than those who spend less than or equal to two hours at a desk, according to the survey.

11.76   While promoting a better workplace culture will lead to better mental well-being, lifestyle choices and family situations also play a significant role. Results of the survey show that individuals who rarely consume ultra-processed or packaged junk food have better  mental  well-being  than  those  who  regularly  do.    Similarly,  those  who  rarely exercise, spend their free time on social media or are not close to their families have worse mental well-being. (Chart XI.10)

132 Since  MHQ  is  calculated  on  a  300-point  scale  (-100  to  +200),  a  100  point  higher  score  translates  into  a (100/300)*100=33 percent.

## Chart XI.10 Mental Well-Being and Lifestyle

<!-- image -->

11.77  While the low levels of mental well-being are worrying, the ramifications of these trends on the economy are equally disturbing. Chart XI.11 shows that individuals with well-being scores between -100 and -50 are unable to work about 15 days a month, while those with scores between 100 and 150 are unable to work three days a month, and those with scores about 150 are unable to work only two days a month.  In addition to impacting mental well-being and lifestyle, the workplace culture also affects productivity.

11.78 The  survey  results  show  the  extent  to  which  lifestyle  choices  and  workplace culture are associated with the number of days an individual is unable to work/month. 134 Better lifestyle choices/workplace cultures and family relationships are associated with 2-3 fewer days lost per month at work. Having poor relationships with managers and low (worst) pride and purpose at work are associated with the largest increases in the number of days one is unable to work. The findings also suggest that multiple factors affect productivity. For example, even in jobs with the best managerial relationships, about 5 days per month are lost. This is because workplace culture is but one factor (among several) in the determination of productivity (and mental well-being). A study 135 by the WHO finds that globally, about 12 billion days are lost annually due to depression and anxiety, amounting to a financial loss of $1 trillion. In rupee terms, this translates to about ₹7,000 per day.

134  Self-reported measure of productivity is used.

11.79 Lifestyle choices and workplace culture are critical for mental well-being and, hence,  productivity.  If  India's  economic  ambitions  are  to  be  met,  then  immediate attention  must  be  given  to  lifestyle  choices  that  are  often  made  during  childhood/ youth. 136  Furthermore, hostile work cultures and excessive hours spent working at the desk can adversely affect mental well-being and ultimately put the brakes on the pace of economic growth. 137

11.80   The increase in mental health issues in children and adolescents is often linked to the overuse of the internet and, specifically, social media. Jonathan Haidt, in his book ' The Anxious Generation: How the great rewiring of children is causing an epidemic of mental illness ', which has now been voted as the book of the year by Goodreads, 138 provides a researched assessment of adolescent mental health. He suggests that the arrival of the 'phone-based childhood' is rewiring the very experience of growing up. The recent announcements by government of Australia to ban the use of social media by children below 16 years of age is a testimony to the gravity of the situation. Similar interventions are being discussed in Sweden and Spain, as per news report. 139

11.81   While these interventions at government level are being contemplated, there is an urgent need for school and family-level interventions to encourage healthy pastimes (meeting with friends, playing outside). Investing time in building close family bonds would go a long way towards keeping children and adolescents away from internet and

137    A caveat to these findings is that the data used here is only from the digitally-enabled population. Google and Facebook ads were used to recruit respondents to take the MHQ survey.  It is therefore possible that the data are skewed towards those for whom mental health is a problem who took the survey to know their mental wellbeing score. However, this worry is not completely justified since the sample also includes individuals with good mental health scores- over 30 per cent report MHQ scores 100 or higher placing them in the succeeding/ thriving  range.  Finally,  the  associations  shown  here-of  lifestyle  and  work  culture  on  mental  well-being  and productivity cannot strictly be interpreted as a causal effect.

improving mental well-being. In many ways, returning to our roots may allow us to reach further for the skies in terms of mental health.

11.82 In summary, given the direct costs to human welfare and the spirit and sentiment of the nation, putting mental well-being at the centre of the economic agenda is prudent. The scale of the problem is immense as discussed in the Economic Survey 2023-24 (Chapter 7, para 7.28). Post-facto treatment will not be sufficient. It is about time to find  viable,  impactful  preventive  strategies  and  interventions.  India's  demographic dividend is riding on skills, education, physical health and, above all, mental health of its youth.

11.83 Recognising this, the government is committed to creating an accessible and inclusive mental health ecosystem. The Economic Survey 2023-24 (Chapter 7, Table VII.3)  highlighted  various  initiatives  aimed  at  addressing  mental  health  and  wellbeing.  The  National  Mental  Health  Policy,  2014  provides  an  overarching  vision  for mental health in the country. The Mental Healthcare Act, 2017 lays down a rights-based framework for accessible and dignified mental health services. Currently, 47 Mental Health  Institutes  are  operational  across  the  country.  Additionally,  the  government supports mental health services at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels under the National Mental Health Program. A dedicated Tele-MANAS Cell at the Armed Forces Medical  College,  Pune,  supports  Armed  Forces  personnel  and  their  dependents. The  Tele-MANAS  Mobile  Application,  launched  on  10  October  2024,  provides  a comprehensive mental health mobile platform. Additionally, video consultations on Tele MANAS have been initially rolled out in Karnataka, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, and Tamil Nadu and will be scaled nationwide.

## Impact of lifestyle choices on health

11.84 An individual's lifestyle, encompassing habits like diet, sleep, device use, and exercise, profoundly impacts overall well-being.  This section discusses the crucial role of lifestyle on an individual's health.

11.85 According to WHO, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the reason behind the death of 41 million people each year, equivalent to 74 per cent of all deaths globally. Of all NCD deaths, 77 per cent are in low- and middle-income countries. 140  The burden of NCD risk factors arises partly from population growth and ageing.

11.86 According to the 2017 study report 'India: Health of the Nation's States' by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the proportion of deaths due to NCDs in India increased from 37.9 per cent in 1990 to 61.8 per cent in 2016. The four major NCDs are cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), and

diabetes. These diseases share four common behavioural risk factors: unhealthy diet, lack of physical activity, tobacco use, and alcohol consumption. 141

11.87 Recognising the growing NCD challenge, the MoHFW launched the National Programme  for  Prevention  and  Control  of  NCD  (NP-NCD),  the  erstwhile  National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, and  Stroke  (NPCDCS).  The  programme  has  significantly  strengthened  healthcare infrastructure,  decentralising  services  and  ensuring  quality  care  reaches  rural  and remote areas.

11.88 Population-Based  Screening  (PBS)  initiative: To  enhance  early  NCD detection, the government launched the PBS initiative targeting individuals aged 30 and above for screening for common NCDs. The National NCD portal 142 , introduced in 2018, manages patient data and integrates health records with ABHA IDs. As on date, 42.2 crore individuals enrolled (aged more than 30 years), and 39.80 crore individuals were  screened  for  diabetes,  hypertension,  and  common  cancers,  enabling  timely interventions, and reducing long-term healthcare burdens.

11.89 Among other factors, lifestyle choices play a crucial role in the prevention of NCDs. 143   Reducing  excess  calorie  intake  and  improving  dietary  quality  may  help prevent many primary and secondary cardiovascular events. 144  The section on mental well-being discussed how the intake of ultra-processed food (UPFs) is associated with mental well-being. Box XI.11 dwells on the impact of intake of UPF on the physical health of an individual.

diet. The NOVA food classification system 145 , 146  categorises UPFs broadly as ready-to-eat products characterised as industrial formulations composed of substances extracted from food, along with additives for taste enhancement. These foods are generally energy-rich with high levels of sugar, salt and unsaturated fats and are nutrient deficient as they are made from ingredients derived from a limited variety of crops such as wheat or soy.

The National Dietary Guideline 2024 147  identifies UPFs as food and beverage products that have  undergone extensive  industrial  processing  and  contain  a  high  number  of  additives such as preservatives, sweeteners, emulsifiers, and other substances that are not commonly used in culinary preparations.

Convenience, hyper palatability, affordability, longer shelf life and vigorous advertising and marketing strategies have made a conducive environment for the thriving business of UPFs in India. WHO India 148 , reports that, between 2011 and 2021, the value of retail sales in the UPF segment grew at a CAGR of 13.7 per cent. Though there was a YoY growth rate decline from 12.7 per cent to 5.5 per cent during 2020, the very next year, it was 11.29 per cent. According to the HCES 2022-23, almost 9.6 per cent of the food budget in rural areas and 10.64 per cent in urban areas is spent on beverages, refreshments, and processed food. 149

There is enough research to show that the shift in dietary practices from unprocessed to semi-processed and to UPF items exposes an individual to a wide range of adverse health outcomes ranging from obesity, chronic inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and mental disorders. 150,151,152  Being lower in fibre content, UPFs are observed to lead to weight gain and obesity in adults and children. 153,154,155  Studies from across countries show a

146    NOVA Food Classification system, which was designed by Center for Epidemiological Studies in Health and Nutrition, School of Public Health, University of Sao Paulo, Brazil. NOVA helps people 'group foods according to the extent and purpose of the processing they undergo. The NOVA system classifies foods into four categories: (i) NOVA1 includes unprocessed or minimally processed foods, (ii) NOVA2 comprises culinary ingredients (iii) NOVA3 covers processed foods, and (iv) NOVA4 includes ultra-processed foods.

direct association between exposure to UPFs and 32 health parameters spanning mortality, cancer,  and  mental,  respiratory,  cardiovascular,  gastrointestinal,  and  metabolic  health outcomes.  They  also  indicate  that  greater  exposure  to  UPFs  leads  to  anxiety  outcomes, mental disorder outcomes, prevalent adverse sleep-related outcomes, heart disease-related mortality, type 2 diabetes, depressive outcomes, wheezing, obesity, and cancer and higher risks  of  mortality. 156,157 Further,  there  are  also  evidences  that  UPFs  may  hamper  with immunity and may lead to increasing gut impermeability and can cause bacterial imbalance in the gut, with adverse implications to immunity. 158 Increased and frequent  consumption of UPF is associated with an increased risk of multimorbidity, which refers to the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions due to non-communicable diseases for an extended period of time. 159

Historically,  the  correlation  between  poor  dietary  intake  and  adverse  mental  health  has been documented. There is growing evidence that the level of food processing influences dietary  quality  and  impacts  mental  health. 160 Studies  also  substantiate  that  increased consumption  of  UPF  has  an  adverse  impact  on  the  mental  well-being  of  children  and adolescents. 161  Multiple studies link highly processed food with low mood, depression, and anxiety. Increased frequency of intake of UPF impacts mental health function, including cognition, adaptability, and resilience. Also, they can lead to depression, anxiety, and longterm psychological distress. 162,163

India has made strides in addressing its growing disease burden as a result of UPF through notable interventions such as Advertising and Claims Regulations, 2018; School Children Regulation, 2020; and the Food Safety and Standards (Labelling and Display) Regulations, 2020. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019 addresses the issue of lack of a clear definition of  misleading  advertisement and prescribes fines for such advertising of unhealthy food products.

To date, much of the policy and public messaging about 'unhealthy food' or the regulations have focused on specific nutrients-saturated fats, sodium, and sugar.

## The Way Forward

The huge business of UPF segments has been built on hyper palatability of food items and marketing strategies involving misleading advertisements and celebrity endorsements targeting consumer behaviour. Often unhealthy packaged food items are advertised and marketed as healthy products. For example, breakfast cereals, tetra pack juices and chocolate malt drinks, often advertised as healthy and nutritious, come under the category of UPF based on their ingredients. Misleading nutrition claims and information on UPFs need to be tackled and should be brought under the scanner. Setting standards for permissible levels of salt and sugar and ensuring checks for UPF brands to adhere to the regulations are also required.

Many countries, including Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Mexico, Israel, Peru, the UK and Uruguay, have been implementing the Nutrient Profile Model for labelling and restricting marketing as proposed by the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) in 2016. In 2011, Denmark introduced a tax on saturated food products. 164  Mexico has imposed a surcharge on carbonated drinks and a tax on junk food. 165

Making consumers conscious about what they eat, its ingredients and associated side effects is important not only to counter the intake of UPF but also to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Understanding the ingredients of packaged food, the ill effects of UPF, and healthy food choices should be a part of the school curriculum. Since UPF brands often target children and adolescents, massive awareness of the potential risk factors of UPF is of utmost necessity. Generating health-conscious consumers can further motivate and incentivise various UPF brands to come up with healthy alternatives or minimise the extent of the negative effects of  the  UPFs. This calls forth for enormous behaviour change campaigns and awarenessgenerating sessions. Efforts also need to be directed to promote local and seasonal fruits and vegetables and facilitate positive subsidies for healthy foods such as whole foods, millet, fruits, and vegetables to improve their availability, affordability, and consumption.

A study by Nutrition Advocacy in Public Interest (NAPi)/Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI) 2023 recommended that efforts to curb the harmful impact of UPFs should be free from food industry influence. The MoHFW should urgently define nutrient thresholds for  sugars,  salt,  and  saturated  fats  to  regulate  advertising,  adopt  warning  front-of-pack labels  (FOPL),  and  impose  stricter  marketing  restrictions  on  unhealthy  foods,  especially targeting children under 18. Schools, hospitals, and public areas should eliminate UPFs, while incentives should promote affordable healthy food production. High GST rates and amendments to consumer protection laws could deter misleading advertising. Additionally, a coalition of civil society and government entities, free from conflicts of interest, is vital to educate the public and counter food industry interference. 166

The government has been making dedicated efforts to promote healthy foods and an active lifestyle by implementing initiatives such as Eat Right India 167  and Fit India Movement. 168 By prioritising whole, minimally processed foods rich in nutrients, fibre, and essential vitamins, individuals can lower their consumption of unhealthy additives, excess sugar, and refined grains often found in processed foods. This proactive shift not only enhances physical health but also supports mental clarity and sustained energy.

A multi-pronged approach would be required to address the concerns emerging from the increased inclusion of UPFs in diets in India. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of  India  (FSSAI)  could  consider  bringing  UPFs  under  regulation  with  a  clear  definition and standards, including stricter labelling requirements. Improved monitoring of branded products to ensure compliance would help build consumer confidence. A 22-country study established  that  self-regulation  has  not  been  very  effective  in  this  regard. 169 ,170 Further, consumer protection  efforts  can  be  strengthened  to  deal  with  aggressive  marketing  and distribution practices and misleading nutrition claims in advertising, especially when they are targeted towards children and youth. A higher tax rate for UPFs may also be considered as a 'health tax' measure targeted specifically at brands/products that advertise. There is a need to generate greater awareness of the adverse impact of the consumption of UPFs through campaigns targeted at schools and colleges alongside existing health and lifestyle campaigns of the governments.

## RURAL ECONOMY

11.90   The government's emphasis has been on improving the quality of life in rural areas  to  ensure  more  equitable  and  inclusive  development.  Various  measures  have been taken in this regard by focusing on infrastructure encompassing rural housing, drinking  water  and  sanitation,  clean  fuel,  social  protection,  and  rural  connectivity, along with enhancing rural livelihoods. The financing needs of rural households and small businesses are being met through microfinance institutions, SHGs, and other financial  intermediaries.  Taking  digitisation  and  technology  to  the  rural  economy has  also  been  a  key  aspect  of  the  rural  development  agenda,  be  it  in  agricultural activities or governance. For instance, the emphasis on digital land records through SVAMITVA shows a structural shift in rural land management and individual economic empowerment. A primary focus has also been on the health parameters of the rural population, with enhanced emphasis necessitated by the pandemic.

11.92 For  the  development  of  Particularly  Vulnerable  Tribal  Group  (PVTG)  under Pradhan  Mantri  Janjati  Adivasi  Nyaya  Maha  Abhiyan  (PM-JANMAN),  a  separate vertical has been launched under PMGSY by relaxing the population norms upto 100 to provide the connectivity to unconnected PVTG habitations. A total of 8,000 Km of Road length is targeted to be constructed under this vertical. The implementation period is till March 2028.  A total of 1,557 road works of 4,781.44 Km of road length have been sanctioned till 9 January 2025.

## Rural Housing: A Milestone for identity and economic growth

11.93 For most families in India, owning a house is both a milestone and a leap in living standards, especially for the rural poor, where it signifies identity and well-being. Beyond meeting basic needs, rural housing drives local employment and the economy and serves as a durable credit asset that enhances family welfare.

11.94 Providing housing for economically deprived rural households has long been integral  to  India's  development  strategy.  Aligning  with  SDG  Goal  11.1  on  'Safe  and affordable housing' and India's vision of 'Housing for All,' the Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin (PMAY-G) was launched on 1 April 2016. The Government of India has approved Phase-IV of PMGSY to provide all-weather connectivity to 25,000 rural habitations  based  on  the  population  criteria  of  Census  2011.  The  PMGSY-IV  will incorporate international benchmarks and good practices in road construction. The survey of habitations has started through GIS based App. The PM Gati Shakti is being utilized to plan and implement the programme. Box XI.12 discusses the outcomes of PMAY-G, which is not merely providing housing but also many attended benefits that the scheme is bringing to the lives of the rural people.

## Box XI.12: The many outcomes of Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana-Gramin

PMAY-G aims to provide a pucca house with basic amenities to all houseless families and families living in kutcha and dilapidated houses in rural areas by 2029. The construction of 2.69 crore houses has been completed with support under the scheme since 2016. The scheme has been extended to construct an additional two crore rural houses over the next five  years,  i.e.  till  2029. 178 Holistic  design  and  efficient  implementation  elements  of  the scheme have contributed to its success.

The target  beneficiary  identification  is  made  on  the  basis  of  a  waitlist  derived  from  the Socio-Economic Caste Census, 2011 and Awaas+ survey, 2018, done for this purpose and then  verified  by  the  Gram  Sabhas.  Recently,  the  number  of  objective  exclusion  criteria used for the identification of beneficiaries has been reduced from 13 to 10 (ownership of a fishing boat or motorised two-wheeler, raising the income threshold to ₹15,000 per month were removed) to enhance inclusivity in the target group. The Awaas+ survey, 2024 is also underway to verify eligible beneficiaries.

The  scheme  operates  on  the  DBT  model,  where  assistance  is  credited  directly  into  the beneficiary's  bank  account,  and  construction  work  is  monitored  through  geo-tagged photographs. Evaluation study (National Institute for Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), July 2019 179 )  shows that the introduction of DBT, as well as geotagging, has reduced the levels of administrative clearances required and the time taken for funds to be released as verification became more efficient. It improves fund utilisation of the scheme as it reduces leakages. DBT under the scheme has improved financial inclusion in rural areas (NIPFP, Dec 2019 180 ).

PAHAL - a repository of designs of housing typologies that are suitable to different regions/ states has been developed and made available to the beneficiaries. These designs incorporate elements of disaster resilience, the use of eco-friendly local materials and skills, the use of cost-effective technologies etc. A rural mason training programme has been developed in partnership with the Construction Skill Development Council of India (CSDCI) and the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC) and launched as part of the scheme to improve the availability of skilled/trained masons in rural areas for construction under the scheme and other works. So far 2,86,843 181 masons have been trained and certified.  With the above measures on average, the time taken for the construction of one unit has improved to 114 days under PMAY-G from 314 days under IAY. 182

The scheme has been a source of employment for labourers, masons, and artisans. The construction of a house under PMAY-G generates direct employment of approximately 314

person-days, which includes 81 skilled, 71 semi-skilled, and 164 unskilled person-days. The  total  direct  employment  generated  for  houses  completed  in  the  first  two  years  of the scheme was 4.82 crore person days for skilled labour and 7.60 crore person days for unskilled labour (NIPFP, 2018 183 ). Extrapolating the estimates, it is seen that more than 192 crore man-days of skilled labour and almost 250 crore man-days of unskilled labour could have been employed since 2016. The study also shows that indirect employment from the backward and forward linkages to construction activities is considerable and beneficial to the rural economy.

The  AwaasSoft  MIS  and  AwaasApp  enable  the  implementation  of  all  functions  and transactions  of  the  scheme  and  evidence-based  monitoring.  This  is  open  to  the  public, allowing  more  transparency.  The  use  of  emerging  technologies,  such  as  AI/ML-based object detection in house images and geo-referencing, enhances transparency and enables better deduplication of PMAY-G assets. Additionally, an eKYC app integrated with Aadhaar and equipped with AI-enabled face authentication technology is used to verify PMAY-G beneficiaries.

The scheme reserves a minimum of 60 per cent of targets for SC/ST households, with 59.58 lakh SC houses and 58.57 lakh ST houses completed. Five per cent of the target is reserved for differently-abled beneficiaries, and another five per cent prioritises housing for families affected by natural disasters.  Scheme has placed a special focus on women's empowerment, with 74 per cent of sanctioned houses owned by women solely or jointly.

PMAY-G converges with schemes like MGNREGA 184 , SBM-G, Jal Jeevan Mission, and Surya Ghar , ensuring beneficiaries access to water, toilets, LPG, electricity, and solar energy. An evaluation shows that the ease of living of beneficiaries is enhanced due to the construction of  the  house  and  88  per  cent  of  respondents  confirmed  improvements  in  the  standard of  living  with  the  construction  of  houses. 185 The  scheme  is  one  of  the  key  interventions facilitating SDG achievements, specifically in terms of the percentage of households living in kuccha houses. 186

## Localising SDGs: Powering rural progress

11.95 Localisation  of  SDGs  ensures  that  rural  development  aligns  with  global goals,  addressing  basic  amenities  such  as  housing,  sanitation,  water  supply,  and electrification. This approach drives inclusive growth and improved quality of life at the grassroots level. SDGs localisation is being pursued at the Gram Panchayat (GP) level through  Village  Panchayat  Development  Plans  under  Mission  Antyodaya 187 and  the

Transformation of Aspirational Districts Programme (TADP), adopted in 2018 188 with districts as the lowest level of implementation. Accelerating forward, the preparation for a Local Indicator Framework (LIF) at the GP level is already in the process where nine themes have been designed spanning across the 17 SDGs. Box XI.13 discusses these initiatives.

## Box XI.13: Localisation of Sustainable Development Goals

The adoption of 17 SDGs in 2015 marked a paradigm shift in how the world understood and prepared itself to pursue the development agenda. India continues to wholeheartedly accept, engage, and progress with the idea of SDG implementation. Our timely submission of Voluntary National Reviews of 2017, 2020 and 2023 189 and the adoption of the SDG Index 190 reflects India's commitment to the cause. The call for 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' and the vision of Viksit Bharat by 2047 lays the roadmap for achieving the SDGs.

A  'whole-of-the-government'  strategy  with  an  emphasis  on  cooperative  and  competitive federalism  among  states  is  being  followed.    The  'collaborative  competition'  approach, supported by comparative rankings on SDG progress, has generated momentum among states and complements the strategy.

There is a global shift towards the 'localisation' of SDGs to achieve the goals by 2030 and increase the rate and impact of progress. SDG localisation is the process of adapting and customising these goals and translating them into local development plans and strategies that fit the needs, context and priorities of a particular region or locality in coherence with national frameworks (United Nations, 2024). 191 This approach places local communities at the centre of sustainable development and anchors development action on the principles of subsidiarity, inclusion, partnership and multilevel governance, with adequate data and financing availability at the local level.

In India, state governments have been proactive and have laid out strategies and frameworks for  achieving  SDGs  at  various  administrative  levels.  Some  states  have  extended  their indicator frameworks to the district and block levels, ensuring that local budgets align with SDG objectives. This multi-layered approach to SDG implementation is based on the Indian model of SDG Localisation 192 comprising four key pillars: creating institutional ownership, fostering collaborative competition, enhancing capacities, and embracing a whole-of-society approach.

## Kerala offers a replicable model for SDG localisation.

Kerala uses a robust, community-based model that leverages its strong local governance institutions.  Awareness and community engagement efforts focus on educating local officials on the relevance of poverty alleviation and environmental resilience, which are led by state and  national  leaders.  The  Local  Self  Government  Department,  with  technical  support from the Kerala Institute for Local Administration (KILA), have developed comprehensive guidelines and processes to incorporate SDGs into local planning. They also train stakeholders in SDG-aligned development and data collection. The state has a real-time SDG dashboard to monitor the panchayats and is able to use such localised data for decision-making and to provide insights on development indicators.

Localisation efforts are driven by the   SDG Coordination Centres (SDGCCs) in states and UTs by governments in partnership with implementing agencies.  Currently, SDGCCs are operational in 10 states/UTs, namely Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Karnataka, Nagaland, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. These  centres  play  a  pivotal  role  in  supporting  and  facilitating  implementation  on  the ground.  This  is  achieved  through  integrated  policymaking,  fostering  interlinkages  and synergies, establishing monitoring systems, adopting a convergence-based approach, and fostering participation at all levels of government among all stakeholders.

Over the past six years, the SDGCCs have established a strong foundation for understanding and ownership of the SDGs at the state level. With all levels of government fully committed to achieving the SDGs, there has been a shift in departmental mindsets towards adopting result-based, integrated planning. Through continuous training and handholding support, departments  are  increasingly  aligning  their  efforts  with  outcome-linked  planning  and budgeting. This evolution has fostered evidence-based decision-making and the identification of viable solutions, to reach the most vulnerable population first, realising the principle of 'Leaving No One Behind'.

NITI Aayog is transitioning to SDG Coordination and Acceleration Centres (SDGCACs) 193 as we approach the 2030 deadline. The SDGCACs will uphold the current SDGCC approach while  encouraging  innovative  solutions,  scaling  up  successful  initiatives  and  fostering synergistic  collaborations  among  diverse  stakeholders.  They  aim  to  (a)  go  beyond  the planning  department  and  intensify  engagement  with  other  key  departments,  especially the finance department (b) go beyond the whole of the government approach and foster the  whole  of  the  society  approach  for  the  systematic  and  sustained  participation  of  civil society organisations (CSOs) and private sectors and (c) have an interconnected approach to challenges by identifying critical actors and working towards a collaboration.

In conclusion, the localisation of SDGs ensures that rural development is in harmony with international goals, focusing on essential services like housing, sanitation, water supply, and electrification. This strategy promotes inclusive growth and enhances the quality of life at the grassroots level.

193 SDGCCs  are  Specialised  Project  Management  Units  within  State  Government  departments  of  Planning, Economics and Statistics or Finance to align the planning process with the SDGs. (https://sdgknowledgehub. undp.org.in/sdgcc/ )

## Other measures towards rural welfare

11.96 Food,  Nutrition,  Health,  and  WASH  (FNHW): To  address  health, nutrition, WASH, and sanitation issues, DAY-NRLM implements FNHW interventions, focusing on promoting the consumption of produce from nutri-gardens, poultry, small ruminants, and dairy. Currently, FNHW interventions are being implemented in 5369 blocks across 682 districts. 194

11.97 Social Inclusion and Gender: State  Rural  Livelihoods  Missions  (SRLMs) have  developed  state-specific  strategies  to  integrate  DAY-NRLM  components  and community  institutions,  addressing  issues  such  as  child  education,  early  marriage, asset  creation  for  women,  and  violence  against  women.  Currently,  32  SRLMs  are implementing these gender interventions.

11.98 Gender Resource Centres (GRCs) are being established to address gender issues at the local level, supported by Gender Point Persons (GPPs) who sensitise SHG members on gender-based violence and discrimination. GPPs are trained by Gender Community Resource Persons (Gender-CRPs), who build capacity in both SHG members and the wider community.

11.99 Over 25 lakh GPPs and more than 89,000 Gender-CRPs work within more than 31,000 Cluster Level Federations (CLFs) and 5,00,000 Village Organisations (VOs), tackling gender issues with the support of 40,061 GP-level Gender Forums and 1927 Block-level Gender Forums. A total of 3997 GRCs are operating across 18 States and UTs under DAY-NRLM, empowering women and gender-diverse persons to address violence and access their rights.

It operates through legal service institutions from the Taluk Court to the Supreme Court, offering services such as legal aid, advice, awareness programmes, Lok Adalats, and the Victim Compensation Scheme.

11.101  Additionally, the government has launched the 'Designing Innovative Solutions for Holistic Access to Justice in India' scheme, which strengthens pre-litigation advice through Tele-Law, facilitates pro bono legal services via the Nyaya Bandhu programme, and  promotes  legal literacy through  pan-India  awareness  campaigns,  utilising technology, and region-specific IEC materials to improve accessibility for the poor and marginalised.

11.103  The National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) is a social security programme for the vulnerable section of our society. The objective of the programme is to provide a basic level of financial assistance to old age, widows, and disabled persons as well as to bereaved households in the event of the death of the breadwinner belonging to the Below Poverty Line. NSAP caters to 3.09 crore BPL beneficiaries. Further, States/UTs are also providing financial assistance to additional 5.86 crore beneficiaries through State Pension Schemes. Therefore, around nine crore beneficiaries (central NSAP plus additional state beneficiaries) are covered under the pension safety net of the country at an estimated annual expenditure of more than ₹1 lakh crore. 196

## Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme

11.107  The MGNREGA 2005 aims at enhancing the livelihood security of households in  rural  areas  of  the  country  by  providing  at  least  100  days  of  guaranteed  wage employment in a financial year to every household whose adult members volunteer to do unskilled manual work. The physical progress of MGNREGS (the Scheme through which MGNREGA is implemented) is indicated below:

Table XI.8: Key indicators on MGNREGS

| Indicator                         |   2020-21 |   2021-22 |   2022-23 |   2023-24* |   2024-25* |
|-----------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|------------|
| Person-days generated (in crore)  |     389.1 |     363.3 |     293.8 |      308.9 |     220.11 |
| Average person-days per household |      51.5 |      50.1 |      47.8 |       52.1 |      42.77 |
| Women participation rate (%age)   |      53.2 |      54.7 |      57.5 |       58.9 |      57.97 |

*As per MIS (as of 10 January 2025)

11.108  Multiple efficiency reforms have been introduced to fully utilise the scheme. To ensure probity and elimination of leakages, geotagging before, during, and after the work is being done, 99.98 per cent payments are through National Electronic Fund Management System, wages are transferred under DBT, Aadhaar-based payment has been enabled for 96.3 per cent of total active workers, 99.23 per cent of total successful transactions for wage beneficiaries has been processed through APBS (Aadhaar Payment Bridge System)  in Dec 2024and social audit units have been set up in 28 states/UTs.

11.109  While MGNREGS began as a wage employment scheme, it has evolved into a durable rural asset creation programme for sustainable livelihood diversification, as seen in the rise in the share of individual beneficiary 'works on individual land' from 16.2 per cent of total completed works in FY15 to 71.2 per cent in FY25 (the share in terms of expenditure is much lower, yet rose from 11.65 per cent in FY15 to 28.9 per cent in FY25). MGNREGS has also helped in boosting rural ecological health through improvement of soil quality and plantation and has improved rural water management for agriculture through  integrated  watershed  management  (IWM)  assets.  Capacity  development  of workers is being promoted through initiatives like Bare Foot Technicians (BFT) 198 and UNNATI 199 skilling project.

11.110  Further,  the  scheme  is  converged  with  various  initiatives,  including  NutriGardens with NRLM, fodder farms with the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying (DAHD), horticulture with the Ministry of Agriculture, medicinal plantations with the Ministry of Ayush, Gram Panchayat buildings with the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, community sanitary complexes with SBM Grameen, construction of Anganwadi Centres  with  Ministry  of  Women  and  Child  Development,  promoting  sericulture plantations  with  Ministry  of  Textiles,  supporting  rubber  plantations  with  Rubber Board (Ministry of Commerce),  promoting aquaculture in ponds and farm ponds with Department of Fisheries, rural roads with PM Gram Sadak Yojana, and all-weather roads with BRO for border areas. Apart from that, convergence is also made at the state  level  with  different  state  departments  such  as  Forest  Department,  agriculture Department, Horticulture  Department,  Tribal  Development  Department  and  others for implementation of developmental works in rural areas.
