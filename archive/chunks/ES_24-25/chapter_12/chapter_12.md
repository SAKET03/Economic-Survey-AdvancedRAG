## EMPLOYMENT AND SKILL DEVELOPMENT: EXISTENTIAL PRIORITIES

CHAPTER

<!-- image -->

12

India's  labour  market indicators have experienced substantial improvements in  recent  years  driven  by  a  robust  post-pandemic  recovery  and  increased formalisation. According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey, the unemployment rate  has  significantly  declined  over  time,  alongside  positive  trends  in  labour force participation and the worker population ratio. Factory employment data further reflects the manufacturing sector's resilience.

To fully capitalise on the demographic dividend, it is well-recognised that creating quality jobs that offer sustainable livelihoods is crucial. Further, by prioritising reskilling, upskilling, and new-skilling, the government is aiming to align the workforce  with  global  demands,  enhancing  both  domestic  and  international employability.  Simplifying  compliances,  promoting  labour  flexibility,  and strengthening  workers'  welfare  are  vital  for  driving  sustainable  job  growth. Lowering  the  fixed  costs  of  doing  business  through  deregulation  will  create room for enterprises to hire more. To boost women's workforce participation, prioritising targeted skill development and providing entrepreneurial support is being pursued. Additionally, sectors like the digital economy and renewable energy offer vast potential for creating high-quality jobs, which is essential for achieving the Viksit Bharat's vision.

## INTRODUCTION

12.1. As  the  crucial  link  between  growth  and  prosperity,  the  quantity  and  quality  of employment in an economy determines how economic growth sustainably percolates the masses. With around 26 per cent of the population in the age group 10-24 years, India stands at the cusp of a once-in-a-lifetime demographic opportunity. 1  As one of the youngest nations globally, India's economic success depends on integrating its growing workforce  into  productive  and  meaningful  roles,  ensuring  inclusive  and  long-term growth.

12.2.  In 2014, India was ranked as the tenth-largest economy in the world. In under a decade, India surpassed the UK to reach the fourth position. She is poised to be the

1   State of the World Population Report 2024, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) (https://www.unfpa.org/ swp2024)

third  largest  economy  by  2030,  after  the  USA  and  China.  By  2030,  she  will  have  a growing  working-age  population  and  healthy  manufacturing  sector.  The  country's demographic trend highlights the growing potential for a demographic dividend. 2  The currently young population, with a median age of around 28 years, compared to the ageing population of developed countries, is the key driver of the growth potential. 3

12.3.  The  declining  dependency  ratio 4 ,  marked  by  the  falling  child  dependency  ratio following declining fertility rates, has contributed to this demographic advantage. This is  further supported by a relatively gradual increase in the elderly dependency ratio due to increased life expectancy. 5  The total dependency ratio has declined from 64.6 per cent in 2011 to 55.7 per cent in 2021 and is projected to fall further to 54.3 per cent by 2026. 6   The  expanding  working-age  population  offers  opportunities  for  economic growth, provided these individuals are employed in productive sectors.

12.4.    The Economic Survey 2023-24 highlighted that the Indian economy must generate, on average, 78.5 lakh non-farm jobs annually until 2030 to productively engage its growing  working  population.  Creating  quality  jobs  remains  an  ongoing  endeavour and a well-recognised national priority, pivotal to ensuring inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Further, the ambitions and aspirations of the workforce align with the need to generate employment opportunities to leverage the country's demographic dividend and to accelerate the structural transformation from farm to non-farm jobs.

12.5. Against this backdrop, this chapter analyses the employment  and  skill development trends and challenges in the economy. The first section delves into the state of employment, focusing on the sectoral and gender distribution of the workforce and  state-wise  trends.  The  second  section  focuses  on  job  creation  and  outlines  the government's actions to enhance employment opportunities. It highlights initiatives such  as  labour  law  reforms,  potential  sectors  for  job  creation,  and  the  role  of  skill development.  The challenge of re-strategising the skills development framework to prepare the youth for evolving industry requirements domestically and internationally is discussed in the third section.

## STATE OF EMPLOYMENT

12.6.    India  has  experienced  good employment growth in recent years, following the nation's sustained economic momentum. The 2023-24 annual Periodic Labour Force Survey  (PLFS)  report  by  the  National  Statistical  Organisation  (NSO)  highlights  a significant post-pandemic recovery in employment trends across India. 8  The all-India annual unemployment rate (UR) for individuals aged 15 years and above (usual status) 9 has  steadily  declined  from  6  per  cent  in  2017-18  to  3.2  per  cent  in  2023-24. 10 This recovery has been accompanied by an increase in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) and the worker-to-population ratio (WPR). 11  Moreover, even under the stricter current weekly status (CWS) criteria, employment levels have rebounded strongly in both  urban  and  rural  areas,  reflecting  a  broad-based  recovery  since  the  COVID-19 pandemic. 12

12.7.  In addition, the quarterly urban unemployment rate (UR) for people aged 15 years and above has shown improvement. The urban UR has dropped from 6.6 per cent in Q2 FY 24 to 6.4 per cent in Q2 FY 25. This positive shift aligns with a broader strengthening of workforce metrics in urban areas, as the LFPR increased from 49.3 per cent to 50.4 per cent, and the WPR rose from 46 per cent to 47.2 per cent during the same period (Q2 of FY24 to Q2 FY25). 13

8  https://tinyurl.com/yaykmtat ; The period of the PLFS surveys is July-June. For example the survey period for 2023-24 is July 2023 to June 2024.

9    For a person to be categorised as employed as per usual status (ps+ss), he/she must have pursued an economic activity for at least 30 days during the 365 days preceding the date of the survey.

10    UR is defined as the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force.

11    According to the PLFS, LFPR is the percentage of working-age population engaged in work or making tangible. efforts to seek 'work' or being available for 'work' if it is available. 'Work' includes self-employment (subsistence agriculture  and  collection  of  firewood,  poultry  farming,  etc.,  for  self-consumption),  regular  wage/salaried employment, and casual labour. WPR is defined as the percentage of employed persons in the total population.

12    In the case of CWS, the activity status is determined on the basis of a reference period of the last 7 days preceding the date of the survey.

12.8.   The  2023-24  annual  PLFS  report  highlights  encouraging  trends  in  labour market conditions across India. Among the 36 states and union territories, only 12 have a WPR (for all ages) below the national average of 43.7 per cent, and 12 fall short of the national LFPR (for all ages) average of 45.1 per cent (refer to Chart XII.6). Further, 14 states have achieved over a 10-percentage point increase in WPR 14 , and 11 states have recorded a similar increase in LFPR compared to 2017-18. 15,16

<!-- image -->

12.9.     The proportion of self-employed workers in the workforce has risen from 52.2 per cent in 2017-18 to 58.4 per cent in 2023-24. This shift reflects growing entrepreneurial activity and a preference for flexible work arrangements. While the share of workers (male and female) in regular/salaried jobs decreased from 22.8 per cent to 21.7 per cent during the same period, the trend has stabilised since 2020-21, with employment levels either holding steady or showing gradual improvement. The decline in casual workers, from 24.9 per cent to 19.8 per cent, also indicates a shift toward more structured forms of  self-employment.  These  changes  suggest  an  evolving  workforce  that  embraces flexibility  and independence in response to industry transformations and individual preferences.

12.10.  According to PLFS data, the shift in employment trends has been particularly impactful  for  women.  While  the  proportion  of  women  in  regular  wage/salaried employment  decreased,  more  women  engage  in  self-employment  or  contribute  to household enterprises, especially in rural areas. For instance, in rural India, women's participation in regular wage jobs fell from 10.5 per cent in 2017-18 to 7.8 per cent in 2023-24, coinciding with an increase in women working as "own account workers/ employers" or "helpers in household enterprises." In urban areas, salaried employment for women decreased from 52.1 per cent to 49.4 per cent. The bulk of the drop occurred in 2020-21, when it dropped to 50.1 per cent from 54.2 per cent the year before. This was accompanied by a rise in entrepreneurial ventures and flexible work roles.

12.11.  Among  rural  women,  the  share  of  "own  account  workers/employers"  surged from 19 per cent in 2017-18 to 31.2 per cent in 2023-24, highlighting a significant move toward independent work and entrepreneurship. Similarly, the share of "helpers in household enterprises", which represents unpaid family labour, grew from 38.7 per cent to 42.3 per cent, indicating a rise in family-oriented economic activities.   The rise in casual wages could be one of the factors contributing to this increasing reliance on family labour within household enterprises. Urban areas also witnessed a positive shift, with "own account workers/employers" increasing from 23.7 per cent to 28.5 per cent and "helpers in household enterprises" from 11 per cent to 13.8 per cent over the same period.

12.12   PLFS covers the period from July to June; hence, the full force of the lockdowns in  different  states  is  felt  in  2019-20.  The  impact  of  the  pandemic  felt  in  lost  years of  schooling, and the health of the elderly resulted in women leaving regular wage/ salary work and taking up flexible work so that they could take care of children who stayed at home due to school closures and elders who needed extra care and attention. Subsequently, the enhanced flexibility that 'own account work' allows and the expanded

opportunities it has brought for women have seen this category grow in the share of overall employment.

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;

12.13.  Initiatives  such  as  Mudra  Yojana,  Skill  India,  Start-Up  India,  and  Stand-Up India have played a pivotal role in fostering entrepreneurship, providing skill training, and  supporting  individuals  in  creating  self-reliant  and  sustainable  livelihoods.  This ecosystem  of  support  reflects  the  growing  emphasis  on  empowering  individuals  to chart their own professional paths.

## Sectoral distribution of the workforce

12.14.  According  to  the  PLFS  2023-24,  the  agriculture  sector  remains  dominant  in employment, with its share rising from 44.1 per cent in 2017-18 to 46.1 per cent in 2023-24. The share of industry and services sectors saw declines in employment share, with manufacturing falling from 12.1 per cent to 11.4 per cent, and services from 31.1 per cent to 29.7 per cent during the same period. The share of female workers in agriculture has increased significantly, from 57.0 per cent in 2017-18 to 64.4 per cent in 2023-24, whereas, male participation in agriculture decreased from 40.2 per cent to 36.3 per cent. Greater male involvement in sectors like construction, trade, hotel, restaurant, transport, storage and communication services is observed.

Note: The 'other services' category includes activities belonging to publishing, consultancy services, information services, financial and insurance services, real estate, legal and accounting, advertising, health and education services, tours and travels, arts, entertainment and recreation, etc.

12.15.  In rural areas, female agricultural employment rose from 73.2 per cent in 201718 to 76.9 in 2023-24 per cent, while male participation decreased from 55.0 per cent to 49.4 per cent, reflecting a shift towards non-agricultural sectors during the same period. In urban areas, women predominantly work in other services, though this share declined slightly from 44.4 per cent in 2017-18 to 40.1 per cent in 2023-24.  Significant employment  of  females  is  also  observed  in  manufacturing,  trade,  and  agriculture. Male  workers  in  urban  areas  are  seen  to  be  primarily  employed  in  manufacturing, construction, and trade-related services.

## Rise in Female LFPR: Tapping into female labour for economic growth

12.16.  From the gender perspective, the female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) has been rising for seven years, i.e., from 23.3 per cent in 2017-18 to 41.7 per cent in 2023-24, driven mainly by the rising participation of rural women. The notable rise in the FLFPR is the primary driver of the overall improvement in the labour market indicators.

12.17.  The FLFPR has improved across states. In 2017-18, 20 states/UTs had FLFPR of less than 20 per cent. This number has gone down to three in 2023-24 Currently, most states (21) have a FLFPR in the range of 30-40 per cent.  Seven states/ UTs reported FLFPR greater than 40 per cent in 2023-24, with Sikkim reporting the maximum rate of 56.9 per cent.

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;

12.18.  The increase in the rural FLFPR largely drives the increase in FLFPR, which rose from 24.6 per cent in 2017-18 to 47.6 per cent in 2023-24. This rise could be attributed to  women  taking  advantage  of  new  opportunities  brought  about  by  the  various government initiatives to promote female participation in the labour force. Box XII.1 discusses the possible reasons for higher FLFPR in India. It also elaborates on findings from a primary survey conducted in selected districts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh in November 2024 regarding the increase in FLFPR.

## Box XII.1: Factors influencing the female labour force participation

PLFS 2023-24 shows enhanced participation of women in economic activities across various categories, including rural and urban. This increase in FLFPR can partly be attributed to better capturing female workers in unpaid work by the PLFS survey. 17   Further, the increase

17  PIB release of Ministry of Labour &amp; Employment dated 18 November 2024. (https://tinyurl.com/3usymatj).

in  the  rural  FLFPR  can  be  attributed  to  the  skilling  initiatives  and  improved  access  to credit  for  diversified  livelihoods  provided  to  women's  collectives  under  the  Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM). The increased push of government towards encouraging entrepreneurship is also likely a key contributor to the increased participation of women in the labour force. Some of these initiatives are discussed in Box XII.2.

To better understand the labour market choices of female workers, both paid and unpaid, a  survey  was  conducted  among  married  women  aged  25  to  45  in  rural  areas  who  were relatively less financially privileged. The survey focused on those receiving loans from SHGs and represented a population poorer than the average Indian population.  18  It was observed that 34 per cent of surveyed women were engaged in paid work, most pronounced among poorer households. In the households below average levels of wealth in the sample, 46 per cent of women are engaged in paid work, whereas less than 15 per cent of women are engaged in paid work if they come from the top 10 per cent of wealthiest households in the sample.

Among women not engaged in paid work, 58 per cent were engaged in unpaid work (helping the household in agricultural tasks). This suggests that more than 70 per cent of the married women were engaged in  (paid  or  unpaid)  labour,  directly  generating  greater  household income. Further, about 55 per cent of those currently out of the workforce cited household and childcare duties as barriers to entering the paid workforce.

According to some research,  gender  norms  and  the  associated  responsibilities/responsibilities of childcare and household responsibilities are prominent reasons for women not taking up paid work despite the desire to do so. 19 This finding highlights the care sector's vast potential for increasing FLFPR, as noted in the Economic Survey 2023-24.

The Economic Survey 2023-24 (Box VIII.2) highlighted the systemic barriers that impede job  opportunities  for  women.  To  sustain  and  enhance  women's  participation  in  the workforce, it is essential to remove restrictions on women working in certain occupations. This responsibility lies with state governments. As women cite childcare responsibilities as a consideration in deciding on employment, childcare facilities and crèches will go a long way in female participation in the labour force. Additionally, policies should prioritise targeted skill development and support for emerging sectors while encouraging transitioning from traditional to non-traditional roles. Aligning skill development programmes with industry needs and adopting a long-term strategy focused on women and girls will prepare them for evolving job opportunities and help India effectively leverage its demographic dividend. Reshaping the labour market with an emphasis on women-led development is crucial for achieving gender parity and fostering inclusive economic growth.

18    This was part of the same survey done by Artha Global's Centre for Rapid Insights (CRI) as reported in Box XI.2 in chapter 11. Artha Global's Centre for Rapid Insights (CRI) conducted a survey of approximately 2400 married women between the ages of 25 and 45 in rural areas, who were relatively less financially privileged, in selected districts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh in November 2024.  The sample population is  poorer  than  the  Indian  population  on  average.  This  demographic  group  was  chosen  for  study  because  an increased female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) has been observed among this group. Furthermore, as a popular target for DBTs and cash, as well as loans through SHGs from both the Centre and various state governments, a survey of this group, allows for an analysis of patterns of consumption due to cash transfers and loans.

12.19.  Women  have  been  key  beneficiaries  of  various  initiatives  designed  to  foster entrepreneurship. As of 31 October 2024, a total number of 73,151 startups with at least  one  woman  director  have  been  recognised  under  the  Startup  India  Initiative. This  represents  nearly  half  of  the  1,52,139  start-ups  supported  by  the  government. ₹3,107.11  crore  has  been  invested  in  149  women-led  startups  through  Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). 20  Since its inception in April 2021, the Start-up India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) has approved ₹227.12 crore in funding for  1,278  women-led startups. 21  Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS) 22 has guaranteed ₹24.6 crore in  loans  for  women-led  ventures. 23   These  programmes  offer  women  entrepreneurs financial support, training, and mentorship, empowering them to start and scale their businesses.

## Harnessing the power of women entrepreneurs for India's economic future

12.20. A  recent  World  Bank  paper  (Gupta  et  al.,  2024)  highlights  that  promoting women-owned,  growth-oriented  enterprises  could  significantly  boost  FLFPR  and economic growth in rural India. The paper emphasises the importance of providing business development services to support and enhance women's entrepreneurial efforts. 24

12.21.   Of the nearly 4.96 lakh people engaged in the khadi sector, over 80 per cent are women artisans. 25  It is estimated that more than 50 per cent of persons practising sericulture are women. Out of the total workforce engaged in the handicrafts sector, an estimated 56.1 per cent are women. 26  Certain crafts, like embroidery, mat weaving, etc., are practised predominantly by women. As per the Handloom Census 2019-20, handloom activity in India is also dominated by female workers (72 per cent). 27

12.22. However, the reins of ownership in entrepreneurship still remain dominantly male-held.  Only 22 per cent of all micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) are owned by women entrepreneurs. Diving further, as the size of the enterprise increases from micro to small and then to medium, women's share in ownership drops from 22 per cent to 12 per cent and further to 7 per cent, respectively. 28  However, this is not

unique to India but is a ubiquitous trend. As per a report on gender diversity, women hold less than one-quarter of the world's board seats (23.3 per cent in 2023). Across India Inc., women only held 18.3 per cent of board seats in 2023. 29 Box XII.2 discusses some of the initiatives taken by the government to promote female entrepreneurship.

Other flagship schemes: Besides these, certain flagship schemes of the government of India, such as Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, DAY-NRLM etc., are also oriented towards promoting women-led enterprises. Other schemes and initiatives, such as Yashasvini mass awareness campaigns, are also available for women entrepreneurship development.

12.23. Building a strong ecosystem for women's entrepreneurship requires innovative solutions  alongside  government  initiatives  focusing  on  credit  access,  skill  training, and formalisation. Rural women entrepreneurs face additional challenges, including limited business skills, market access, and technology gaps, compounded by a lack of mentorship and networking. Streamlining support through credit linkages, sensitising bankers, and efficient delivery mechanisms is essential. Cost-effective strategies, such as  raising  awareness,  providing  skill  training,  and  improving  access  to  government benefits, can empower women entrepreneurs. Institutions like the Global Alliance for Mass  Entrepreneurship  (GAME)  address  systemic  barriers,  supporting  women-led MSMEs with access to markets, credit, and growth opportunities. 43

12.24. NRLM partnered with GAME to empower rural women entrepreneurs through the  Women  Entrepreneur  Financial  Empowerment  Programme  (WEFEP). 44   The programme  improves  credit  access  for  rural  women  entrepreneurs  by  identifying and  supporting  aspiring  individual  rural  women  entrepreneurs  through  enterprise formalisation, business planning, and loan application processes. This is done with the support of NRLM's ground cadres like " Vitta Sakhis ." Vitta Sakhis guide women on loan options and assist with bank visits, documentation, and business proposals, reducing bank linkage time. Under the initiative, 862 Vitta Sakhis were trained, outreach and assessment of 20190 women entrepreneurs were done, 10713 loan applications were submitted,  2400  loans  were  sanctioned,  and  banks  disbursed  ₹30  lakh  in  loans  to rural women entrepreneurs. 45  Meanwhile, the "Growtherator" programme accelerates MSME growth,  fostering  profitability,  job  creation,  and  long-term  success  through mentorship and peer networks. 46

12.25.  Systemic challenges such as skill gaps, compliance barriers, and limited mobility restrict women's access to digital platforms. GAME's Women Economic Empowerment (WEE)  programme  fosters  gender-responsive  policies  to  bridge  this  gap.  It  builds replicable  models  with  private  partners  for  rural  e-commerce,  social  commerce,  gig work, and job tech, enabling women entrepreneurs to participate actively in the platform

It is India's first state-led incubator for women entrepreneurs. 48  WE Hub was started with the mission to ensure that all women entrepreneurs in the country have access to technical, financial, governmental, and policy support required to start up, scale up, sustain, and accelerate with global market access. It has raised ₹177 crore in funding. 6376 start-ups and SMEs have been incubated. It has engaged around 7828 entrepreneurs and has launched 87 start-up programmes, and 75 per cent of the startups survive beyond 2 years. 49

12.27.  As women continue to overcome challenges and dismantle barriers, their progress drives  empowerment, creates job opportunities and builds the foundation for more inclusive economic growth. The growing participation of women in entrepreneurship can propel the country towards higher levels of development by tapping into their latent potential to contribute to economic activities.

## Trends in wages and earnings

12.28. The 2023-24 PLFS results provide earnings data segmented by status (regular/ salaried, casual, and self-employed workers), gender and location (urban and rural). The average monthly earnings of workers vary across different segments. While the average monthly earnings for regular wage/salaried workers and self-employed workers grew at a CAGR of 5 per cent during the period 2018-19 to 2023-24, the daily wage of casual workers increased at a CAGR of 9 per cent during the same period.  Earnings for selfemployed workers showcased a dynamic trajectory, with a brief dip from 2017-18 to 2020-21, followed by a significant rebound post-pandemic. Nominal wages have shown good growth across all categories, outpacing growth in real wages.

## Trends in rural wages

12.29. As per data of Labour Bureau 56 , in FY25 (April- September 2024), rural wages rose  at  above-4  per  cent  every  month,  YoY.  On  average,  the  nominal  wage  rate  in agriculture grew by 5.7 per cent for men and 7 per cent for women. In non-agricultural activities, nominal wage growth was slightly lower for men, at 5.5 per cent, but higher for women, at 7.9 per cent during the same period.

12.30. When  adjusted  for  inflation,  the  real  wage  rate  in  agriculture  demonstrated modest growth, increasing by 0.6 per cent for men and 1.8 per cent for women. In

## Wages in unincorporated sector enterprises

12.31.   As per the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) results for 2023-24 57 , the average emolument per hired worker rose by 13 per cent in 202324 compared to 2022-23, with the average emolument per hired worker rising from ₹1,24,842 in 2022-23 to ₹1,41,071 in 2023-24, signalling improved wage levels 58 This growth, led by a 16.1 per cent increase in the manufacturing sector average emolument per hired worker, is strengthening the labour market, boosting productivity, and driving economic demand.

12.32. The ASUSE 2023-24 results highlight the notable labour market improvements of  the  non-agricultural  unincorporated  sectors,  with  hired  workers  increasing  from 2.95 crore in 2022-23 to 3.15 crore in 2023-24, reflecting healthy employment growth.

57  The period for the survey is October 2023 to September 2024.

58    ASUSE conducted by NSSO, is a survey of unincorporated non-agricultural establishments belonging to three sectors viz., Manufacturing, Trade and Other Services. Ownership-wise, this Survey covers unincorporated nonagricultural establishments pertaining to proprietorship, partnership (excluding limited liability partnerships), self-help groups, cooperatives, societies/trusts etc (https://tinyurl.com/b9k4apur).

12.33. Beyond  wage  trends,  examining  corporate  profits  and  wage  share  is  crucial to  understanding  how  income  distribution  between  labour  and  capital  influences productivity, competitiveness, and sustainable growth. The same has been discussed in Box XII.3 .

## Box XII.3: Corporate Profitability Hits 15-Year High even as wage growth moderates

Corporate  profitability  soared  to  a  15-year  peak  in  FY24,  fuelled  by  robust  growth  in financials, energy, and automobiles. Among Nifty 500 companies, the profit-to-GDP ratio surged from 2.1 per cent in FY03 to 4.8 per cent in FY24, the highest since FY08. 59  Large corporations, especially in non-financial sectors, significantly outperformed their smaller peers in profitability.

However, while profits surged, wages lagged. A striking disparity has emerged in corporate India: profits climbed 22.3 per cent in FY24, but employment grew by a mere 1.5 per cent. 60 State Bank of India (SBI) analysis reveals that 4,000 listed companies recorded a modest 6  per  cent  revenue  growth.  At  the  same  time,  employee  expenses  rose  only  13  per  cent -down from 17 per cent in FY23 - highlighting a sharp focus on cost-cutting over workforce expansion. 61

Despite Indian companies achieving a stable EBITDA margin of 22 per cent over the last four years, wage growth has moderated. This uneven growth trajectory raises critical concerns. Wage stagnation is pronounced, particularly at entry-level IT positions.

While the labour share of GVA shows a slight uptick, the disproportionate rise in corporate profits-predominantly  among  large  firms-raises  concerns  about  income  inequality.  A higher profit share and stagnant wage growth risk slowing the economy by curbing demand. Sustained economic growth hinges on bolstering employment incomes, which directly fuel consumer spending, spurring investment in production capacity.

To secure long-term stability, a fair and reasonable distribution of income between capital and labour is imperative. It is essential for sustaining demand and supporting corporate revenue and profitability growth in the medium to long run.

Japan succeeded in industrialisation  and  in  becoming  a  developed  economy,  despite  its defeat  in  WW  II  through  a  social  contract  between  the  government,  the  businesses  and workers, write Matthew C. Klein and Michael Pettis in 'Trade Wars are Class Wars':

' Japanese  workers,  consumers,  and  retirees  all  subsidised  industrial  development  by overpaying  for  goods  and  services,  by  taking  home  a  lower  share  of  national  output than their counterparts in the West, and by using a financial system designed to transfer purchasing  power  from  households  to  businesses.  Japanese  companies  returned  the favour by upgrading the country's manufacturing base, passing along productivity gains to workers, and refraining from excessive executive pay, while the government invested in top-tier infrastructure. '

## Employment in factories

12.34. The  Annual  Survey  of  Industries  (ASI)  results  for  the  FY23 62 highlight  the manufacturing  sector's  resilience,  showing  a  more  than  7  per  cent  increase  in employment over the previous year. 63  This translates into an addition of over 22 lakh jobs in FY 23 over FY 19 (pre-pandemic level), underscoring the sector's robust postpandemic recovery. 64  During the pandemic in FY 21, the sector lost approximately 5 lakh jobs. The growth of the sector in FY 23 indicates a strong rebound of the sector as economic conditions improved.

62  Reference period of the survey is April 2022 to March 2023.

63    The ASI, conducted by the MoSPI, covers the organised manufacturing sector. Its coverage extends to the entire Factory Sector comprising industrial units (called factories) registered under the Sections 2(m)(i) and 2(m)(ii) of the Factories Act, 1948, with ten or more workers with electricity or twenty or more workers without electricity. (https://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/asi\_results/ASI  per  cent20Summary  per  cent20Results  per cent202022-23.pdf)

64    It may be noted that employment refers to total persons engaged (TPE), which includes the employees (which include workers and clerical/administrative staff) and all working proprietors and their family members who are actively engaged in the work of the factory even without any pay, and the unpaid members of the cooperative societies who worked in or for the factory in any direct and productive capacity.

Source: ASI report, MoSPI

Note: TPE: Total Persons Engaged

12.35.  The results of ASI FY23 indicate a continued increase in the number of large factories i.e., those employing more than 100 workers.  The number of such factories saw a robust growth of 7 per cent compared to FY22, while small factories (employing fewer than 100 workers) also experienced a steady increase of 2 per cent. Notably, large factories now account for around 22 per cent of all operational factories, reflecting their growing presence and contribution to the industrial landscape.

12.36. In terms of the share of employment, large factories continue to employ about 80 per cent of the total workers 65 and 78 per cent of the TPE 66  in the sector, whereas small factories, although larger in number, comprise a smaller share of employment in the sector.

12.37.  Seven industry groups in the sector contribute to around 54 per cent of the total employment. These are food products, textiles, basic metals, wearing apparel, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, machinery and equipment N.E.C., and chemicals and chemical products. Other than these leading industries, industry groups representing computer, electronic and optical products and the manufacture of furniture have seen strong growth in employment compared to the pre-pandemic level with around 50 per cent growth in TPE. This indicates a positive shift towards electronics manufacturing in India.

65    Workers  are  directly  involved  in  the  manufacturing  process  or  in  activities  incidental  to  the  manufacturing process, such as cleaning and repair. They can be employed directly or through an agency.

## Growing formal sector in India

12.38. Formalisation of the job market, as reflected in payroll data from the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), indicates that government initiatives are helping foster  greater  economic  formalisation. 67 Net  additions  to  EPFO  subscriptions  have more than doubled, rising from 61 lakh in FY19 to 131 lakh in FY24. During the first eight  months of  FY25  (April  to  November  2024),  cumulative  net  additions  reached 95.6 lakh, marking a 3 per cent YoY increase compared to the 92.9 lakh recorded during the same period in FY24. EPFO membership stands at 32.7 crore as of March 2024, compared to 29.9 crore as of March 2023.

67    The EPFO data covers the low-paid workers in medium and large formal sector establishments. EPFO publishes subscription data every month, with a lag of two months.

Note: Net addition in payroll = No. of new subscribers + No. of exited members who re-joined - No. of members exited

12.39. In  terms  of  industrial  composition,  expert  services  form  the  largest  share  of EPFO payroll addition (50 per cent in FY25, April-November), followed by tradingother  industries  (12  per  cent)  and  trading-commercial  establishments  (7  per  cent). Over the years, expert services have consistently led in formal job creation, as reflected in net payroll additions.

12.40. Across age groups, the age group of 18-25 years contributed to 47 per cent of the net payroll addition in April-November 2024. With nearly 61 per cent of net payroll addition coming from less than 29 years of age (in the same period), new jobs in the organised sector are mainly going to the youth.

12.41.  The eShram portal 68 , was launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) on 26 August 2021 to recognise unorganised workers. The portal helps register and support unorganised workers by providing them with a Universal Account Number (UAN) and for  the  creation  of  a  comprehensive  National  Database  of  Unorganised Workers (NDUW). 69  As of 31 December 2024, over 30.51 crore unorganised workers have already registered on the eShram portal.

12.42. Further, in keeping with the vision of developing eShram as a One-Stop-Solution for unorganised labour to have access to various social sector schemes, MoLE launched the eShram- 'One-Stop-Solution' on 21 October 2024, which entails the integration of different social security/ welfare schemes on a single portal, i.e., eShram. This enables unorganised workers registered on eShram to access social security schemes and see benefits availed by them so far through eShram. So far, 12 schemes of different central

## JOB CREATION: ACTION TOWARDS ENHANCED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES

## Security vs. Flexibility: The role of regulation in job creation

12.43. One key aspect of creating an enabling environment for businesses to grow is improving the ease of doing business and increasing flexibility in the labour market. In this regard, the government has worked to simplify labour laws. These reforms aim to  foster  job  creation,  enhance  transparency, and improve accountability within the system. Box XII.4 informs about the progress on this front.

## Box XII.4: Labour laws strengthening workers' rights

The central government has formulated four Labour Codes, namely, the Code on Wages, 2019;  the  Code  on  Social  Security,  2020;  the  Industrial  Relations  Code,  2020;  and  the Occupational  Safety,  Health,  and  Working  Conditions  Code,  2020  after  simplifying, rationalising, and amalgamating the 29 existing central laws. The Code on Wages, 2019, was notified on 8 August 2019, and the remaining three Codes were notified on 29 September 2020.

The  new  Labour  Codes  constitute  a  significant  step  for  workers'  rights  in  India  by strengthening the protection available to workers, including unorganised workers, regarding statutory  minimum  wage  and  its  timely  payment,  social  security,  occupational  safety, healthcare of workers, etc. The central government and 29 states/UTs have pre-published their draft rules under the four Labour Codes. Some of the remaining seven states/UTs have pre-published their draft rules for one or more Labour Codes.

Many states have already carried out various reforms in the spirit of the Labour Codes, such as:

- (a) Increasing the threshold of the number of workers from 100 to 300 for prior approval of appropriate government before retrenchment/ layoff/ closure of establishments in factory/plantation/ mining sector has been done by 14 states viz., Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh (AP), Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya  Pradesh  (MP),  Uttar  Pradesh  (UP),  Meghalaya,  Punjab  and  Odisha  under existing Industrial Disputes Act.  Himachal Pradesh (HP) has increased it to 200.
- (b) Six states viz. Bihar, Haryana, Goa, Punjab, Odisha, and HP have notified Fixed Term Employment under the existing Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946.

- (c) 15  states/UTs  viz.  Maharashtra,  Goa,  Haryana,  Odisha,  J&amp;K,  HP,  Punjab,  UP, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, MP, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Assam have allowed women to work in night shifts subject to fulfilment of safety provisions.
- (d) 12  states/UTs  viz.  Gujarat,  Maharashtra,  Andhra  Pradesh,  UP,  Odisha,  Rajasthan, Haryana, Goa, MP, Uttarakhand, Bihar, and Punjab increased the threshold from 20 to 50 for applicability of the Contract Labour (Regulation &amp; Abolition) Act, 1970. J&amp;K and Ladakh increased the threshold from 20 to 40, and Himachal Pradesh increased the threshold to 30.
- (e) 14 states/UTs viz. Haryana, Gujarat, Punjab, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, J&amp;K, Ladakh, Bihar, HP, Assam, Odisha, Manipur, and Jharkhand have increased the threshold for applicability of the Factories Act from 10 to 20(with power).
- (f) 16 states/UTs viz. Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, HP, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, MP, Meghalaya, Punjab, Rajasthan and UP have already increased the threshold for applicability of the Factories Act from 20 to  40(without  power).  This  increase  in  the  threshold  is  significant  as  it  extends the protection of the Factories Act to a larger number of workers, thereby enhancing workplace safety and labour rights.
- (g) Seven states viz. Maharashtra, Haryana, HP, Odisha, Punjab, Karnataka and UP have increased the ceiling of overtime hours from 75 up to 144 hours in any quarter.

12.44. Labour  regulations  play  a  significant  role  in  safeguarding  worker  rights  and holding  firms  accountable  for  their  working  conditions.  The  regulatory  framework not  only  shapes  the  business  environment  and  the  competitive  dynamics  of  firms and factories but also ensures workers' well-being. Among these, Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) regulations stand out as foundational measures to ensure secure and dignified working conditions, providing a sense of security and confidence to the workforce.

12.45.  Business experts, governments, economists, and management academics have repeatedly advocated for the role of working conditions, especially worker safety and well-being, in improving worker productivity. The role of OSH in enhancing worker productivity is discussed in Box XII.5 .

## Box XII.5: Occupational safety and health, labour productivity, and the role of Labour Laws.

OSH regulations 70  not only protect workers but also enhance efficiency and productivity. These regulations can be viewed as an investment in the long-term health of businesses and the economy. Literature and studies show that improving working conditions and implementing

70    The  Occupational  Safety,  Health  and  Working  Conditions  Code,  2020  has  been  notified  to  consolidate  and amend the laws regulating the occupational safety, health and working conditions of the persons employed in an establishment. https://tinyurl.com/25j6hxw2

OSH improve the GDP. The role of OSH in improving worker productivity is significant. This positive correlation underscores the importance of focusing on the effective implementation of OSH laws, as it directly contributes to increased productivity and economic growth. 71

The labour laws for OSH have been in place since the Factories Act of 1948, and over time, new regulations have been brought in with the Employees' State Insurance Act of 1948 and the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of  Service)  Act  of  1996.  The  new  Occupational  Safety,  Health,  and  Working  Conditions (OSH&amp;WC)  Code,  2020  has  introduced  several  worker-friendly  provisions  to  enhance occupational safety, health, and labour productivity. 72

India's manufacturing (11.4 per cent of total workforce) and construction (12 per cent of total  workforce)  workforce  are  prone  to  workplace  accidents.  The  Directorate  General Factory Advice Service &amp; Labour Institute (DGFASLI) monitors injuries in factories and major industries. Its data notes a decline in reported industrial injuries since 2015. 73  The number of injuries has reduced from 5500 in 2015 to 2365 in 2020.

<!-- image -->

## Challenges

While the National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) 74  emphasise the role of businesses in ensuring OSH in supply chains, many leading corporations have yet to effectively implement these principles, as highlighted in Safe in India Foundations (SII's) 75

71    Ministry of Labour and Employment, National Policy on Safety, Health and Environment at Workplace (https:// tinyurl.com/yvmvn3u6 ).

SafetyNiti reports. The report highlights the prevalence of injuries due to inadequate safety sensors and audit and training lapses in the automobile sector, as an example. 76

This  underscores  the  need  for  the  industry  to  improve  focus  on  prevention,  training, and compliance through monitoring and audits. Enlightened self-interest and long-term thinking require employers to realise that a safe, secure, and satisfactory workplace is the key to long-term employee morale and productivity. Ethical conduct and fairness in business are the signs and bedrock of a mature and developed society. Treating workers humanely and, providing for their safety and looking after them when injured make as much business sense as it is the fair and ethical thing to do. Industry associations and collective bodies must champion this cause among their members. Addressing these challenges would be essential to fostering a robust and safe working environment across industries.

## Way ahead

Technology-Driven Solutions: App-based worker reporting, can significantly enhance monitoring efforts. A good example is the Philippines' Online Labour Inspection System, which serves as a centralised digital platform for submitting safety records and accessing necessary templates. 77  The Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) data can help identify  unsafe  hotspots,  enabling  targeted  actions.  Additionally,  incorporating  a  safety module in the ASI would improve the quality of safety data.

Utilising  wearable  technology  in  accident-prone  areas,  adopting  the  internet  of  things (IoT) for risk detection in MSMEs, and offering affordable virtual reality training modules can greatly enhance safety standards. Additionally, employing blockchain technology for tracking of claims will improve the transparency of ESIC claims and audits.

More substantial Incentives: Implementing tiered safety protocols for various industries and simplifying regulations for smaller businesses can encourage compliance. Incentives such as safety awards, tax breaks, and a machine safety subsidy programme can motivate industries to enhance their safety measures. An example of this is South Korea's Voluntary Safety Certification. 78  Furthermore, shared safety officers and subsidised training through public-private partnerships can further bolster industry support. For example, Thailand's Industrial Estate Authority provides shared safety services for industrial zones, including training, inspections, and safety audits. 79

By adopting these measures aligned with occupational safety, health, and well-being, India can drive its manufacturing goals sustainably, thereby improving worker dignity, increasing business profitability, and enhancing labour productivity.

12.46. India's  labour  regulations  impose  extensive  compliance  requirements  on businesses  (Rajagopalan  &amp;  Shah,  2024). 80   For  example,  the  Factories  Act  of  1948 mandates  the  placement  of  spittoons,  specifies  the  materials  for  toilet  paper,  and dictates the design of washrooms. Similarly, other laws, like the Minimum Wages Act (1948) and the Maternity Benefit Act (1961), impose detailed specifications, through Rules, on register paper colours, font sizes on wage slips, and the distance between work areas and crèche facilities. Rather than focusing on essential safety and hygiene standards, these micromanaging regulations create unnecessary administrative burdens that hinder business growth. Implications of some of the laws on workers and firms are summarised in Box XII.6 .

## Box XII.6: Flexible labour regulations: Striking a balance for employment growth

Fostering  an  enabling  environment  that  supports  business  growth  is  crucial  for  driving employment  and  economic  development.  However,  there  are  instances  where  labour regulations  designed  to  protect  workers'  rights  perhaps  inadvertently  hinder  the  growth of  firms,  especially  small  and  medium  enterprises,  by  restricting  their  ability  to  expand operations when needed compared to global peers. In doing so, it dampens employment generation as well. Some such examples are presented here:

## Inflexible working hours

Section 51 of the Factories Act (1948) states, ' No adult worker shall be required or allowed to work in a factory for more than forty-eight hours in any week.' This clause limits the number of hours a worker can work in a day and a week. However, unlike India, certain countries allow these caps to be averaged over multiple days and weeks.

India's working hour regulations prevent manufacturers from meeting demand surges and participating in global markets. Manufacturers stay competitive by minimising the time to bring a product to the market (Afonso et al., 2000; Vesey, 1991). 82

To  reduce  time-to-market,  manufacturers  must  be  capable  of  temporarily  scaling  up production. Labour laws in other countries allow manufacturers to average working hour limits across weeks and sometimes months. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) also  recommends  allowing  manufacturers  the  freedom  to  average  working  hour  limits across 3 weeks. 83  However, India's working hour limits may increase the cost, time, and risk of manufacturing.

## Restrictions on overtime for factory workers

Section 65(3)(iv) of the Factories Act (1948) states, ' No worker shall be allowed to work overtime for more than seven consecutive days, and the total number of overtime hours in any quarter shall not exceed seventy-five .' This law limits the number of overtime hours

workers can perform and the overtime wages they can earn. While states may set their own limits,  these  are  generally  lower  than  those  established  by  other  countries.  The  earning potential of workers across countries can be assessed based on the restrictions on overtime hours. 84

Notes:

- a.  Overtime earnings = hourly wage rate * overtime premium * number of overtime hours allowed.
- i. Hourly wage rate = average daily wage rate (₹ 657.61) / 8 (the length of a day's shift in India)
- ii.  Overtime premium = mandated minimum premium under the country's laws.
- iii.  Average daily wage rate = Yearly wages paid per Indian manufacturing worker (as given in Annual Survey of Industries 2022-23) 95   / Maximum number of working days in a year = 2,05,175/312 = 657.61. This wage has been applied to all countries for the calculation.
- iv.  Number of working days in a year = Number of months * Number of working days in a month = 12 * 26 = 312).

- b.    The earnings data assumes that the worker can access the whole number of overtime hours allowed under the law. In practice, a higher overtime rate reduces the likelihood of workers accessing their desired number of overtime hours. Workers can earn more overtime income if higher limits are coupled with a lower overtime rate.
- c. Viet Nam's annual limit is lower than the sum of four quarterly limits. The quarterly limit is used here for calculation.
- d.    This minimum overtime wage rate only applies from the second overtime hour of a workday. The first overtime hour in a workday may be compensated at 150 per cent or more of the regular wage.
- e. The law does not impose any specific limits on overtime. The overtime limit has been derived from other daily-hour restrictions and spread over.
- f. The law does not mandate a minimum overtime premium. To calculate overtime earnings, the ILOrecommended premium of 1.25 is used.
- g.    The law does not impose any specific limits on overtime hours. The law does not set other limits from which overtime limits may be derived. Therefore, an overtime limit of 325 (the highest across countries) has been assumed.

Working hour restrictions are introduced to protect workers' health and prevent overwork. However,  the  various  limits  on  working  hours-per  day,  week,  quarter,  and  year-often conflict,  reducing  workers'  earning  potential.  For  instance,  Section  56  of  the  Factories Act limits a worker to a maximum of ten and a half hours at a factory daily, equating to approximately 63 hours in a six-day week. Of these, only 48 hours are considered regular (Section 51), three hours are considered rest intervals, and the remaining 12 hours count as overtime. Over a 13-week quarter, this would allow for 156 overtime hours; yet another provision (Section 65) caps overtime at only 75 hours per quarter. As a result, these laws inadvertently hinder workers' earning potential, ultimately affecting their financial wellbeing, as depicted in the table above. Notably, under the new Labour Laws, seven states viz. Maharashtra, Haryana, HP, Odisha, Punjab, Karnataka and UP have increased the ceiling of overtime hours from 75 up to 144 hours in any quarter.

In  general,  these  compliance  requirements  are  extensive  and  elaborate,  demanding considerable  management  bandwidth,  which  is  a  scarce  resource  in  small  enterprises. However, the new Labour Laws represent a step in the right direction. With the introduction of flexible regulations and their effective implementation, these laws could lead to growth for firms, creating more employment opportunities. They also safeguard labour rights and allow workers to increase their earnings.

12.47.   The Code on Social Security, 2020, is one of the four Labour Codes enacted by the Parliament. The Code provides for the framing of suitable social security measures for gig workers and platform workers on matters relating to life and disability cover, accident insurance, health and maternity benefits, old age protection, etc. The Code also provides for setting up a Social Security Fund to finance the welfare scheme. 96

12.48. To create a universal social security system for all Indians, especially the poor and the underprivileged, the government launched two social security schemes viz., the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) and the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) on a pan-India basis in May 2015. The Schemes are being

offered by public sector insurers and other insurers who offer the product on similar terms, with necessary approvals and ties with banks and post offices. As of 27 November 2024,  47.76  crore  and  21.75  crore  persons  have  been  enrolled  cumulatively  under PMSBY and PMJJBY, respectively. Further, 1,48,023 and 8,64,094 claims have been paid under PMSBY and PMJJBY, respectively. 97  Through the eShram portal, workers in the unorganised sector can easily access social security schemes and receive benefits.

## Driving employment opportunities through the digital economy

12.49. OECD defines digital economy as ' all  economic  activity  reliant  on,  or  significantly enhanced by the use of digital inputs, including digital technologies, infrastructure, digital  services,  and  data.  It  refers  to  all  producers  and  consumers,  including  the government, utilising these digital inputs in economic activities '. 98 According to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), India's digital economy is projected to surpass USD one trillion by 2025. 99

12.50. The digital economy has significantly broadened job opportunities, encompassing roles from delivery personnel, cab drivers, and beauty professionals to software engineers and data analysts. Hyperlocal service platforms have revolutionised the job landscape in  the  transportation,  food  delivery,  and  home  services  industries.  These  platforms have created flexible employment options by leveraging technology while transforming traditional service sectors into digitally driven ecosystems.  According to NITI Aayog, the gig workforce is projected to reach 23.5 crore by 2029-30, comprising 6.7 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce and 4.1 per cent of total livelihoods, reshaping the labour  market.  India's  gig  economy  is  proliferating,  fuelled  by  platformisation  and remote work. 100

12.51.  Digital  technologies  have  a  dual  effect  on  employment.  As  Acemoglu  and Restrepo (2019) note, automation replaces human labour through a displacement effect but also boosts demand for new roles through a reinstatement effect in both automated and complementary sectors. 101  This technological reinstatement effect has the potential to drive labour demand and create numerous new job positions, positively impacting employment.

12.52.  The digital economy offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gender gap and positively  impact  the  gender  structure  of  employment.  Women  often  face  distinct challenges  in  the  labour  market  compared  to  men,  including  unequal  access  to education,  limited  job  opportunities,  cultural  bias,  mobility  and  time  restrictions, and concerns about workplace safety. Such barriers frequently exclude women from participating  in  traditional  labour  markets,  particularly  in  developing  economies. The development of the digital economy can positively impact the gender structure of employment. The key benefit of the digital economy is that it allows and encourages remote working, where gender may not matter as much as in the physical economy. It  opens  opportunities  for  women  in  developing  countries  with  increased  financial independence and empowerment. 102

12.53.  A study based on fintech data for 114 economies worldwide by Loko and Yang (2022)  states  that  fintech  adoption  significantly  improves  female  employment  and reduces  gender  inequality. 103 Also,  it  mitigates  the  financial  constraints  of  femaleheaded firms. Similar findings are reported by Sioson and Kim (2019), who note that fintech may play a role in bridging the gender gap in financial inclusion and promoting financial independence. 104  These findings highlight the role that fintech advancements and the digital economy play in creating an enabling environment for women, promoting economic participation and reducing systemic barriers to access to finance.

12.54.  The digital economy holds immense potential to increase employment, but the extent of this impact varies across different industries. To ensure the long-term benefits of  digitalisation  on  employment,  it  is  crucial  to  have  the  right  policies  to  address potential negative impacts on labour share due to automation and digital integration. The special essay on Artificial Intelligence (AI) (chapter 13) discusses the labour market implications of advances in the field of AI.

## Building a green workforce: Job creation in the renewable energy sector

12.55.  The Economic Survey 2023-24 discussed the impact of climate change and green transition on the job landscape. The efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change by adopting green technologies and transitioning to greener energy alternatives are expected to witness a strong job-creation effect.

12.56.  According to the 2024 Annual Review by the International Renewable Energy Agency  (IRENA),  the  total  number  of  jobs  in  the  renewable  energy  sector  in  India reached an estimated 1.02 million in 2023. 105  Hydropower is the largest employer in India's renewable sector, providing approximately 453,000 jobs and accounting for 20 per cent of the global total, ranking second only to China.

12.57.  In  addition  to  creating  livelihood  opportunities,  the  renewable  energy  sector provides an opportunity for job creation for women, enhancing their participation in the labour market. The Solar Urja Lamps project in Dungarpur, Rajasthan, is a notable example  of  how  the  renewable  sector  provides  a  unique  opportunity  for  women's empowerment. The project  was  initiated  to  provide  an  economical  and  sustainable solar  lighting  solution.  Women's  self-help  group  (SHG)  members  were  trained  and mentored to become solar entrepreneurs. The project resulted in the employment of 83 women, the establishment of five solar shops, and the assembly, sale, and maintenance of 40,000 solar lamps. 106 The tribal women engaged in the project could earn ₹ 5,0006,000 per month.

12.58. Another example is the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) interventions. GEAPP India works closely with the DAY-NRLM to design and develop programmes to provide reliable clean energy access leading to improved livelihood for women enterprises. GEAPP India, in collaboration with the rural livelihood mission of UP, has rolled out a programme targeting solarising 50,000 women enterprises in 2025. The objective is to bring one lakh women enterprises under this programme by 2027 and five lakh by 2030. 107

12.59.  Climate  change  and  frequent  disasters  disproportionately  impact  women, especially  those  in  rural  and  low-income  households,  threatening  their  livelihoods. As  climate  risks  grow,  there  is  an  increasing  thrust  for  SHGs  to  enable  alternative livelihoods, creating opportunities for women in agriculture, home-based work, and MSMEs. Achieving this  requires  an  ecosystem  with  access  to  tailored  technologies, reliable energy, financial support, and business development services.

12.60. Technological,  financial,  and  social  challenges  exist  for  women  engaging  in alternative livelihoods. Gender-biased tools, limited financing, and socio-cultural and geographic barriers constrain women's productivity and economic participation. Poorly designed, energy-inefficient tools force manual labour, while high costs and complex credit processes hinder technology adoption. Remote and hilly areas face additional challenges, including limited mobility, market access, and energy reliability.

12.61.  Climate-smart  solutions  that  use  Decentralised  Renewable  Energy  (DRE) (primarily solar energy) to power efficient appliances present a promising option to begin addressing these challenges in women-led livelihoods. There is substantial scope for  these  DRE-enabled  livelihood  solutions  in  agriculture,  agro-processing,  dairy, poultry, fisheries, textiles, crafts, and micro-enterprises.

12.62. The SELCO Foundation 108  demonstrates how DRE solutions can boost women's entrepreneurship and economic participation. It has empowered over 6,200 women in farming, food processing, textiles, and digital services across 24 states through energyefficient  technologies,  affordable  financing,  training,  market  linkages,  and  climateresilient infrastructure. Two such examples are discussed. Hundreds of women farmers in North Karnataka are advancing millet cultivation and local consumption through a solar-powered processing unit, boosting incomes and confidence for farmers, SHGs, and  Farmer  Producer  Organisations  (FPOs).  Similarly,  the Boipariguda-Sabujima FPO under Odisha's Millet Mission has adopted solar-powered processing, enhancing value capture, reducing costs, and fostering a productive, energy-reliable ecosystem.

12.63. The DRE solutions have the potential to improve well-being, cut energy costs, and strengthen local skills and financial inclusion while mitigating CO 2 emissions. With the right policies and strategies, the DRE solutions may be leveraged to address women entrepreneurs' challenges and support women-led livelihood.

## SKILL DEVELOPMENT: UPSKILLING, RESKILLING AND NEW SKILLING FOR A CHANGING WORLD

12.64. India's skilling and employment ecosystem is an ever-evolving framework shaped

by factors such as economic policies, technological advancements, globalisation, and the dynamic demands of the labour market. In the context of emerging global trends, including automation, generative AI, digitalisation, and climate change, aligning the nation's  skill  development  initiatives  with  the  anticipated  transformations  in  the labour market is vital. The increasing pace of these disruptive changes necessitates the establishment of a resilient and responsive skilled ecosystem. It is imperative to assess how well-prepared India's youth are for emerging opportunities. Box XII.7 discusses India's current skill landscape.

## Box XII.7: India's evolving skill landscape 109

A detailed examination of the annual PLFS 2023-24 unit-level data has been conducted to understand India's skill and job landscape here. The PLFS data shows that 90.2 per cent of the workforce has equivalent to or less than a secondary level of education. This educational skill composition, as a result, leads to most of the workforce (88.2 per cent) being involved in low-competency occupations- elementary skilled and semi-skilled occupational skills. 110

<!-- image -->

The  composition  of  skills  by  education  and  occupations  has  major  implications  on  the earnings of individuals and the economy. According to the PLFS data, there is a strong link between educational attainment, occupational roles, and income levels. While 4.2 per cent of the workforce, equipped with advanced education and specialised skills, earns between ₹4 lakh and ₹8 lakh annually, about 46 per cent earn less than ₹1 lakh, predominantly comprising  low  to  semi-skilled  workers  like  agricultural  labourers,  clerical  staff,  factory workers, and small-scale service providers. This highlights the urgent need for upskilling initiatives, considering the high concentration of India's workforce in lower-skilled roles.

Unlike general education, which tends to be broad and academic, Technical and Vocational Education  and  Training  (TVET)  in  India  offers  specialised  training  to  develop  practical skills required by specific industries or job roles. The PLFS 2023-24 reports data on the workforce's vocational training status. Notably, 65.3 per cent of the workforce received no form of vocational training.

## Challenges in the skill landscape

A key challenge in the skill  landscape  is  the  prevalence  of  low-skilled  workers,  which  is attributable to the quality of educational outcomes across different levels of education. Low educational skills in the workforce make a mismatch between their academic qualifications and  job  market  demands.  This  mismatch  has  resulted  in  over  53  per  cent  of  graduates and 36 per cent of postgraduates being underemployed in roles below their educational qualifications.

Table XII.4: Matrix of mismatch between education skills and occupations

| Education level/skills of workers   | Education level/skills of workers                                 | Education level/skills of workers                | Education level/skills of workers   | Education level/skills of workers   |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Occupational skill of workers       | Primary Education, or 10 years of education or informal education | Secondary Education, or 11-13 years of education | Graduate Degree                     | Postgraduate degree or above        |

Note: The figures in the table represent the percentage of the workforce with a specific educational skill level and the corresponding occupational skill where they are employed. For instance, the figure in the first cell (32.13 per cent) indicates that 32.13 per cent of the workforce that has attained up to primary education (10 years of education, or informal education) are employed in elementary-skill jobs.

The main diagonal cells represent the skill match between educational and occupational skills (green cells). Cells above the main diagonal represent workers employed below their educational qualifications (in blue), while  cells  below  the  main  diagonal  indicate  those  in  roles  exceeding  their  educational  qualifications  (in orange).

Skill  mismatch  can  result  from  imperfect  matching  between  employers  and  workers, primarily driven by labour market inefficiencies or an imbalance between aggregate supply and demand for specific skills. When the mismatch is due to the gap between the expected and actual skills of workers, it reflects a broader issue of misalignment between the demand for specific competencies and their availability in the labour force.

12.65.     Over time, there is an improvement in the proportion of skilled people across all  socio-economic  classifications,  including  rural,  urban  and  gender  classification. According to the PLFS report 2023-24, 4.9 per cent of the youth in the age cohort of 15-29 years have received formal vocational/technical training, while another 21.2 per cent received training through informal sources.  There is a significant improvement in the proportion of skilled people from 2018-19 to 2023-24 across all socio-economic classifications.

12.67.  India  has  made  progress  in  strengthening  its  skill  infrastructure.  The  SIDH, a  transformative  digital  portal,  leverages  the  digital  infrastructure  to  synergise  and empower the skill  ecosystem.  The  portal  is  a  key  step  forward  to  democratise  skill development with easy access to a diverse array of courses tailored to the demands of

the industry. The dual training system exposes trainees to an actual industry/workplace environment.

12.68. However,  even  with  the  government's  continued  efforts  to  evolve  the  skill landscape,  technological  advancements  are  rapidly  changing  the  nature  of  work and presenting new challenges. Advanced technologies such as automation, AI, and digitalisation  are  reshaping  industries  and  creating  demand  for  new  skill  sets.  This technological  transformation  underscores  the  need  for  a  dynamic,  forward-looking strategy that prepares the workforce for emerging opportunities.

12.69. A  robust  future  roadmap  must  prioritise  industry-academia  partnerships, continuous  skill  development,  and  flexible  learning  models  to  create  a  globally competitive  workforce.  Several  key  areas  require  focused  attention  and  strategic intervention to achieve this vision of a robust skilling ecosystem. The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has continuously brought initiatives to create a workforce matching the industry's demand ( Table XII.5 ).

12.70. There is a need to focus on improving learning outcomes and employability. The improvement in learning outcomes that translate into employability may need to be made on two levels. The first is at the school level, for basic language, mathematics, and  science  proficiency.  The  focus  on  Foundational  Literacy  and  Numeracy  (FLN) under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has already been discussed in the social chapter. Second at the higher education level, by incorporating skills that align with Industry 4.0 and new-age technologies like Generative AI and machine learning. Recognising this, the NEP 2020 aims to ensure that by 2025, at least 50 per cent of students in school and higher education gain exposure to skill education. Over the next decade, skill education will gradually become a part of all secondary schools.

12.71.  A strategic plan for skills and education is essential to leverage the demographic dividend and achieve the Viksit Bharat 2047 goals. Targeted schemes that incentivise skilling and employment creation can help bridge the skill gap by providing practical experience and promoting job generation through the right incentives.

12.72.  Early vocationalisation of education may be carried out to improve employability through  vocational  training.  This  will  enable  a  smooth  transition  from  learning  to the  job  market.  The  existing  ITIs  provide  formal  vocational  training.  The  relevance of the existing courses offered under the programme needs to be evaluated through a  placement and demand analysis under which placement uptake studies should be conducted to identify underperforming and redundant courses. Such courses should be replaced by courses catering to up-and-coming sectors such as AI, sustainability, Big data analytics, etc.

12.73.   The Union Budget 2024-25 introduced a package of five key schemes aimed at benefiting 4.1 crore youth over five years with a central outlay of ₹2 lakh crore to promote employment and skilling. These are discussed in Box XII.8.

## Box XII.8: Package of schemes for employment and skilling

Government announced the Prime Minister's package of five schemes and initiatives for employment, skilling, and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth over a 5-year period.  These schemes are a stepping stone towards creating long-term quality jobs for Viksit Bharat.

Scheme A - for first-timers: This initiative provides a one-month salary of up to ₹15,000 in three instalments to first-time employees, as registered in the EPFO. With a salary cap of ₹1 lakh per month, this scheme aims to support 2.1 crore youth entering the workforce for the first time.

Scheme B - Job Creation in manufacturing: An incentive will be provided at a specified scale  to  the  employee  and the employer directly with respect to the EPFO contributions made in the first four years of employment. This scheme incentivises job creation in the manufacturing sector.

Scheme C - Support to employers: Under the scheme, the government would reimburse up to ₹3,000 per month for two years towards the EPFO contribution of employers for each additional employee. This is expected to benefit 30 lakh youth and additional employment across all sectors.

New centrally sponsored scheme for skilling: 20 lakh youth to be skilled over a fiveyear period and 1,000 ITIs to be upgraded in hub and spoke arrangements. This is expected to boost the formation of skilled human capital, aiding in the generation of quality employment.

Prime Minister's Internship Scheme: Scheme for internship in 500 top companies to one crore youth in five years. This programme provides 12 months of real-life business exposure, with an internship allowance of ₹5,000 per month and one-time assistance of ₹6,000. This scheme aims to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry requirements and aligns with broader goals of improving employability and stimulating economic growth.

## Tiered skill framework and the importance of internship programmes

12.74.  The evolving transformations of the labour markets worldwide, and in India, revolve around the need for skilled workers, AI-ready workers, and workers who are ready even before they formally enter the job markets. The changing job market needs flexible  skill  strategies  to  keep  up  with  fast-moving  technologies  like  AI  and  large language models (LLMs). Policies should focus less on skilling for "AI jobs" and more on understanding how AI affects different tasks. In the future, most jobs will use AI, with some tasks fully automated and others made easier and more efficient. The impact of AI on employment has been discussed in detail in this survey in Chapter 13.

12.75.  Most  of  the  current  skill  policies  are  focused  on  re-skilling  and  up-skilling for AI jobs and roles or training on the use of AI. In order to re-skill and up-skill IT professionals to be adept with emerging technologies, the IT-ITeS Sector Skill Council, in partnership with MeitY, has launched the FutureSkills Prime platform, which aims at re-skilling/ up-skilling IT professionals in 10 new/emerging technologies including AI. The programme aims to up-skill/ re-skill 13.21 lakh beneficiaries up to March 2027, ensuring their continued relevance in a rapidly changing technological environment. Under  the  FutureSkills  Prime  programme,  119  courses  specifically  focused  on  the cutting-edge fields of AI. So far, 1.27 lakh individuals have been trained in various AIrelated courses and provided training to 1,236 government officials and 292 trainers. 112

12.76.  In addition to such programmes and courses, the skilling strategy needs to adopt a layered approach to address diverse industry demands and workforce needs effectively. This new approach could include skills tailored for specific tasks or job roles, targeted at selected groups of workers, and foundational AI skills provided universally to everyone and across all sectors. By aligning these skill tiers with the aspirations and needs of workers, the strategy can better prepare the workforce for a dynamic job landscape with changing demands. The tiered approach allows for training cost-effectively. The basic three tiers of the skill strategy are elaborated in Chart XII.24.

12.77.  Time is of the essence when picking up tasks in a workplace. In this context, education researchers and learning scientists have long recognised the importance of work-based learning or experiential learning. Scholars such as David Kolbs 113 , John Dewey 114  Kurt Lewis and others have been pioneers of experiential learning approaches, which have been proven to be important instruments in workforce development in various studies worldwide.

12.78. Internships are one such type of work-based learning aiming to provide skills in  a  professional  setting  alongside  gaining  career  and  life  experience.  Internships are  mutually  beneficial  arrangements  between  young  aspirants  and  employers. Advocates of this approach present many positives of hands-on experiences towards jobs  in  the  form  of  internships,  such  as  providing  real-world  contexts.  Internships hone communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. Recognising the importance of internships, the PM Internship scheme launched by the government is discussed in Box XII.9 .

## Box XII.9: PM Internship Scheme: Democratising the idea of learning by doing

The  Union  Budget  of  2024-25  announced  a  new  scheme  for  internship,  named  the  PM Internship Scheme (PMIS), in 500 top companies to one crore youth over a period of five years. The key aspects of the Scheme are:

- The internship opportunities span 24 sectors, including oil, gas, energy, travel, hospitality, automotive, banking and financial services, etc.
- 12-month paid internship  opportunities  with  top  companies  of  India  offered  to  those aged 21-24 years, from, and with educational qualifications ranging from matriculate to graduate (excluding IIT grads, CAs, etc.) are eligible to apply.  The scheme is specifically for Indian nationals who are not employed full-time or engaged in full-time education.
- The scheme offers a monthly stipend of ₹5000, funded jointly by the government (₹4500) and the company (₹500), with an additional ₹6000 for incidentals.

The scheme's pilot phase, launched on 3 October 2024, aims to benefit 1.25 lakh youth in FY25, with a five-year target of facilitating internships for one crore youth. Companies can also use their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds for expenditure under the scheme.

The scheme is being implemented through an online portal 115  developed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The portal is acting like a centralised platform for managing the entire internship lifecycle. The top companies for this pilot project have been identified voluntarily based on the average CSR expenditure of the last three years.

Industry partnership to tackle the skill-gap problem: This scheme will help bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry requirements and align with broader goals of improving employability, stimulating economic growth, and promoting sustainable development. It offers a market-led and youth-driven solution to the issue of constrained higher education, employment and training options to citizens residing in tier 2 or 3 cities, in keeping with the government's commitment to youth empowerment.

While internships are a norm in India's premier institutions and professional courses, they remain unusual in state universities and less famous colleges attended by most youth due to a lack of career counselling and job-oriented networking.

The democratisation of learning by doing: Mass-level internships through PMIS aims to level the playing field for youth from non-metro cities and act as door opener for potential placements. At a personal level, the newfound financial freedom will help boost confidence and motivate young minds to do better and aim higher. For young women, financial freedom and a sense of self-worth can alter life decisions, such as the age of marriage and pre-nuptial terms.

With 65 per cent of India's population residing in rural areas, as highlighted by the Economic Survey 2023-24, many regions remain disconnected from corporate prospects. To address this disparity and ensure inclusivity, the scheme encourages companies to leverage their forward and backward linkages, vendor networks, and MSMEs, providing a more equitable distribution of opportunities nationwide. In its pilot phase, the scheme facilitated over 1.27 lakh internship opportunities through 280 companies across 36 states and union territories, covering more than 740 districts.

What sets this Scheme apart is its independence from existing skill development schemes, apprenticeships,  and  student  training  initiatives  currently  implemented  across  all  states and union territories of India. By focusing solely on internships, the PIMS seeks to create a  tailored  experience  that  enhances  employability  and  gives  young  people  real-world exposure. Through this effort, the government aims to equip India's youth with the tools they need to thrive in the job market, fostering a skilled workforce ready to meet future challenges.  Ultimately,  this  initiative  reflects  a  commitment  to  nurturing  talent  and unlocking the potential of the next generation, contributing to the nation's overall growth and development. 116

For  young  aspirants,  internships  under  the  PMIS  are  not  only  opportunities  but  also transformative  experiences.  They  provide  exposure  to  the  real  world  of  corporate  work, which is quite dissimilar from the relatively more structured and stable world of academics as  taught  in  most  colleges  across  the  country.  Besides  developing  and  identifying  their optimal career path, aspirants can also get hands-on training in handling responsibility, problem-solving, decision-making, teamwork, and time management.

For the employer, internships are not just good low-cost experiments for testing a candidate's suitability for long-term employment but also a strategic tool for bridging the skills gap and

meeting its CSR mandate. Over 12 months, the company can credibly observe an intern's IQ and EQ and confidently hire deserving candidates.

For the economy at large, PMIS is aligned with the NEP 2020 and is a more immediate measure for promoting youth employment and bringing equity in employment prospects for youth from underprivileged backgrounds. By acting as a finishing school for young passouts, internships help reduce the economy's deadweight loss of 'talent sans employability'. Such a segue from education to employment would be crucial in the coming age of AI, where job suitability would be determined by adaptability to change and life skills. In the long run, it could also influence the capital-to-labour ratio in the manufacturing sector.

With over three lakh candidate profiles created and 6.5 lakh applications submitted, the PMIS Scheme has emerged as a transformative catalyst  for  employment  generation.  To fully harness India's demographic dividend, the scheme requires widespread publicity and meticulous implementation, continuously aiming at a better fit with India's demographic dividend. The high interest shown by corporates since the launch of the scheme augurs well for the success of the scheme's goal of skilling Indian youth, boosting their employability and the ultimate aim of enhancing their livelihoods.

12.79.  Along with internships, a public-private partnership for skill development and vocational training is another effective way of creating an industry-ready workforce. The Directorate General of Training, MSDE, has forged partnerships with industry leaders to enhance and upgrade training infrastructure. Notable collaborators include Dassault for aeronautical structure and equipment fitter, Pidilite and Jaguar for plumbing sector, Skoda for Automobile and HAL and Siemens for advanced CNC machinery training. 117

12.80. Building  a  resilient  skill  ecosystem  requires  a  collaborative  effort  from  all stakeholders. To navigate the evolving job market, job seekers must focus on developing industry-specific  skills.  Employers  should  prioritise  workforce  planning,  anticipate skill shortages, and understand the cost implications of adopting new technologies and regulatory standards. Trainers must design sector-specific programmes that address emerging  industry  needs  and  integrate  governance,  compliance,  and  innovation elements. A collaborative effort between job seekers, employers, and trainers will be crucial in navigating challenges and seizing opportunities in the future of work.

## International mobility of skilled workers

12.81.  India has a diaspora population of 32 million 118 , up from 18 million in 2020, making her one of the countries with the largest diaspora globally as of 2020. 119   There is  likely  to  be  a  demand for 97 million new jobs worldwide by 2025 in sectors such as healthcare, construction, IT, agriculture, and financial services, as estimated by the

117  Inputs from Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship

118  Population of Overseas Indians, MEA (https://tinyurl.com/mvupc9n6 )

119  International Migration 2020 Highlights, United Nations (https://tinyurl.com/y462r55p )

World Economic Forum (WEF). 120  With 65 per cent of its population under 35 years and a median age of 28, India's demographic dividend makes it a global talent hub, provided it can cultivate a workforce with employable, industry-relevant skills.

12.82. By  creating  a  skilling  ecosystem  with  a  high-quality,  globally  competitive workforce, India can enhance employability for youth in global job markets. This attracts international  investments,  stimulates  growth,  drives  innovation,  and  strengthens India's global economic position. Skill development is key to ' Aatmanirbhar Bharat ,' ensuring the workforce has the competencies to meet evolving industry demands and global standards. The government is taking several measures to facilitate skilled labour mobility internationally, as elaborated in Box XII.10 .

## Box XII.10: International cooperation in skill development

- Bilateral partnerships are key to facilitating skill-based pathways for the migration of India's workforce. The Indian Government, through the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), with agreements like Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreements (MMPA), Labour  Mobility  Agreements  (LMA),  and  Labour  Welfare  Agreements ensure skill alignment, worker rights, pre-departure support and forecast sector-specific demands fostering safe and sustainable international employment opportunities. MMPAs and LMAs with eight countries, including Australia, Israel, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the UK, Japan, and Austria, focus on vocational training and skill alignment.
-  The MSDE has seven active G2G Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with Australia,  Denmark,  Germany,  Japan,  Qatar,  Singapore,  and  the  UAE.  These  MoUs focus  on  skill  development,  vocational  training,  capacity  building,  and  international certification, enhancing the global mobility of skilled Indian workers and promoting the recognition of Indian qualifications abroad. By fostering technical collaboration, these partnerships align skilling outcomes with international standards, facilitate information exchange, and contribute to creating a globally benchmarked skills ecosystem.
-  MSDE,  via  the  National  Skill  Development  Council  (NSDC),  conducts skill  gap assessments in  16  countries,  including  the  USA,  Canada,  and  the  UAE,  and  studies global practices through Sector Skill Councils (SSCs). India also emphasises training for international  mobility,  offering  domain-specific,  foreign  language,  and  Recognition  of Prior Learning programmes to address skill gaps in emerging fields like AI and robotics. PMKVY and Craftsmen Scheme include language training to improve worker integration abroad.
-  Curriculum  development  under  the National  Skills  Qualification  Framework (NSQF) ensures alignment with international standards, enhancing employability and mutual recognition of qualifications.
- Skill India International Centres, designed as hubs for global job seekers, will reduce the time and cost of international mobility with the goal of establishing a 'Trusted

Workforce  Supply  Chain'.  Currently,  two  SIICs  are  operational  in  Varanasi  and Bhubaneswar, with five more under renovation.

- The Pre-Departure Orientation Training programme, launched in 2018, provides free  8-hour  training  to  migrant  workers  on  destination  countries'  cultural,  legal,  and welfare aspects.
-  The MEA's e-Migrate platform streamlines emigration by connecting stakeholders and offering services like online registration, PDOT, and grievance redressal. Currently, 2,171 recruiting agents and 284,345 employers are registered on the platform.

12.83. As  the  way  forward  to  tap  the  global  demand,  there  is  need  to  periodically conduct regular detailed demand-supply analyses to map global skill gaps and align skilling programmes with international labour market needs.

## CONCLUSION

12.84. In conclusion, India has seen good growth in employment in recent years, as highlighted  by  labour  market  indicators  that  show  strong  signs  of  post-pandemic recovery and increased formalisation of the economy. This growth can be attributed to notable achievements in entrepreneurship, formalisation, skill development, and the transformation of the regulatory framework.

12.85. Labour laws intended to protect the rights of women workers have, more often than  not,  discouraged  hiring  by  creating  systemic  barriers  to  their  entry  into  the workforce. India's new Labour Codes address this by enabling night shifts for women with safety measures, extending 26 weeks of maternity leave to gig and informal workers and mandating creche facilities in workplaces with 50 or more employees. The Codes ensure  equal  pay  and  prohibit  gender  discrimination  in  recruitment  while  allowing women to work in all sectors, including hazardous roles, with safeguards. These reforms will promote gender inclusivity, workplace safety, and social security for women.

12.86. By simplifying compliance, fostering labour flexibility, and promoting worker welfare, labour reforms have created an enabling environment that balances ease of doing business with the protection of worker rights. Together, these measures foster a  'virtuous  cycle  of  job  creation,'  supporting  sustainable  employment  growth  and economic inclusivity. Chapter 5 of the survey 'Medium Term Outlook' discusses in detail the important role of deregulation in the economy. Deregulation, in general, whether or not related to labour, will boost employment because it helps lower the cost of doing business and allows for the resource to be used for expanding capacity through more labour and more and better equipment.
