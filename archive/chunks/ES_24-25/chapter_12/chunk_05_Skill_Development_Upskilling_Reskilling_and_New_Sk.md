# Skill Development: Upskilling, Reskilling and New Skilling for a Changing World

SKILL DEVELOPMENT: UPSKILLING, RESKILLING AND NEW SKILLING FOR A CHANGING WORLD

12.64. India's skilling and employment ecosystem is an ever-evolving framework shaped

by factors such as economic policies, technological advancements, globalisation, and the dynamic demands of the labour market. In the context of emerging global trends, including automation, generative AI, digitalisation, and climate change, aligning the nation's  skill  development  initiatives  with  the  anticipated  transformations  in  the labour market is vital. The increasing pace of these disruptive changes necessitates the establishment of a resilient and responsive skilled ecosystem. It is imperative to assess how well-prepared India's youth are for emerging opportunities. Box XII.7 discusses India's current skill landscape.

## Box XII.7: India's evolving skill landscape 109

A detailed examination of the annual PLFS 2023-24 unit-level data has been conducted to understand India's skill and job landscape here. The PLFS data shows that 90.2 per cent of the workforce has equivalent to or less than a secondary level of education. This educational skill composition, as a result, leads to most of the workforce (88.2 per cent) being involved in low-competency occupations- elementary skilled and semi-skilled occupational skills. 110

The  composition  of  skills  by  education  and  occupations  has  major  implications  on  the earnings of individuals and the economy. According to the PLFS data, there is a strong link between educational attainment, occupational roles, and income levels. While 4.2 per cent of the workforce, equipped with advanced education and specialised skills, earns between ₹4 lakh and ₹8 lakh annually, about 46 per cent earn less than ₹1 lakh, predominantly comprising  low  to  semi-skilled  workers  like  agricultural  labourers,  clerical  staff,  factory workers, and small-scale service providers. This highlights the urgent need for upskilling initiatives, considering the high concentration of India's workforce in lower-skilled roles.

Unlike general education, which tends to be broad and academic, Technical and Vocational Education  and  Training  (TVET)  in  India  offers  specialised  training  to  develop  practical skills required by specific industries or job roles. The PLFS 2023-24 reports data on the workforce's vocational training status. Notably, 65.3 per cent of the workforce received no form of vocational training.

## Challenges in the skill landscape

A key challenge in the skill  landscape  is  the  prevalence  of  low-skilled  workers,  which  is attributable to the quality of educational outcomes across different levels of education. Low educational skills in the workforce make a mismatch between their academic qualifications and  job  market  demands.  This  mismatch  has  resulted  in  over  53  per  cent  of  graduates and 36 per cent of postgraduates being underemployed in roles below their educational qualifications.

Table XII.4: Matrix of mismatch between education skills and occupations

| Education level/skills of workers   | Education level/skills of workers                                 | Education level/skills of workers                | Education level/skills of workers   | Education level/skills of workers   |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Occupational skill of workers       | Primary Education, or 10 years of education or informal education | Secondary Education, or 11-13 years of education | Graduate Degree                     | Postgraduate degree or above        |
| Elementary skill                    | 32.13                                                             | 19.25                                            | 3.22                                | 0.96                                |
| Semi-skilled                        | 66.3                                                              | 72.18                                            | 50.3                                | 28.12                               |
| High competency skill               | 0.29                                                              | 2.79                                             | 8.25                                | 7.67                                |
| Specialised skills                  | 1.28                                                              | 5.77                                             | 38.23                               | 63.26                               |

Note: The figures in the table represent the percentage of the workforce with a specific educational skill level and the corresponding occupational skill where they are employed. For instance, the figure in the first cell (32.13 per cent) indicates that 32.13 per cent of the workforce that has attained up to primary education (10 years of education, or informal education) are employed in elementary-skill jobs.

The main diagonal cells represent the skill match between educational and occupational skills (green cells). Cells above the main diagonal represent workers employed below their educational qualifications (in blue), while  cells  below  the  main  diagonal  indicate  those  in  roles  exceeding  their  educational  qualifications  (in orange).

Skill  mismatch  can  result  from  imperfect  matching  between  employers  and  workers, primarily driven by labour market inefficiencies or an imbalance between aggregate supply and demand for specific skills. When the mismatch is due to the gap between the expected and actual skills of workers, it reflects a broader issue of misalignment between the demand for specific competencies and their availability in the labour force.

12.65.     Over time, there is an improvement in the proportion of skilled people across all  socio-economic  classifications,  including  rural,  urban  and  gender  classification. According to the PLFS report 2023-24, 4.9 per cent of the youth in the age cohort of 15-29 years have received formal vocational/technical training, while another 21.2 per cent received training through informal sources.  There is a significant improvement in the proportion of skilled people from 2018-19 to 2023-24 across all socio-economic classifications.

12.67.  India  has  made  progress  in  strengthening  its  skill  infrastructure.  The  SIDH, a  transformative  digital  portal,  leverages  the  digital  infrastructure  to  synergise  and empower the skill  ecosystem.  The  portal  is  a  key  step  forward  to  democratise  skill development with easy access to a diverse array of courses tailored to the demands of

the industry. The dual training system exposes trainees to an actual industry/workplace environment.

12.68. However,  even  with  the  government's  continued  efforts  to  evolve  the  skill landscape,  technological  advancements  are  rapidly  changing  the  nature  of  work and presenting new challenges. Advanced technologies such as automation, AI, and digitalisation  are  reshaping  industries  and  creating  demand  for  new  skill  sets.  This technological  transformation  underscores  the  need  for  a  dynamic,  forward-looking strategy that prepares the workforce for emerging opportunities.

12.69. A  robust  future  roadmap  must  prioritise  industry-academia  partnerships, continuous  skill  development,  and  flexible  learning  models  to  create  a  globally competitive  workforce.  Several  key  areas  require  focused  attention  and  strategic intervention to achieve this vision of a robust skilling ecosystem. The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE) has continuously brought initiatives to create a workforce matching the industry's demand ( Table XII.5 ).

12.70. There is a need to focus on improving learning outcomes and employability. The improvement in learning outcomes that translate into employability may need to be made on two levels. The first is at the school level, for basic language, mathematics, and  science  proficiency.  The  focus  on  Foundational  Literacy  and  Numeracy  (FLN) under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 has already been discussed in the social chapter. Second at the higher education level, by incorporating skills that align with Industry 4.0 and new-age technologies like Generative AI and machine learning. Recognising this, the NEP 2020 aims to ensure that by 2025, at least 50 per cent of students in school and higher education gain exposure to skill education. Over the next decade, skill education will gradually become a part of all secondary schools.

12.71.  A strategic plan for skills and education is essential to leverage the demographic dividend and achieve the Viksit Bharat 2047 goals. Targeted schemes that incentivise skilling and employment creation can help bridge the skill gap by providing practical experience and promoting job generation through the right incentives.

12.72.  Early vocationalisation of education may be carried out to improve employability through  vocational  training.  This  will  enable  a  smooth  transition  from  learning  to the  job  market.  The  existing  ITIs  provide  formal  vocational  training.  The  relevance of the existing courses offered under the programme needs to be evaluated through a  placement and demand analysis under which placement uptake studies should be conducted to identify underperforming and redundant courses. Such courses should be replaced by courses catering to up-and-coming sectors such as AI, sustainability, Big data analytics, etc.

12.73.   The Union Budget 2024-25 introduced a package of five key schemes aimed at benefiting 4.1 crore youth over five years with a central outlay of ₹2 lakh crore to promote employment and skilling. These are discussed in Box XII.8.

## Box XII.8: Package of schemes for employment and skilling

Government announced the Prime Minister's package of five schemes and initiatives for employment, skilling, and other opportunities for 4.1 crore youth over a 5-year period.  These schemes are a stepping stone towards creating long-term quality jobs for Viksit Bharat.

Scheme A - for first-timers: This initiative provides a one-month salary of up to ₹15,000 in three instalments to first-time employees, as registered in the EPFO. With a salary cap of ₹1 lakh per month, this scheme aims to support 2.1 crore youth entering the workforce for the first time.

Scheme B - Job Creation in manufacturing: An incentive will be provided at a specified scale  to  the  employee  and the employer directly with respect to the EPFO contributions made in the first four years of employment. This scheme incentivises job creation in the manufacturing sector.

Scheme C - Support to employers: Under the scheme, the government would reimburse up to ₹3,000 per month for two years towards the EPFO contribution of employers for each additional employee. This is expected to benefit 30 lakh youth and additional employment across all sectors.

New centrally sponsored scheme for skilling: 20 lakh youth to be skilled over a fiveyear period and 1,000 ITIs to be upgraded in hub and spoke arrangements. This is expected to boost the formation of skilled human capital, aiding in the generation of quality employment.

Prime Minister's Internship Scheme: Scheme for internship in 500 top companies to one crore youth in five years. This programme provides 12 months of real-life business exposure, with an internship allowance of ₹5,000 per month and one-time assistance of ₹6,000. This scheme aims to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry requirements and aligns with broader goals of improving employability and stimulating economic growth.

## Tiered skill framework and the importance of internship programmes

12.74.  The evolving transformations of the labour markets worldwide, and in India, revolve around the need for skilled workers, AI-ready workers, and workers who are ready even before they formally enter the job markets. The changing job market needs flexible  skill  strategies  to  keep  up  with  fast-moving  technologies  like  AI  and  large language models (LLMs). Policies should focus less on skilling for "AI jobs" and more on understanding how AI affects different tasks. In the future, most jobs will use AI, with some tasks fully automated and others made easier and more efficient. The impact of AI on employment has been discussed in detail in this survey in Chapter 13.

12.75.  Most  of  the  current  skill  policies  are  focused  on  re-skilling  and  up-skilling for AI jobs and roles or training on the use of AI. In order to re-skill and up-skill IT professionals to be adept with emerging technologies, the IT-ITeS Sector Skill Council, in partnership with MeitY, has launched the FutureSkills Prime platform, which aims at re-skilling/ up-skilling IT professionals in 10 new/emerging technologies including AI. The programme aims to up-skill/ re-skill 13.21 lakh beneficiaries up to March 2027, ensuring their continued relevance in a rapidly changing technological environment. Under  the  FutureSkills  Prime  programme,  119  courses  specifically  focused  on  the cutting-edge fields of AI. So far, 1.27 lakh individuals have been trained in various AIrelated courses and provided training to 1,236 government officials and 292 trainers. 112

12.76.  In addition to such programmes and courses, the skilling strategy needs to adopt a layered approach to address diverse industry demands and workforce needs effectively. This new approach could include skills tailored for specific tasks or job roles, targeted at selected groups of workers, and foundational AI skills provided universally to everyone and across all sectors. By aligning these skill tiers with the aspirations and needs of workers, the strategy can better prepare the workforce for a dynamic job landscape with changing demands. The tiered approach allows for training cost-effectively. The basic three tiers of the skill strategy are elaborated in Chart XII.24.

12.77.  Time is of the essence when picking up tasks in a workplace. In this context, education researchers and learning scientists have long recognised the importance of work-based learning or experiential learning. Scholars such as David Kolbs 113 , John Dewey 114  Kurt Lewis and others have been pioneers of experiential learning approaches, which have been proven to be important instruments in workforce development in various studies worldwide.

12.78. Internships are one such type of work-based learning aiming to provide skills in  a  professional  setting  alongside  gaining  career  and  life  experience.  Internships are  mutually  beneficial  arrangements  between  young  aspirants  and  employers. Advocates of this approach present many positives of hands-on experiences towards jobs  in  the  form  of  internships,  such  as  providing  real-world  contexts.  Internships hone communication, collaboration, creativity, and critical thinking. Recognising the importance of internships, the PM Internship scheme launched by the government is discussed in Box XII.9 .

## Box XII.9: PM Internship Scheme: Democratising the idea of learning by doing

The  Union  Budget  of  2024-25  announced  a  new  scheme  for  internship,  named  the  PM Internship Scheme (PMIS), in 500 top companies to one crore youth over a period of five years. The key aspects of the Scheme are:

- The internship opportunities span 24 sectors, including oil, gas, energy, travel, hospitality, automotive, banking and financial services, etc.
- 12-month paid internship  opportunities  with  top  companies  of  India  offered  to  those aged 21-24 years, from, and with educational qualifications ranging from matriculate to graduate (excluding IIT grads, CAs, etc.) are eligible to apply.  The scheme is specifically for Indian nationals who are not employed full-time or engaged in full-time education.
- The scheme offers a monthly stipend of ₹5000, funded jointly by the government (₹4500) and the company (₹500), with an additional ₹6000 for incidentals.

The scheme's pilot phase, launched on 3 October 2024, aims to benefit 1.25 lakh youth in FY25, with a five-year target of facilitating internships for one crore youth. Companies can also use their corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds for expenditure under the scheme.

The scheme is being implemented through an online portal 115  developed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs. The portal is acting like a centralised platform for managing the entire internship lifecycle. The top companies for this pilot project have been identified voluntarily based on the average CSR expenditure of the last three years.

Industry partnership to tackle the skill-gap problem: This scheme will help bridge the gap between academic knowledge and industry requirements and align with broader goals of improving employability, stimulating economic growth, and promoting sustainable development. It offers a market-led and youth-driven solution to the issue of constrained higher education, employment and training options to citizens residing in tier 2 or 3 cities, in keeping with the government's commitment to youth empowerment.

While internships are a norm in India's premier institutions and professional courses, they remain unusual in state universities and less famous colleges attended by most youth due to a lack of career counselling and job-oriented networking.

The democratisation of learning by doing: Mass-level internships through PMIS aims to level the playing field for youth from non-metro cities and act as door opener for potential placements. At a personal level, the newfound financial freedom will help boost confidence and motivate young minds to do better and aim higher. For young women, financial freedom and a sense of self-worth can alter life decisions, such as the age of marriage and pre-nuptial terms.

With 65 per cent of India's population residing in rural areas, as highlighted by the Economic Survey 2023-24, many regions remain disconnected from corporate prospects. To address this disparity and ensure inclusivity, the scheme encourages companies to leverage their forward and backward linkages, vendor networks, and MSMEs, providing a more equitable distribution of opportunities nationwide. In its pilot phase, the scheme facilitated over 1.27 lakh internship opportunities through 280 companies across 36 states and union territories, covering more than 740 districts.

What sets this Scheme apart is its independence from existing skill development schemes, apprenticeships,  and  student  training  initiatives  currently  implemented  across  all  states and union territories of India. By focusing solely on internships, the PIMS seeks to create a  tailored  experience  that  enhances  employability  and  gives  young  people  real-world exposure. Through this effort, the government aims to equip India's youth with the tools they need to thrive in the job market, fostering a skilled workforce ready to meet future challenges.  Ultimately,  this  initiative  reflects  a  commitment  to  nurturing  talent  and unlocking the potential of the next generation, contributing to the nation's overall growth and development. 116

For  young  aspirants,  internships  under  the  PMIS  are  not  only  opportunities  but  also transformative  experiences.  They  provide  exposure  to  the  real  world  of  corporate  work, which is quite dissimilar from the relatively more structured and stable world of academics as  taught  in  most  colleges  across  the  country.  Besides  developing  and  identifying  their optimal career path, aspirants can also get hands-on training in handling responsibility, problem-solving, decision-making, teamwork, and time management.

For the employer, internships are not just good low-cost experiments for testing a candidate's suitability for long-term employment but also a strategic tool for bridging the skills gap and

meeting its CSR mandate. Over 12 months, the company can credibly observe an intern's IQ and EQ and confidently hire deserving candidates.

For the economy at large, PMIS is aligned with the NEP 2020 and is a more immediate measure for promoting youth employment and bringing equity in employment prospects for youth from underprivileged backgrounds. By acting as a finishing school for young passouts, internships help reduce the economy's deadweight loss of 'talent sans employability'. Such a segue from education to employment would be crucial in the coming age of AI, where job suitability would be determined by adaptability to change and life skills. In the long run, it could also influence the capital-to-labour ratio in the manufacturing sector.

With over three lakh candidate profiles created and 6.5 lakh applications submitted, the PMIS Scheme has emerged as a transformative catalyst  for  employment  generation.  To fully harness India's demographic dividend, the scheme requires widespread publicity and meticulous implementation, continuously aiming at a better fit with India's demographic dividend. The high interest shown by corporates since the launch of the scheme augurs well for the success of the scheme's goal of skilling Indian youth, boosting their employability and the ultimate aim of enhancing their livelihoods.

12.79.  Along with internships, a public-private partnership for skill development and vocational training is another effective way of creating an industry-ready workforce. The Directorate General of Training, MSDE, has forged partnerships with industry leaders to enhance and upgrade training infrastructure. Notable collaborators include Dassault for aeronautical structure and equipment fitter, Pidilite and Jaguar for plumbing sector, Skoda for Automobile and HAL and Siemens for advanced CNC machinery training. 117

12.80. Building  a  resilient  skill  ecosystem  requires  a  collaborative  effort  from  all stakeholders. To navigate the evolving job market, job seekers must focus on developing industry-specific  skills.  Employers  should  prioritise  workforce  planning,  anticipate skill shortages, and understand the cost implications of adopting new technologies and regulatory standards. Trainers must design sector-specific programmes that address emerging  industry  needs  and  integrate  governance,  compliance,  and  innovation elements. A collaborative effort between job seekers, employers, and trainers will be crucial in navigating challenges and seizing opportunities in the future of work.

## International mobility of skilled workers

12.81.  India has a diaspora population of 32 million 118 , up from 18 million in 2020, making her one of the countries with the largest diaspora globally as of 2020. 119   There is  likely  to  be  a  demand for 97 million new jobs worldwide by 2025 in sectors such as healthcare, construction, IT, agriculture, and financial services, as estimated by the

World Economic Forum (WEF). 120  With 65 per cent of its population under 35 years and a median age of 28, India's demographic dividend makes it a global talent hub, provided it can cultivate a workforce with employable, industry-relevant skills.

12.82. By  creating  a  skilling  ecosystem  with  a  high-quality,  globally  competitive workforce, India can enhance employability for youth in global job markets. This attracts international  investments,  stimulates  growth,  drives  innovation,  and  strengthens India's global economic position. Skill development is key to ' Aatmanirbhar Bharat ,' ensuring the workforce has the competencies to meet evolving industry demands and global standards. The government is taking several measures to facilitate skilled labour mobility internationally, as elaborated in Box XII.10 .

## Box XII.10: International cooperation in skill development

- Bilateral partnerships are key to facilitating skill-based pathways for the migration of India's workforce. The Indian Government, through the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), with agreements like Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreements (MMPA), Labour  Mobility  Agreements  (LMA),  and  Labour  Welfare  Agreements ensure skill alignment, worker rights, pre-departure support and forecast sector-specific demands fostering safe and sustainable international employment opportunities. MMPAs and LMAs with eight countries, including Australia, Israel, Denmark, Italy, Germany, the UK, Japan, and Austria, focus on vocational training and skill alignment.
-  The MSDE has seven active G2G Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with Australia,  Denmark,  Germany,  Japan,  Qatar,  Singapore,  and  the  UAE.  These  MoUs focus  on  skill  development,  vocational  training,  capacity  building,  and  international certification, enhancing the global mobility of skilled Indian workers and promoting the recognition of Indian qualifications abroad. By fostering technical collaboration, these partnerships align skilling outcomes with international standards, facilitate information exchange, and contribute to creating a globally benchmarked skills ecosystem.
-  MSDE,  via  the  National  Skill  Development  Council  (NSDC),  conducts skill  gap assessments in  16  countries,  including  the  USA,  Canada,  and  the  UAE,  and  studies global practices through Sector Skill Councils (SSCs). India also emphasises training for international  mobility,  offering  domain-specific,  foreign  language,  and  Recognition  of Prior Learning programmes to address skill gaps in emerging fields like AI and robotics. PMKVY and Craftsmen Scheme include language training to improve worker integration abroad.
-  Curriculum  development  under  the National  Skills  Qualification  Framework (NSQF) ensures alignment with international standards, enhancing employability and mutual recognition of qualifications.
- Skill India International Centres, designed as hubs for global job seekers, will reduce the time and cost of international mobility with the goal of establishing a 'Trusted

Workforce  Supply  Chain'.  Currently,  two  SIICs  are  operational  in  Varanasi  and Bhubaneswar, with five more under renovation.

- The Pre-Departure Orientation Training programme, launched in 2018, provides free  8-hour  training  to  migrant  workers  on  destination  countries'  cultural,  legal,  and welfare aspects.
-  The MEA's e-Migrate platform streamlines emigration by connecting stakeholders and offering services like online registration, PDOT, and grievance redressal. Currently, 2,171 recruiting agents and 284,345 employers are registered on the platform.

12.83. As  the  way  forward  to  tap  the  global  demand,  there  is  need  to  periodically conduct regular detailed demand-supply analyses to map global skill gaps and align skilling programmes with international labour market needs.
