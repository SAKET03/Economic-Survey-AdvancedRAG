# Job Creation: Action Towards Enhanced Employment Opportunities

JOB CREATION: ACTION TOWARDS ENHANCED EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES

## Security vs. Flexibility: The role of regulation in job creation

12.43. One key aspect of creating an enabling environment for businesses to grow is improving the ease of doing business and increasing flexibility in the labour market. In this regard, the government has worked to simplify labour laws. These reforms aim to  foster  job  creation,  enhance  transparency, and improve accountability within the system. Box XII.4 informs about the progress on this front.

## Box XII.4: Labour laws strengthening workers' rights

The central government has formulated four Labour Codes, namely, the Code on Wages, 2019;  the  Code  on  Social  Security,  2020;  the  Industrial  Relations  Code,  2020;  and  the Occupational  Safety,  Health,  and  Working  Conditions  Code,  2020  after  simplifying, rationalising, and amalgamating the 29 existing central laws. The Code on Wages, 2019, was notified on 8 August 2019, and the remaining three Codes were notified on 29 September 2020.

The  new  Labour  Codes  constitute  a  significant  step  for  workers'  rights  in  India  by strengthening the protection available to workers, including unorganised workers, regarding statutory  minimum  wage  and  its  timely  payment,  social  security,  occupational  safety, healthcare of workers, etc. The central government and 29 states/UTs have pre-published their draft rules under the four Labour Codes. Some of the remaining seven states/UTs have pre-published their draft rules for one or more Labour Codes.

Many states have already carried out various reforms in the spirit of the Labour Codes, such as:

- (a) Increasing the threshold of the number of workers from 100 to 300 for prior approval of appropriate government before retrenchment/ layoff/ closure of establishments in factory/plantation/ mining sector has been done by 14 states viz., Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh (AP), Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand, Madhya  Pradesh  (MP),  Uttar  Pradesh  (UP),  Meghalaya,  Punjab  and  Odisha  under existing Industrial Disputes Act.  Himachal Pradesh (HP) has increased it to 200.
- (b) Six states viz. Bihar, Haryana, Goa, Punjab, Odisha, and HP have notified Fixed Term Employment under the existing Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946.

- (c) 15  states/UTs  viz.  Maharashtra,  Goa,  Haryana,  Odisha,  J&amp;K,  HP,  Punjab,  UP, Uttarakhand, West Bengal, MP, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Assam have allowed women to work in night shifts subject to fulfilment of safety provisions.
- (d) 12  states/UTs  viz.  Gujarat,  Maharashtra,  Andhra  Pradesh,  UP,  Odisha,  Rajasthan, Haryana, Goa, MP, Uttarakhand, Bihar, and Punjab increased the threshold from 20 to 50 for applicability of the Contract Labour (Regulation &amp; Abolition) Act, 1970. J&amp;K and Ladakh increased the threshold from 20 to 40, and Himachal Pradesh increased the threshold to 30.
- (e) 14 states/UTs viz. Haryana, Gujarat, Punjab, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Andhra Pradesh, J&amp;K, Ladakh, Bihar, HP, Assam, Odisha, Manipur, and Jharkhand have increased the threshold for applicability of the Factories Act from 10 to 20(with power).
- (f) 16 states/UTs viz. Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Goa, Gujarat, Haryana, HP, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Maharashtra, MP, Meghalaya, Punjab, Rajasthan and UP have already increased the threshold for applicability of the Factories Act from 20 to  40(without  power).  This  increase  in  the  threshold  is  significant  as  it  extends the protection of the Factories Act to a larger number of workers, thereby enhancing workplace safety and labour rights.
- (g) Seven states viz. Maharashtra, Haryana, HP, Odisha, Punjab, Karnataka and UP have increased the ceiling of overtime hours from 75 up to 144 hours in any quarter.

12.44. Labour  regulations  play  a  significant  role  in  safeguarding  worker  rights  and holding  firms  accountable  for  their  working  conditions.  The  regulatory  framework not  only  shapes  the  business  environment  and  the  competitive  dynamics  of  firms and factories but also ensures workers' well-being. Among these, Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) regulations stand out as foundational measures to ensure secure and dignified working conditions, providing a sense of security and confidence to the workforce.

12.45.  Business experts, governments, economists, and management academics have repeatedly advocated for the role of working conditions, especially worker safety and well-being, in improving worker productivity. The role of OSH in enhancing worker productivity is discussed in Box XII.5 .

## Box XII.5: Occupational safety and health, labour productivity, and the role of Labour Laws.

OSH regulations 70  not only protect workers but also enhance efficiency and productivity. These regulations can be viewed as an investment in the long-term health of businesses and the economy. Literature and studies show that improving working conditions and implementing

70    The  Occupational  Safety,  Health  and  Working  Conditions  Code,  2020  has  been  notified  to  consolidate  and amend the laws regulating the occupational safety, health and working conditions of the persons employed in an establishment. https://tinyurl.com/25j6hxw2

OSH improve the GDP. The role of OSH in improving worker productivity is significant. This positive correlation underscores the importance of focusing on the effective implementation of OSH laws, as it directly contributes to increased productivity and economic growth. 71

The labour laws for OSH have been in place since the Factories Act of 1948, and over time, new regulations have been brought in with the Employees' State Insurance Act of 1948 and the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of  Service)  Act  of  1996.  The  new  Occupational  Safety,  Health,  and  Working  Conditions (OSH&amp;WC)  Code,  2020  has  introduced  several  worker-friendly  provisions  to  enhance occupational safety, health, and labour productivity. 72

India's manufacturing (11.4 per cent of total workforce) and construction (12 per cent of total  workforce)  workforce  are  prone  to  workplace  accidents.  The  Directorate  General Factory Advice Service &amp; Labour Institute (DGFASLI) monitors injuries in factories and major industries. Its data notes a decline in reported industrial injuries since 2015. 73  The number of injuries has reduced from 5500 in 2015 to 2365 in 2020.

## Challenges

While the National Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct (NGRBC) 74  emphasise the role of businesses in ensuring OSH in supply chains, many leading corporations have yet to effectively implement these principles, as highlighted in Safe in India Foundations (SII's) 75

SafetyNiti reports. The report highlights the prevalence of injuries due to inadequate safety sensors and audit and training lapses in the automobile sector, as an example. 76

This  underscores  the  need  for  the  industry  to  improve  focus  on  prevention,  training, and compliance through monitoring and audits. Enlightened self-interest and long-term thinking require employers to realise that a safe, secure, and satisfactory workplace is the key to long-term employee morale and productivity. Ethical conduct and fairness in business are the signs and bedrock of a mature and developed society. Treating workers humanely and, providing for their safety and looking after them when injured make as much business sense as it is the fair and ethical thing to do. Industry associations and collective bodies must champion this cause among their members. Addressing these challenges would be essential to fostering a robust and safe working environment across industries.

## Way ahead

Technology-Driven Solutions: App-based worker reporting, can significantly enhance monitoring efforts. A good example is the Philippines' Online Labour Inspection System, which serves as a centralised digital platform for submitting safety records and accessing necessary templates. 77  The Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) data can help identify  unsafe  hotspots,  enabling  targeted  actions.  Additionally,  incorporating  a  safety module in the ASI would improve the quality of safety data.

Utilising  wearable  technology  in  accident-prone  areas,  adopting  the  internet  of  things (IoT) for risk detection in MSMEs, and offering affordable virtual reality training modules can greatly enhance safety standards. Additionally, employing blockchain technology for tracking of claims will improve the transparency of ESIC claims and audits.

More substantial Incentives: Implementing tiered safety protocols for various industries and simplifying regulations for smaller businesses can encourage compliance. Incentives such as safety awards, tax breaks, and a machine safety subsidy programme can motivate industries to enhance their safety measures. An example of this is South Korea's Voluntary Safety Certification. 78  Furthermore, shared safety officers and subsidised training through public-private partnerships can further bolster industry support. For example, Thailand's Industrial Estate Authority provides shared safety services for industrial zones, including training, inspections, and safety audits. 79

By adopting these measures aligned with occupational safety, health, and well-being, India can drive its manufacturing goals sustainably, thereby improving worker dignity, increasing business profitability, and enhancing labour productivity.

12.46. India's  labour  regulations  impose  extensive  compliance  requirements  on businesses  (Rajagopalan  &amp;  Shah,  2024). 80   For  example,  the  Factories  Act  of  1948 mandates  the  placement  of  spittoons,  specifies  the  materials  for  toilet  paper,  and dictates the design of washrooms. Similarly, other laws, like the Minimum Wages Act (1948) and the Maternity Benefit Act (1961), impose detailed specifications, through Rules, on register paper colours, font sizes on wage slips, and the distance between work areas and crèche facilities. Rather than focusing on essential safety and hygiene standards, these micromanaging regulations create unnecessary administrative burdens that hinder business growth. Implications of some of the laws on workers and firms are summarised in Box XII.6 .

## Box XII.6: Flexible labour regulations: Striking a balance for employment growth

Fostering  an  enabling  environment  that  supports  business  growth  is  crucial  for  driving employment  and  economic  development.  However,  there  are  instances  where  labour regulations  designed  to  protect  workers'  rights  perhaps  inadvertently  hinder  the  growth of  firms,  especially  small  and  medium  enterprises,  by  restricting  their  ability  to  expand operations when needed compared to global peers. In doing so, it dampens employment generation as well. Some such examples are presented here:

## Inflexible working hours

Section 51 of the Factories Act (1948) states, ' No adult worker shall be required or allowed to work in a factory for more than forty-eight hours in any week.' This clause limits the number of hours a worker can work in a day and a week. However, unlike India, certain countries allow these caps to be averaged over multiple days and weeks.

80    Shruti  Rajagopalan  and  Kadambari  Shah.  'Why  Indian  Firms  Don't  Scale:  Labor  Edition.'  Mercatus  Policy Research, Mercatus Center at George Mason University, Arlington, VA, September 2024. (https://tinyurl.com/37ep929p ).

<!-- image -->

India's working hour regulations prevent manufacturers from meeting demand surges and participating in global markets. Manufacturers stay competitive by minimising the time to bring a product to the market (Afonso et al., 2000; Vesey, 1991). 82

To  reduce  time-to-market,  manufacturers  must  be  capable  of  temporarily  scaling  up production. Labour laws in other countries allow manufacturers to average working hour limits across weeks and sometimes months. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) also  recommends  allowing  manufacturers  the  freedom  to  average  working  hour  limits across 3 weeks. 83  However, India's working hour limits may increase the cost, time, and risk of manufacturing.

## Restrictions on overtime for factory workers

Section 65(3)(iv) of the Factories Act (1948) states, ' No worker shall be allowed to work overtime for more than seven consecutive days, and the total number of overtime hours in any quarter shall not exceed seventy-five .' This law limits the number of overtime hours

workers can perform and the overtime wages they can earn. While states may set their own limits,  these  are  generally  lower  than  those  established  by  other  countries.  The  earning potential of workers across countries can be assessed based on the restrictions on overtime hours. 84

Notes:

- a.  Overtime earnings = hourly wage rate * overtime premium * number of overtime hours allowed.
- i. Hourly wage rate = average daily wage rate (₹ 657.61) / 8 (the length of a day's shift in India)
- ii.  Overtime premium = mandated minimum premium under the country's laws.
- iii.  Average daily wage rate = Yearly wages paid per Indian manufacturing worker (as given in Annual Survey of Industries 2022-23) 95   / Maximum number of working days in a year = 2,05,175/312 = 657.61. This wage has been applied to all countries for the calculation.
- iv.  Number of working days in a year = Number of months * Number of working days in a month = 12 * 26 = 312).

- b.    The earnings data assumes that the worker can access the whole number of overtime hours allowed under the law. In practice, a higher overtime rate reduces the likelihood of workers accessing their desired number of overtime hours. Workers can earn more overtime income if higher limits are coupled with a lower overtime rate.
- c. Viet Nam's annual limit is lower than the sum of four quarterly limits. The quarterly limit is used here for calculation.
- d.    This minimum overtime wage rate only applies from the second overtime hour of a workday. The first overtime hour in a workday may be compensated at 150 per cent or more of the regular wage.
- e. The law does not impose any specific limits on overtime. The overtime limit has been derived from other daily-hour restrictions and spread over.
- f. The law does not mandate a minimum overtime premium. To calculate overtime earnings, the ILOrecommended premium of 1.25 is used.
- g.    The law does not impose any specific limits on overtime hours. The law does not set other limits from which overtime limits may be derived. Therefore, an overtime limit of 325 (the highest across countries) has been assumed.

Working hour restrictions are introduced to protect workers' health and prevent overwork. However,  the  various  limits  on  working  hours-per  day,  week,  quarter,  and  year-often conflict,  reducing  workers'  earning  potential.  For  instance,  Section  56  of  the  Factories Act limits a worker to a maximum of ten and a half hours at a factory daily, equating to approximately 63 hours in a six-day week. Of these, only 48 hours are considered regular (Section 51), three hours are considered rest intervals, and the remaining 12 hours count as overtime. Over a 13-week quarter, this would allow for 156 overtime hours; yet another provision (Section 65) caps overtime at only 75 hours per quarter. As a result, these laws inadvertently hinder workers' earning potential, ultimately affecting their financial wellbeing, as depicted in the table above. Notably, under the new Labour Laws, seven states viz. Maharashtra, Haryana, HP, Odisha, Punjab, Karnataka and UP have increased the ceiling of overtime hours from 75 up to 144 hours in any quarter.

In  general,  these  compliance  requirements  are  extensive  and  elaborate,  demanding considerable  management  bandwidth,  which  is  a  scarce  resource  in  small  enterprises. However, the new Labour Laws represent a step in the right direction. With the introduction of flexible regulations and their effective implementation, these laws could lead to growth for firms, creating more employment opportunities. They also safeguard labour rights and allow workers to increase their earnings.

12.47.   The Code on Social Security, 2020, is one of the four Labour Codes enacted by the Parliament. The Code provides for the framing of suitable social security measures for gig workers and platform workers on matters relating to life and disability cover, accident insurance, health and maternity benefits, old age protection, etc. The Code also provides for setting up a Social Security Fund to finance the welfare scheme. 96

12.48. To create a universal social security system for all Indians, especially the poor and the underprivileged, the government launched two social security schemes viz., the Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY) and the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) on a pan-India basis in May 2015. The Schemes are being

offered by public sector insurers and other insurers who offer the product on similar terms, with necessary approvals and ties with banks and post offices. As of 27 November 2024,  47.76  crore  and  21.75  crore  persons  have  been  enrolled  cumulatively  under PMSBY and PMJJBY, respectively. Further, 1,48,023 and 8,64,094 claims have been paid under PMSBY and PMJJBY, respectively. 97  Through the eShram portal, workers in the unorganised sector can easily access social security schemes and receive benefits.

## Driving employment opportunities through the digital economy

12.49. OECD defines digital economy as ' all  economic  activity  reliant  on,  or  significantly enhanced by the use of digital inputs, including digital technologies, infrastructure, digital  services,  and  data.  It  refers  to  all  producers  and  consumers,  including  the government, utilising these digital inputs in economic activities '. 98 According to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), India's digital economy is projected to surpass USD one trillion by 2025. 99

12.50. The digital economy has significantly broadened job opportunities, encompassing roles from delivery personnel, cab drivers, and beauty professionals to software engineers and data analysts. Hyperlocal service platforms have revolutionised the job landscape in  the  transportation,  food  delivery,  and  home  services  industries.  These  platforms have created flexible employment options by leveraging technology while transforming traditional service sectors into digitally driven ecosystems.  According to NITI Aayog, the gig workforce is projected to reach 23.5 crore by 2029-30, comprising 6.7 per cent of the non-agricultural workforce and 4.1 per cent of total livelihoods, reshaping the labour  market.  India's  gig  economy  is  proliferating,  fuelled  by  platformisation  and remote work. 100

12.51.  Digital  technologies  have  a  dual  effect  on  employment.  As  Acemoglu  and Restrepo (2019) note, automation replaces human labour through a displacement effect but also boosts demand for new roles through a reinstatement effect in both automated and complementary sectors. 101  This technological reinstatement effect has the potential to drive labour demand and create numerous new job positions, positively impacting employment.

12.52.  The digital economy offers a unique opportunity to bridge the gender gap and positively  impact  the  gender  structure  of  employment.  Women  often  face  distinct challenges  in  the  labour  market  compared  to  men,  including  unequal  access  to education,  limited  job  opportunities,  cultural  bias,  mobility  and  time  restrictions, and concerns about workplace safety. Such barriers frequently exclude women from participating  in  traditional  labour  markets,  particularly  in  developing  economies. The development of the digital economy can positively impact the gender structure of employment. The key benefit of the digital economy is that it allows and encourages remote working, where gender may not matter as much as in the physical economy. It  opens  opportunities  for  women  in  developing  countries  with  increased  financial independence and empowerment. 102

12.53.  A study based on fintech data for 114 economies worldwide by Loko and Yang (2022)  states  that  fintech  adoption  significantly  improves  female  employment  and reduces  gender  inequality. 103 Also,  it  mitigates  the  financial  constraints  of  femaleheaded firms. Similar findings are reported by Sioson and Kim (2019), who note that fintech may play a role in bridging the gender gap in financial inclusion and promoting financial independence. 104  These findings highlight the role that fintech advancements and the digital economy play in creating an enabling environment for women, promoting economic participation and reducing systemic barriers to access to finance.

12.54.  The digital economy holds immense potential to increase employment, but the extent of this impact varies across different industries. To ensure the long-term benefits of  digitalisation  on  employment,  it  is  crucial  to  have  the  right  policies  to  address potential negative impacts on labour share due to automation and digital integration. The special essay on Artificial Intelligence (AI) (chapter 13) discusses the labour market implications of advances in the field of AI.

12.57.  In  addition  to  creating  livelihood  opportunities,  the  renewable  energy  sector provides an opportunity for job creation for women, enhancing their participation in the labour market. The Solar Urja Lamps project in Dungarpur, Rajasthan, is a notable example  of  how  the  renewable  sector  provides  a  unique  opportunity  for  women's empowerment. The project  was  initiated  to  provide  an  economical  and  sustainable solar  lighting  solution.  Women's  self-help  group  (SHG)  members  were  trained  and mentored to become solar entrepreneurs. The project resulted in the employment of 83 women, the establishment of five solar shops, and the assembly, sale, and maintenance of 40,000 solar lamps. 106 The tribal women engaged in the project could earn ₹ 5,0006,000 per month.

12.58. Another example is the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet (GEAPP) interventions. GEAPP India works closely with the DAY-NRLM to design and develop programmes to provide reliable clean energy access leading to improved livelihood for women enterprises. GEAPP India, in collaboration with the rural livelihood mission of UP, has rolled out a programme targeting solarising 50,000 women enterprises in 2025. The objective is to bring one lakh women enterprises under this programme by 2027 and five lakh by 2030. 107

12.59.  Climate  change  and  frequent  disasters  disproportionately  impact  women, especially  those  in  rural  and  low-income  households,  threatening  their  livelihoods. As  climate  risks  grow,  there  is  an  increasing  thrust  for  SHGs  to  enable  alternative livelihoods, creating opportunities for women in agriculture, home-based work, and MSMEs. Achieving this  requires  an  ecosystem  with  access  to  tailored  technologies, reliable energy, financial support, and business development services.

12.60. Technological,  financial,  and  social  challenges  exist  for  women  engaging  in alternative livelihoods. Gender-biased tools, limited financing, and socio-cultural and geographic barriers constrain women's productivity and economic participation. Poorly designed, energy-inefficient tools force manual labour, while high costs and complex credit processes hinder technology adoption. Remote and hilly areas face additional challenges, including limited mobility, market access, and energy reliability.

12.61.  Climate-smart  solutions  that  use  Decentralised  Renewable  Energy  (DRE) (primarily solar energy) to power efficient appliances present a promising option to begin addressing these challenges in women-led livelihoods. There is substantial scope for  these  DRE-enabled  livelihood  solutions  in  agriculture,  agro-processing,  dairy, poultry, fisheries, textiles, crafts, and micro-enterprises.

12.62. The SELCO Foundation 108  demonstrates how DRE solutions can boost women's entrepreneurship and economic participation. It has empowered over 6,200 women in farming, food processing, textiles, and digital services across 24 states through energyefficient  technologies,  affordable  financing,  training,  market  linkages,  and  climateresilient infrastructure. Two such examples are discussed. Hundreds of women farmers in North Karnataka are advancing millet cultivation and local consumption through a solar-powered processing unit, boosting incomes and confidence for farmers, SHGs, and  Farmer  Producer  Organisations  (FPOs).  Similarly,  the Boipariguda-Sabujima FPO under Odisha's Millet Mission has adopted solar-powered processing, enhancing value capture, reducing costs, and fostering a productive, energy-reliable ecosystem.

12.63. The DRE solutions have the potential to improve well-being, cut energy costs, and strengthen local skills and financial inclusion while mitigating CO 2 emissions. With the right policies and strategies, the DRE solutions may be leveraged to address women entrepreneurs' challenges and support women-led livelihood.
