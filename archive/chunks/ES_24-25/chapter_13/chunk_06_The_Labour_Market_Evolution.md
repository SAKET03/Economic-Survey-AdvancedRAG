# The Labour Market Evolution

THE LABOUR MARKET EVOLUTION

13.47  Labour and Technology, when integrated in the right way, have complemented one another rather than being substitutes. Further, technical change did not always lead to declining employment in the affected industry; rather, it has resulted in strong employment growth during the decades the technology was being refined. For instance, Bessen (2018) 45  investigated the impact automated manufacturing had on the textiles, steel, and automotive industries of the United States. The findings demonstrated that productivity gains due to automation led to robust job growth and higher earnings for workers over the course of nearly four decades before plateauing.

13.48  Studies assessing the introduction of robots in factories corroborate the same. While the employment share in routine manual jobs declined due to the adoption of automated robots on the factory floor, this in no way led to capital substituting for labour  in  the  advanced  economies 46 .  Such  effects  were  also  visible  in  developing countries,  where  robots  in  fact  reduced  unemployment  growth  as  robotic  work  and human work integrated with one another over time 47 . Specifically in the case of India, a study by Mani (2018) illustrated how the introduction of robots only accounted for the replacement of only 10 jobs per 10000 in the manufacturing sector by 2016 48 . This was primarily concentrated in automobiles, while the rest of the manufacturing sector remained largely unaffected by automation.

13.49  Similarly,  Albanesi  et  al.  (2024)  introduced  some  much-needed  balance  to the  literature  on  the  effects  of  AI/ML  led  automation  on  white-collar  jobs 49 .  Their assessment of the impact of AI/ML on white-collar jobs in Europe suggests that there exists a positive association between AI-enabled automation as the sector-occupation employment share of high-skilled workers increases in the range of 3.1 per cent to 6.6 per cent over the course of a decade.

13.50  Research  has  already  demonstrated  how  the  introduction  of  generative  AI assistants augmenting customer support personnel increased productivity by 14 per cent on average, including a 34 per cent improvement for new and lower-skilled workers 50 . Employees  were  able  to  substantially  improve  their  problem  resolution,  leading  to higher customer satisfaction. Cogito, a customer support firm, has been encouraging the use of AI assistants, which are able to analyse customer sentiments and provide real-time  feedback  to  customer  support  representatives,  improving  the  efficiency  of issue resolution. Implementing AI as a tool helps bridge the skill gap in this domain, allowing low-skilled workers to produce outputs closer in quality to the work highskilled workers do without any tools. The reduction in skill inequality is a big positive on aggregate since the overall productivity increases.

13.51 In more complex fields such as scientific research, Human-AI teams are able to  generate  high-quality  outputs  by  capitalising  on  the  best  of  human  and  machine intelligence. For instance, Charness et al. (2023) find that AI-assisted research design benefits in five core aspects: Questions and Literature, generating testable hypotheses and  methodologies  for  testing,  instructions  and  comprehension  checks,  generating experimental code and related documentation, and auditing for errors 51 . Prof. Noshir Contractor of Northwestern University also cites several other instances in his research where AI-enabled researchers benefitted from the capacity of the machine for processing vast  amounts of scientific  data  for  hypothesis  generation,  enhanced  data  collection, manuscript review, and meta-analysis, among others 52 .

13.52  Supplementing human decision-making with AI assistants would be the ideal and the most desirable outcome for maximising the micro- and macroeconomic benefits of the technology. This is what the leading AI firms seek to achieve as well. In his most recent blog, Sam Altman (the co-founder of OpenAI) stated that their intentions are to put 'great tools in the hands of people', with the goal of achieving broadly distributed outcomes 53 .  Similarly,  in  Alphabet  Inc.'s  2024  Q3  earnings  call,  the  CEO  of  Google stated that the company internally is using AI to augment their engineers' productivity by automating low level tasks, which allows their people to focus on more complex tasks 54 .

13.53  Further,  factors  such  as  accountability,  an  understanding  of  the  subjective and  practical  realities  of  the  world,  consistently  adapting  reasoning,  cognisance  of

consequences,  and  critical  thinking  are  all  important  factors  which  human  capital brings  to  any  enterprise.  Replacing  authentic,  intelligent  deliberation  with  a  brutal, calculative algorithm will result in a society where algorithms serve as an escape from reason, an excuse not to think. AI must be seen for and utilised as what it is supposed to be, a tool, as the arc of technological history does not bend towards the replacement of humans by machines.

## AUGMENTING INDIA'S SERVICES SECTOR

13.54  India  is  a  services-driven  economy,  and  the  opportunities  for  enhancing  the productivity of the workforce are ample. Further, the younger population of the country makes a rich talent pool available for capitalising on emerging technologies. This is significant  because  the  study  by  Albanesi  et  al.  (2024)  analysing  the  effects  of  AI/ ML implementation in Europe revealed that youth and high-skilled workers were the demographic most capable of understanding and adapting to technological changes 55 .

13.55 Education and skilling are going to play a critical role in driving the success of human-centric AI adoption in the country while minimising labour displacement as best we can. If history has taught us anything, it is that with each subsequent technological revolution, the floor for what is considered a basic skill has risen. As automation handles the routine and mundane tasks, the mind is now free to focus on more complex questions and  issues,  thus  raising  skill  requirements.  The  Industrial  Revolution  demanded  a labour force skilled in handling factory machines and engineers who maintained them. The Age of Steam and Railways shifted the employment landscape towards industrial and urban jobs, primarily in construction, operations and maintenance. The Age of Steel, Electricity and Heavy Engineering demanded a workforce capable of handling large-scale machinery, electrical equipment and several other jobs in the technical fields. With the Information and Telecommunications era, jobs shifted towards knowledgebased and service-oriented jobs.

13.56  As  developments  in  the  field  of  AI  create  tools  capable  of  automating  basic knowledge creation and processing, skills such as critical thinking, higher degrees of creativity, and the capacity for more specialised knowledge may well be the new normal. Thus, India's employment challenge is not just about numbers but also about raising the overall 'quality' of the workforce. Quality in this case does not just mean imparting knowledge through a step-by-step guide to leveraging AI, or providing very specific training related to 'AI oriented jobs.' Technology specific skills run the risk of becoming obsolete very soon, especially in today's world where the requirements shift rapidly.

13.57 In addition to the above, improvements in the quality of the workforce must focus on more foundational skills as well, such as soft skills and core competencies which are valuable across industries and roles. Foundational skills support the learning of tech-specific skills by fostering adaptability and cognitive agility and are significantly more resistant to the risk of becoming obsolete. The silver lining is that due to the R&amp;D nature of AI, India, this time, has the opportunity to catch up with, if not get ahead of the curve and prepare its workforce.

13.58  Furthermore,  Bessen  (2018) 56   finds  that  technological  change  is  only  labour displacing and brings about mass unemployment if the demand for the product/service offered by the industry is saturated. If the market has large, unmet needs, then labour augmented by machines increases productivity and employment. This implies that new technology should increase employment if the demand elasticity for the sector is high.

## Box XIII.2: Connecting the dots - Employment, automation and demand-elasticities

What happens to work in the presence of automation? Often automation does away with sub-tasks  within  a  job,  in  turn  leading  to  a  modification  of  the  job  profile  than  the  job being  suppressed  entirely  (ILO,2019) 57 .  The  role  of  a  bank-teller  over  time  exemplifies how automation leads to new sub-tasks being taken up alongside other routine, so far unautomated work. For instance, the introduction of labour-saving innovations such as the ATM did not lead to a loss of bank employment. Rather bank employment has grown, and the role of the bank teller has shifted from clerical work to sales and counselling over time (Bessen, 2015) 58 .

Ultimately, the capacity of a sector to create jobs in response to automation depends on whether  the  new  grouping  of  sub-tasks  into  specific  job  profiles  is  deemed  profitable (ILO,2019).  This  is  in  turn  a  function  of  the  demand  for  particular  services  delivered than the supply of skills to fill these jobs (Acemoglu and Autor, 2011 59 ; Bessen, 2018 60 ). Understanding the nature of demand for a particular sector can therefore reveal clues as to how the sector will respond to technological change.

To gauge the employment impact of a technological revolution, it makes sense to look at how employment in the past responded to the industrial revolution of the early 20th century.

Gleaning insights from the days of the industrial revolution, Bessen (2018) 61  looks at data since the 1930s for the US cotton, steel, motor vehicle and textile industries. He finds that technological change is only labour displacing and brings about mass unemployment if the demand for the product/service offered by the industry is saturated. If the market has large, unmet needs, then labour augmented by machines increases productivity and employment. This implies that new technology should increase employment if the demand elasticity for the sector is high.

While some level of worker displacement is inevitable for those unable to align with shifting skill  requirements,  the  scale  of  this  displacement  is  shaped  by  the  interplay  between displacement effects and productivity gains. For instance, in highly demand-elastic markets, the "reinstatement effect" has historically acted as a counterbalance against the displacement effect caused by automation. Technological advancements in markets with unmet demand often give rise to auxiliary tasks where labour maintains a competitive edge. As Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019) 62  observe, such tasks not only enhance productivity but also reinstate labor into a broader spectrum of roles, thereby altering the task composition of production in labor's favor.

## Elasticities for India's services sectors - An estimation

As established in the section before, demand elasticities can help gauge a sector's ability to raise employment because of productivity enhancements from automation. As shown by Bessen (2018), the per capita real demand for a sector (D) can be written as a function of real wages (w) and real prices (p). This is shown by equation (1)

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

This can also be re-written 63 as,

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Where A denotes labour productivity and s is the labour share of income

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Further the elasticity of demand with respect to labour productivity can then be interpreted as:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

On the right-hand side, ϵ D is the price elasticity of demand while the partial derivate shows the  influence  of  productivity  on  labour's  share  of  output.  The  equation  shows  that  price elasticity of demand and productivity elasticity of demand are positively correlated.

63  Since share of income can be re-written as s = = wL w

To understand the potential for employment increases in India's services sector, Bessen (2019)'s theoretical model is replicated with the help of data from RBI's KLEMS database. The data studied is for the period of 1994 to 2023. The demand elasticities estimated for India's services sectors (based on the classification provided by RBI KLEMS) 64  are shown by chart XIII.1. Note that elasticities for transport services and hotel services were insignificant at the 10 per cent level and are hence not depicted in the chart.

As the estimates show, the financial sector shows the highest elasticity at 1.86 followed by Health  and  social  work  (1.3),  Retail  and  wholesale  trade  (1.2),  Business  services  (1.08), Education (0.77) and post and telecom (0.32). It must be noted that the elasticity estimation is at a broad level which does not consider aspects such as product quality. Further, since the classification is sufficiently broad (i.e, industries instead of sectors), it may well be that sub-sectors within the industry show higher or lower elasticities than the industry average.

## Implication for the services sector in India

A sectoral comparison of estimates reveals that demand elasticities are high for sectors such as financial services, trade services, health and social work and business services.

The high elasticity in financial services could be indicative that the sector is yet to reach a stage of market saturation. Productivity enhancement may therefore prove employment generating for the financial sector. Research also corroborates that information technology improvements tend to raise employment in finance, retail and wholesale industries 65 .

High  elasticities  in  the  health  and  social  work  industry  shows  that  automation  can  aid productivity and employment gains in this sector. For instance, as research by Shwalbe and

Wahl, 2020 66   shows,  AI  can  aid  productivity  through  interventions  in  diagnosis,  patient mortality risk assessment, disease outbreak prediction and health policy and planning. In the social work industry, AI can maximise the effectiveness of frontline workers.

The  high  elasticity  in  retail  and  wholesale  trade  in  the  country  is  indicative  of  a  large consumption  base  in  the  country.  Thus,  effective  productivity  gains  are  likely  to  make it  profitable  for  new  roles  to  co-exist  with  automated  tasks  on  average  for  this  industry. Productivity gains for businesses engaged in retail and wholesale activities include identifying customer  preferences,  enhanced  marketing  techniques  and  inventory  management  and forecasting.

The business sector is a export-oriented sector with activities such as IT and IT enabled services, R&amp;D services in the areas such as accounting and legal professions. The sector's elastic demand shows that, on average, services employment may rise in the presence of AI for this particular sector. However, it should be noted that the elasticity estimate does not give a picture of sub-sector elasticities. It is possible then for employment in lower valueadded sub-sectors in the industry (such as Business Process Outsourcing Units) to respond negatively to automation as compared to higher value-added sub-sectors (such as Global Capability Centers).

The education sector shows an inelastic demand for services. Theoretically, this may imply that productivity enhancements through AI-based learning models can lead to a decline in teacher employment. For instance, there maybe a reduction in the need for personnel as a result of cost-effective access to high quality interactive learning media, and customised learning paths for students. However, the essential nature of the service and its high degree of regulation are likely to act as buffers which will ensure that productivity improvements will not come at the expense of teacher employment.

Interestingly, post and telecom also show low elasticity. This sector in particular has reached a  high  degree  of  market  saturation  over  the  past  three  decades.  The  oligopolistic  nature of the industry may also imply that increases in labour productivity may come with lower costs which would translate to higher profit margins (and not necessarily lower prices). A high degree of market saturation and oligopolist market structure imply that prices may not reflect declining costs. Automation may therefore behave as a labour-displacing force than a labour augmenting one.

13.59  While initial displacement is to be expected for workers who fail to catch up to the market demands, the magnitude of displacement also depends on how displacement and productivity effects weigh against each other 67 . For a sufficiently demand-elastic market,  the  displacement  effects  historically  have  been  counterbalanced  by  the 'reinstatement effect'. Demand for new products and services due to new technology in a market with unmet demand has created new, auxiliary tasks where labour has a

competitive advantage. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2019) state that, 'such new tasks not only generate a positive productivity effect, but also a reinstatement effect - reinstating labour into a broader range of tasks and thus change the task content of production in favour of labour. This increases labour demand and labour share.'

13.60  Looking  at  the  history  of  the  labour  market  through  this  lens,  we  can  now decode why, despite major new technologies that automated economic value addition, the employment-to-population ratio rose over the 20th century 68 . Along these lines, the  future  of  work  is  'Augmented  Intelligence',  one  that  expands  the  workforce  to accommodate both humans and machines, with the aim of improving humanity while also bringing about a greater level of efficiency in how we perform our jobs 69 .

13.61 What new opportunities will emerge from the spillover effects of AI will only be clear once AI goes from experimental to practical, but reinforcing the point made earlier, it is up to policymakers, academia, and the private sector to work together to raise the overall quality of human capital in India. This tripartite compact is also going to be instrumental in ensuring that the gains from productivity are distributed widely creating  a  social  surplus,  rather  than  concentrating  in  the  hands  of  an  increasingly oligopolistic sector 70 .
