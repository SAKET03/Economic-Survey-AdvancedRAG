# Global Trade Dynamics

global trade dynamics, marked by gradual shifts towards greater protectionism,  require  assessing  the  situation  and  developing  a  forwardlooking strategic trade roadmap. By adapting to these trends and leveraging its strengths, India can accelerate its growth and enhance its presence in global trade. To strengthen its competitiveness and further integrate into global supply chains, the country can focus on reducing trade-related costs and enhancing export  facilitation  to  create  a  more  vibrant  export  sector.  This  proactive approach will help India continue to thrive in an ever-changing global market.

On  the  capital  front,  foreign  portfolio  investments  (FPIs)  have  shown  a mixed  trend  in  FY25  so  far.  Uncertainty  in  the  global  markets  and  profittaking by foreign portfolio investors led to capital outflows. However, strong macroeconomic fundamentals, a  favourable  business  environment,  and  high economic  growth  have  kept  FPI  flows  positive  overall.  Gross  foreign  direct investment (FDI) inflows have shown signs of revival in the first eight months of FY25, though net FDI inflows declined relative to April-November 2023 due to a rise in repatriation/disinvestment.

India's foreign exchange reserves stood at USD 640.3 billion as of the end of December 2024, sufficient to cover approximately 90 per cent of the country's external  debt  of  USD  711.8  billion  as  of  September  2024,  reflecting  a  strong buffer against external vulnerabilities.
