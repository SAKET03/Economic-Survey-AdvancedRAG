INTRODUCTION

3.1 The world is experiencing increasing political and economic uncertainty in the wake of geopolitical  conflicts,  increasing  trends  of  geoeconomic  fragmentation,  and recurrent climate events. The Great Election year of 2024, during which more than half of the world's population was exercising their franchise to elect their new governments, meant further declining policy predictability. Such political and economic uncertainty can be detrimental to growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates that a one standard deviation increase in uncertainty correlates with a 0.4 to 1.3 percentage point  decrease  in  output  growth. 1 Economists  like  Keynes  and  Tobin  have  pointed out that higher uncertainty requires investors to seek more significant compensation for  risks,  thereby  raising  risk  premia  and  the  overall  cost  of  finance.  Additionally, uncertainty  increases  the  likelihood  of  borrower  defaults,  leading  to  higher  capital costs. Moreover, uncertainty shocks in advanced economies like the US have often led to lower output and reduced prices. 2

3.2 Various indicators are used to monitor global risks and uncertainties and measure policy-related  uncertainty's  impact  on  global  economic  activity.  These  include  the Geopolitical  Risk  (GPR)  index 3 ,  which  tracks  adverse  geopolitical  events  through newspaper  articles;  the  Trade  Policy  Uncertainty  (TPU)  index 4 ,  which  covers  the frequency of articles mentioning trade policy uncertainty and heightened trade tensions, and the Global Economic Policy Uncertainty (GEPU) index 5 , which is a GDP-weighted average of national Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) indices for 21 countries. These indices capture changes occurring in economies constituting about 71 per cent of global output. 6

3.3 These indices provide valuable insights into how uncertainty from trade issues, geopolitical  events,  and  economic  policy  measures  can  impact  global  economic conditions. As of November 2024, the GEPU index remains high, reflecting ongoing global economic policy concerns. Similarly, the TPU index has risen since December 2023, primarily driven by trade tensions and policy changes among major economies.

3.4 The  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)  has  developed  a  policy  uncertainty  index specifically  for  India,  utilising  various  global  indices.  This  index  leverages  internet search  data  from  Google  Trends  to  assess  policy  uncertainty  from  domestic  and international events. Furthermore, the index is updated in real-time. 7,8

3.5 With  this  backdrop,  the  chapter  presents  the  performance  of  India's  external sector  amidst  the  prevailing  global  environment.  Section  I  provides  an  overview  of the global trade dynamics, emphasising tariffs and non-tariff measures (NTMs) and the performance of the global external sector amidst challenges. Section II delves into India's trade performance, highlighting the trends across both the merchandise and services sectors. It examines the performance of India's textile exports and the factors restricting its global expansion. Further, a detailed analysis of India's diversification in exports to new markets has been presented. The key drivers and challenges affecting India's e-commerce export growth are also discussed in depth. Section III discusses the factors restricting export growth and outlines the government initiatives to simplify export procedures to enhance trade performance. Section IV presents India's Balance of Payments (BoP) situation, highlighting current and capital account trends, foreign exchange reserves, exchange rate movements, and India's external debt position. The last section concludes the chapter with an
