7   When faced with heightened uncertainty, it is typical of economic agents to 'search' for more information. The Google Trends-based uncertainty index (India-GUI) leverages this behaviour to measure overall uncertainty by using internet search volumes for a list of keywords about fiscal, monetary and trade policy in India. The policyrelated keywords are curated, based on mentions in central bank policy statements as well as coverage in the financial press.

## GLOBAL TRADE DYNAMICS

3.6 Disruptions in the Red Sea that began in November 2023 have forced changes in trade routes, causing higher shipping costs and longer delivery times. 9 This is particularly true for trade between Asia and Europe, as 40 per cent of this trade passes through the Red Sea region. 10  Similar conflicts in the Hormuz Strait, which channels 21 per cent of global petroleum liquid consumption, have disrupted energy trade and increased prices. Additionally, climate change is enhancing the uncertainties. 11  For instance, the recent drought in the Panama Canal jeopardised international trade, affecting approximately 5 per cent of global maritime trade volumes that transit through it. These conditions are creating uncertainty, leading to a slowdown in international trade, 12  reshaping the contours of trade in terms of a rise in protectionist trade policies and shifting global supply chains.

- 3.7 As evident from Chart III.2, there has been a noticeable rise in the political proximity of trade since late 2022. This indicates a preference for bilateral trade between countries with similar geopolitical stances, i.e., friend-shoring 13 and nearshoring. 14  Concurrently, there has been an increasing concentration of global trade 15  to favour significant trade relationships. For instance, Russia and China's trade dependence on the EU and the US's dependence on China has declined in recent years. In contrast, the dependence of Russia and Vietnam on China has increased. 16,17
- 3.8 Government interventions, including NTMs, reinforce the change in bilateral trade patterns due to geopolitical considerations. The rise in NTMs, which began after the COVID-19 pandemic, was further fuelled by the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. A report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) 18 indicates that technical NTMs impact over 30 per cent of products and nearly 70 per cent of global trade. This is discussed further in paras 3.15 to 3.20 of this chapter.

## Global trade performance in 2024

3.9 According to the latest trade update by UNCTAD 19 , the gradual increase in global trade that began in H2 of 2023 has persisted into 2024. The World Trade Organisation (WTO) database shows a year-on-year (YoY) growth of 3.5 per cent and 3 per cent, respectively, in global merchandise export and import indices in Q3 of 2024 (seasonally adjusted, 2005 Q1=100). Further, the global services exports and imports grew by 7.9 per cent and 6.7 per cent (YoY) during the same period.

3.10 Over the last four quarters, trade growth in developing countries generally exceeded that  of  developed  nations.  However,  this  trend  reversed  in  Q3  of  2024,  with  positive developments in developed economies driving trade growth. In contrast, trade growth in East Asia stalled, and several major Asian developing economies experienced negative growth.

3.11  According  to  the  UNCTAD  nowcast 20 ,  the  positive  momentum  in  global  trade witnessed in the first three quarters of 2024 is expected to continue into Q4. As a result, global trade is set to exceed its 2022 record, reaching nearly USD 33 trillion in 2024. This record high is likely to be driven by a 7 per cent increase in services trade (YoY), while goods trade is projected to grow by about 2 per cent in 2024 but remain below its 2022 peak. Overall, global trade is expected to expand by about USD 1 trillion (or 3.3 per cent) in 2024, with goods and services contributing approximately USD 500 billion each.

## Tariff policies

3.12 To promote free trade, encourage investment, and lower trading costs, countries worldwide have established various trade agreements. The number of regional trade agreements (RTAs) in effect has grown substantially, increasing from 22 in 1990 to 369 as of August 2024. 21  Increased emphasis on free trade and enhanced collaboration in international trade policies under the WTO has reduced border tariffs among nations. For instance, between 2000 and 2024, the average tariff rates on dutiable items in India  decreased  from  48.9  per  cent  to  17.3  per  cent,  while  in  China,  they  fell  from 16.4 per cent to 8.3 per cent. 22   Commodity-wise, between 2012 and 2022, the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) and preferential tariffs declined in agriculture, manufacturing, and natural resources. Globally, the simple average MFN and preferential tariffs for agriculture dropped by approximately 3 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively, between 2012 and 2022. The simple average preferential tariffs decreased by about 1 per cent in the manufacturing sector.

3.13 At a broader level, India's import tariff policy has evolved over time, balancing domestic policy goals with the need to integrate into the global economy. Tariffs vary by sector, with considerations like protecting sensitive sectors from foreign competition and permitting access to important raw materials and intermediate goods. India has ensured that tariff policies comply with WTO rules and regulations. Over time, several efforts have been made to rationalise tariffs further and address the inverted duty structures.

3.14 Tariffs  are  often  perceived  to  have  an  impact  on  competitiveness.  However,  if used in a calibrated way, tariffs can aid the goals of industrial policy and help in the development of desirable sectors in the economy (Box III.1).

## Box III.1: Tariffs and successful industrial policy design

Industrial policy refers to measures that target the transformation of an industry in pursuit of a public goal. Tariffs are a standard tool of industrial policy and are often seen as a way to support fledgling industries before they gain traction. However, using tariffs requires a calibrated approach which balances the sector's needs with the costs imposed on the rest of the economy. Tariffs can also be viewed as a lever within a system of tools that can further the goals of industrialisation.

The use of tariffs in industrial policy can be traced back to the Industrial Revolution. Tariffs were commonly used in Western Europe and North America to catch up with the British industrial revolution. As Matthew C. Klein and Michael Pettis note in their book 'Trade wars are class wars',

'Freidrich List, who moved from Germany to America in 1825, wrote that a country such as Germany, which was less developed but 'possesses the mental and material means' to become wealthy, should instead avoid free trade and 'strengthen her own individual powers.' … The United States levied tariffs on manufactured goods of about 45 per cent from 1870 through 1913…American manufacturers were protected from foreigners but competed within the large-and expanding-domestic market.'

This accords with the observations made by Professor Robert C. Allen on the development history  of  Europe  and  North  America 23 .  According  to  him,  North  America  and  Western Continental  Europe  caught  up  with  the  British  industrial  revolution  by  adopting  the following:

-     Internal free market (elimination of internal tariffs)-national single market
-   Stable domestic banking system
-   High external tariff
-   Universal Education
-   Infrastructure.

They did not catch up with Britain practising free trade and open capital markets.

Globally,  modern-day  industrial  policies  use  a  mix  of  policies,  including  tariff-based protection and other levers such as credit grants and export-related subsidies. 24  Illustrative of this fact, tariffs accounted for just 1.3 per cent of all industrial policy interventions between 2010 and 2022. 25

Lessons in successful industrial policy design can be gleaned from the support the Korean government extended to its heavy chemicals industry in the Seventies. Korean industrial policy in the heavy chemicals sector led to significant gains in output, labour productivity and long-term comparative advantage of the industry's exports. Tools such as tariff-based protection and quantitative restrictions were used for a limited period, after which protection

25  Ibid note 24.

tapered in the 1980s. 26  Importantly, in Korea, tariffs were only one element of a composite industrial policy which sought to protect domestic industry and, at the same time, demanded a reciprocal performance obligation on the part of the industry receiving protection.

The  recipe  for  a  successful  industrial  policy  lies  in  the  simultaneous  use  of  carrots  and sticks, with the sticks often being longer than the carrots. Taking a comprehensive look at the industrial policies of Northeast Asia, Joe Studwell wrote in 'How Asia Works' that the region succeeded with its industrial policy because it punished non-performers more than it rewarded performers. As Studwell notes, the emphasis on infant industry protection in Northeast Asian economies went hand in hand with external benchmarking through export performance. There were special privileges for local businesses, but there was accountability for  export  performance.  That  is  how  scale,  productivity,  efficiency  and  rapid  economic growth were achieved. Studwell repeatedly notes that Korean industrial policy punished its non-performers more than helped performers.

To summarise, the growth experiences of the industrialised West and the miracle growth economies of the East suggest that tariffs were indeed a prominent tool used to further industrialisation. However, tariffs were used in a calibrated way, and a whole-of-government approach  was  adopted  in  crafting  tariff  policies.  Finally,  industrial  policy  goals  were achieved not by protection alone but by policies which ensured that the protected industries performed in response to the protection afforded.

## Non-tariff measures

3.15   The decline in tariffs globally, as discussed above, has been accompanied by an increase in the implementation of NTMs 27  across countries. The Global Trade Alert database 28   shows that between 2020 and 2024, over 26,000 new restrictions related to  trade  and  investments  have  been  globally  imposed.  This  is  further  elucidated  in Chapter 5. The Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) affect 31.6 per cent of the product lines, covering 67.1 per cent of the global trade (as of December 2024). This is followed by export-related measures, affecting 19.3 per cent of the product lines and covering 31.2 per cent of the global trade. Sectors most affected by NTMs include agriculture, manufacturing, and natural resources. 29

26    Lane,  N  (2022).  'Manufacturing  revolutions:  industrial  policy  and  industrialization  in  South  Korea',  CSAE Working Paper Series, (https://tinyurl.com/ye2ahh7k).

27    UNCTAD  defines  NTMs  as  policy  measures  that  are  not  ordinary  customs  tariffs  but  can  still  significantly impact  international  trade  in  goods.  These  measures  can  affect  either  the  quantities  traded,  prices,  or  both (Classification  of  NTMs  |  UNCTAD).  NTMs  are  classified  into  import-related  and  export-related  categories based on the above classification. Import-related NTMs are further classified as 'technical' or 'non-technical.' Technical measures comprise sanitary and phytosanitary measures (SPS), technical barriers to trade (TBT), and pre-shipment inspections. Non-technical measures encompass traditional trade policies like quotas, subsidies,

and trade remedies, including those addressing unfair trade practices. In 2006, the UNCTAD established the Group of Eminent Persons on Non-tariff Barriers (NTBs) and the MultiAgency Support Team (MAST) comprising eight international organisations such as the IMF, OECD, UNIDO), UNCTAD, the World Bank and WTO etc. Over the years, MAST has created a coding system as a foundation for  collecting  and  tallying  NTMs.  The  objective  of  the  International  Classification  of  NTMs  (refer:  UNCTAD report on International Classification of Non-Tariff Measures, https://tinyurl.com/mr3mp5uk) was to provide

information and clarification on new and existing measures and to improve their comparability across countries.

The frequency index is defined as the percentage of HS 6-digit lines covered. The coverage ratio is defined as the percentage of trade that is subject to NTMs

3.16   Globally,  NTMs,  such  as  subsidies  and  export-related  measures,  have  risen  in aid of nations' industrial policy goals. 30   Unlike broad-based tariffs, NTMs tend to be granular in their approach. 31 They are often less visible, making them harder to assess. 32

3.17    A  report  by  UNCTAD and the UNESCAP 33  shows evidence of increased use of NTMs by countries  to  adapt  and  mitigate  climate  change.  According  to  the  report, although climate change-related NTMs account for only 2.6 per cent of total measures, they  are  concentrated  in  some  of  the  largest  and  most  CO2-intensive  trade  sectors, such as the automotive industry, electricity and heat generation, transformation, and storage. As a result, 26.4 per cent of global trade, valued at USD 6.5 trillion, is covered by climate-change-related NTMs. TBT comprise over 61 per cent of all identified climate change-related NTMs, followed by export-related and price-control measures (as of December 2024). In the future, the imposition of climate-change-related NTMs by the EU in the form of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) 34  and European

34    CBAM is the EU's tool to put a fair price on the carbon emitted during the production of carbon-intensive goods that are entering the EU and to encourage cleaner industrial production in non-EU countries.

Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) 35  is anticipated to have broad implications for  exporters  in  emerging  economies such as China, India, and Turkey. 36 Box  III.2 discusses CBAM and EUDR and their possible impact on India's exports in detail.

## Box III.2: CBAM and EUDR and their likely impact on India's exports

## Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism

Implemented by the EU and under consideration by the UK, CBAM aims to align the cost of carbon emissions for imported goods with that of domestically produced products. As countries/groups  like  the  EU  phase  out  the  free  allowances  they  offer  their  industries under the Emissions Trading System (ETS), they are ushering in CBAM to prevent their consumption from shifting to countries with relatively softer environmental regulations. Under the mechanism, importers will buy carbon certificates corresponding to the carbon price paid by the domestic producers/manufacturers under the EU's carbon pricing rules. Thus, CBAM is effectively a carbon price equalisation measure.

The key sectors covered under the EU CBAM include iron and steel, aluminium, cement, and fertilisers. Reporting requirements for the EU CBAM began on 1 January 2024, with quarterly submissions for the previous quarter. The levy, however, is expected to take effect from 1 January 2026. The UK has also proposed its own CBAM, scheduled to come into force on 1 January 2027, reflecting a broader global shift towards carbon pricing mechanisms. The key sectors covered under the UK CBAM include cement, fertilisers, glass, ceramics, iron and steel, aluminium, and hydrogen. Currently, the EU CBAM addresses only direct emissions from production processes, whereas the proposed UK CBAM intends to cover both direct and indirect emissions. CBAM aims to equalise carbon prices across geographies, thereby negating the comparative advantage of developing members like India and the least developed countries.

The justification offered for the introduction of CBAM is that it prevents carbon leakage. 37 Some jurisdictions believe that the aggregate impact of the countries' nationally determined contributions, if fully implemented, would not put the world on a pathway to achieving the Paris Agreement goal. Therefore, the logic behind CBAM is that as long as they did not have the same level of ambition, CBAM was necessary to protect the integrity of climate mitigation efforts in Europe and ensure they were not undermined by carbon leakage. Moreover, the

35    The EUDR requires operators and traders to ensure that the products placed in the EU market are (i) deforestationfree (i.e., must not be derived from a land which is deforested after December 31 2020); (ii) should be produced following the relevant legislation of the country where the product is produced; and (iii) covers the submission of a due diligence statement before placing the products in the EU.

proposed ban on steel scrap exports from the EU, a key input for steel production, will significantly hinder developing countries' capacity to produce more carbon-efficient steel. This measure can be perceived as the EU attempting to enjoy the benefits of both sides while also imposing trade restrictions.

## Likely impact on India

The share of CBAM exports in total Indian exports to the EU has increased substantially from 6.3 per cent in 2014 to 10.5 per cent in 2023. 38  Table III.1 presents the commodity-wise exposure of India's exports to the EU, which are likely to be impacted by CBAM.

According  to  the  World  Bank's  Relative  CBAM  Exposure  Index 39 ,  India  has  a  score  of 0.03, reflecting a high exposure to CBAM. 40  Countries like India face the twin challenge of  achieving  higher  levels  of  economic  development  and  dealing  with  climate  change mitigation and adaptation. Therefore, the international community must find a balance that supports both environmental sustainability and the economic development needs of developing economies and LDCs, ensuring that multilateralism remains the cornerstone of global trade relations. 41

## European Union Deforestation Regulation

The EUDR (whose implementation will start at the end of 2025 and in 2026 for smaller businesses) seeks to regulate the consumption of products derived from deforested land. The EUDR places several compliances on the operators and traders of the relevant products

38    'Intermingling  of  Trade  and  Environment  Policy:  Implications  of  EU-CBAM  on  India  and  LDCs',  EPW,  16 November 2024 https://tinyurl.com/yb32jhdp.

39    CBAM exposure index is measured as the mathematical product of two main elements-the share of a country's exports of the CBAM-related product that goes to the EU and the embodied carbon payment per dollar of export to  the  EU,  determined  by  the  carbon  emissions  intensity  of  production  and  the  assumed  cost  of  the  CBAM certificates.CBAM exposure index is measured by multiplying the export share by the embodied carbon payment per dollar of export to the EU (the exporter's emission intensity times $100 per ton carbon price).

covered  under  the  regulation. 42 It  requires  the  operators  and  traders  to  ensure  that  the products placed in the EU market are (i) deforestation-free (i.e., must not be derived from a land which is deforested after December 31 2020); (ii) should be produced by the relevant legislation of the country where the product is produced; and (iii) covers the submission of a due diligence statement, including supply chain integrity through an elaborate trace and track system before placing the products in the EU.

The regulation also entails  devising  a  country-level  benchmarking  system  indicating  the forest degradation and deforestation risk by the EU. The benchmarking system would be based on a three-tier system for classifying countries as low, standard, or high risk, which would be determined based on internationally recognised information and data on whether a  country  is  active  in  reducing  deforestation.  High-risk  countries  would  be  required  to exercise higher due diligence for the relevant products compared to low or standard-risk countries.  This categorisation of countries would be used to identify the checks to be carried out by the EU authorities. High-risk countries would be subject to more rigorous checks than countries categorised as having low-risk. 43

The regulation covers products such as soy, beef, palm oil, wood, cocoa, coffee, rubber, and their derived products, such as leather, chocolate, tyres, or furniture. 44 It puts the onus of proving compliance on the operator or trader who wishes to sell these products in the EU markets. 45 The costs of complying with the regulation include information requirements, risk assessment, risk mitigation and reporting obligations. These costs are not border measures but affect the competitiveness of a country's exports vis-à-vis other countries' compliance costs. Therefore, the Regulation would change the trade costs (increase) for the EU's trading partners in specific commodities.

As per a GTRI study 46 , as far as India's exports are concerned, coffee, leather hide and skin preparations, oil  cake,  paper,  paperboard,  and  wood  furniture  could  be  highly  impacted by the Regulation. It also compares the tariff lines covered under the Regulation vis-à-vis

42    The  Regulation defines an 'operator' as natural or legal person who, in the course of a commercial activity, places relevant products on the market or exports them and a 'trader' as any person in the supply chain other than the operator who, in the course of a commercial activity, makes relevant products available on the market.

43    As  per  the  Regulation  dated  31  May  2023,  'In  respect  of  relevant  products  from  countries  or  parts  thereof classified  as  high  risk,  the  respective  operators  and  traders  and  the  volumes  of  their  share  of  relevant commodities and relevant products, a twofold approach that provides comprehensive coverage should apply. Competent authorities should thus be required to check on a certain percentage of operators and traders, whilst also covering a specific percentage of relevant products. In respect of relevant products from countries or parts thereof classified as low or standard risk, competent authorities should be required to check at least a certain percentage of operators and traders. The level of checks should be higher for relevant products from high-risk countries or parts thereof whereas it could be lower for standard or low-risk countries or parts thereof.'

44    The list of products covered under the Regulation is available at Annex I of the Regulation dated 31 May 2023, available at https://tinyurl.com/bddmuysp.

45    Article 2 (15) of the Regulation states, 'An operator is a natural or legal person who places relevant products on the Union market or exports them from the Union market in the course of commercial activity.'

CBAM, out of which the latter is wider in its coverage. The CBAM and EUDR are expected to affect USD 9.5 billion of India's exports to the EU, which amounts to 9 per cent of India's exports to the world or 12.9 per cent of India's exports to the EU. The study informs that the regulation effectively encourages local production and export of selected agricultural commodities by erecting more barriers against imports in the name of climate.

According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation, around 420 million hectares of forest were lost globally due to deforestation between 1990 and 2020, an area the  size  of  the  EU. 47 In  Europe,  conversion  to  cropland  accounted  for  about  15  per  cent of deforestation during the same time period. 48  European agriculture could not have come up without deforestation, and the imposition of EUDR reeks of double standards. Thus, that  a  region  that  has  resorted  to  significant  deforestation  to  expand  crop  production  is implementing the EUDR to regulate the consumption of products sourced from deforested land, appears quite contradictory, even as it is unsurprising.

In short, it is hard to shake off the conclusion that both CBAM and EUDR are trade protection measures garbed in the language of climate and environment. The game and the end goals are the same, but the tactics keep changing. Labour standards, gender, democracy, emissions and deforestation, the innovative list will keep evolving with time. Institutions and practices evolve  with  development.  Today's  developed  countries  do  not  conform  to  the  standards that  they  expect  from  developing  countries  at  a  similar  stage  of  development.  But  then, intellectual consistency is not really the goal here.

3.18  NTMs are playing an increasing role in international trade due to a decline in the usage of tariffs worldwide via successive agreements under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/WTO and due to growing consumer concerns about food safety, quality, and environmental protection. 49  A UNCTAD report 50  notes that NTMs can serve as legitimate policy instruments, fulfilling important roles such as protecting human health and the environment. In some cases, they may even enhance trade. For instance, when an exporting  country  implements  high  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  standards, consumers in importing countries tend to have greater confidence in the quality of the food products, which can lead to increased demand. Stricter domestic food safety standards can also help local exporters meet the requirements of their trade partners, further boosting trade opportunities.

3.19 Though many NTMs aim primarily to protect public health or the environment, they also adversely impact trade by increasing information, compliance, and procedural costs. This is significant for exporters and importers because accessing and benefiting from markets increasingly depends on adherence to trade regulations, such as sanitary

standards  and  product  quality  requirements.  For  instance,  a  regulation  that  limits pesticide residues in food products seeks to achieve a significant public health goal of protecting human health and nutrition. However, this regulation imposes additional compliance  requirements  on  firms  in  exporting  countries,  and  some  may  find  that exporting  is  no  longer  profitable.  Consequently,  such  regulations  can  restrict  trade, leading to lower incomes in exporting countries and higher prices for consumers in importing  countries.  This  issue  mainly  affects  smaller  exporters  and  low-income countries, as they often bear a disproportionate burden from these NTMs. 51

3.20  NTMs can indirectly affect FDI through their impact on imports. A firm might decide to bypass an NTM by engaging in FDI if the costs associated with this approach are lower than the costs of exporting. Additionally, NTMs can encourage inward FDI to the country that imposes them, as these measures raise barriers to market access. Research has demonstrated that NTMs have a positive impact on FDI. For example, if the average number of NTMs applied to a product increases from 2.5 to 3.5 NTMs per product, FDI could increase by 12 per cent. Certain NTMs, such as intellectual property rights, local content requirements, and TBT in specific sectors, appear to affect FDI significantly. 52

## TREND IN INDIA'S TRADE PERFORMANCE

3.21  India's trade sector has demonstrated remarkable stability and growth, achieving milestones despite global economic headwinds. Following a dip in FY20 amid the global downturn and the pandemic, overall exports rebounded strongly in FY22, reaching a  record  high  in  FY23.  This  momentum  continued  into  FY24,  with  overall  exports surpassing the previous year's record, even as imports moderated slightly.

3.22  India's total exports (merchandise+services) have shown positive momentum in the first nine months of FY25, reaching USD 602.6 billion, witnessing a YoY growth of 6 per cent. This increase demonstrates the resilience of exports, which have been building on a steady upward trend in recent years despite global economic challenges. Total imports during April-December 2024 reached USD 682.2 billion, registering a YoY growth of 6.9 per cent. This positive import growth indicates a steady demand for goods in the Indian market, supporting domestic consumption and production needs. A more significant increase in overall imports compared to exports led to a rise in the overall trade deficit from USD 69.7 billion during April-December 2023 to USD 79.5 billion in the corresponding period of FY25.

3.23  During April-December 2024, non-petroleum exports were  up by 7.1 per cent. Over the same period, non-petroleum and non-gems and jewellery exports rose by 9.1 per cent. Specific sectors like drugs and pharmaceuticals, electronic goods, engineering

goods, and chemicals saw an increase in exports, growing by 6.4 per cent, 28.6 per cent, 9.9 per cent, and 5 per cent, respectively, during April-December 2024 on a YoY basis. Textile exports 53  also saw a YoY increase of 7.6 per cent during the same period. Rising inflationary pressures on cereals, pulses, and edible oils limited the exports of agricultural  and  allied  products.  Overall,  merchandise  exports  registered  a  modest growth  of  1.6  per  cent  (YoY  basis)  primarily  attributed  to  a  decline  in  the  value  of petroleum product exports due to a fall in international commodity prices.

3.24 Merchandise  imports  grew  by  5.2  per  cent  during  April-December  2024.  This increase was largely due to a rise in non-oil, non-gold imports, which reached USD 352.1 billion in the first nine months of FY25 compared to USD 340.5 billion during the same period last year, indicating a rebound in domestic consumption despite the inflationary impact. Gold imports increased due to higher international prices, driven by frontloading ahead of festival spending and demand for safe-haven assets. Among the major non-oil, non-gold imports, non-ferrous metals, machine tools, machinery, electrical  &amp;  non-electrical  goods,  and  transport  equipment  witnessed  remarkable growth  in  the  first  nine  months  of  FY25,  reflecting  growing  demand  for  capital goods.  Electronic  goods  also  maintained  consistent  momentum,  signalling  a  rise  in discretionary consumer spending. Additionally, imports of pulses and cotton rose to support domestic production and control inflation.

3.25   The  faster  pace  of  increase  in  merchandise  imports  compared  to  exports contributed to the widening of the merchandise trade deficit to USD 210.8 billion in April-December 2024, compared to USD 189.7 billion in the same period last year.

53    Textile exports include Cotton Yarn/Fabrics/made-ups, Handloom Products, Man-made Yarn/Fabrics/madeups, etc., RMG of all Textiles, Jute Mfg. including Floor covering, carpet and Handicrafts, excluding handmade carpet.

## Textile exports

3.26 India's textile sector has been a matter of pride and strength to the nation for centuries. From the unique prints and weaves to the rich dyes and handwork, the textile sector weaves various aspects of our cultural, social, and historical heritage. India is the sixth-largest exporter of textiles and apparel globally. The textile and apparel industry contributes 2.3 per cent of GDP, 13 per cent to industrial production, and 12 per cent to exports. 54 It is also one of the largest employment generators after agriculture, with over 45 million people employed directly, including many women and the rural population. 55 As further evidence of the inclusive nature of this industry, nearly 80 per cent of its capacity is spread across Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) clusters in the country. 56

3.27    India  exported  textile  items  worth  USD  34  billion  in  2023,  with  apparel constituting  42  per  cent  of  the  export  basket  (USD  14.6  billion),  followed  by  raw materials/semi-finished materials at 34 per cent (USD 11.7 billion) and finished nonapparel goods at 30 per cent (USD 7.8 billion). 57  Europe and the US consumed nearly 66 per cent of India's apparel exports, 58 per cent of finished non-apparel goods and 12  per  cent  of  raw  materials/semi-finished  materials.  Other  prominent  destinations include the UK (8 per cent of apparel exports) and the UAE (7 per cent).

3.28  Generally, the Indian textile export basket is skewed towards cotton and cottonbased products. In 2023, for example, eight out of the top 10 textile exports (by value) consisted of cotton and cotton-based products. For India's major textile export category,

57  Analysis based on UN COMTRADE data at the tariff level.

i.e.,  apparel,  the  country  enjoyed  a  market  share  of  2.8  per  cent  globally  in  2023. However, this is much lower than that of key players in the industry, such as China (30 per cent), Bangladesh (9 per cent), and Vietnam (7 per cent). Further analysis at the HS-6 levels reveals that while India offers stiff competition to other exporters 58 for nearly USD 3 billion worth of apparel exports, the remaining apparel basket is yet to match our competitors' comparative advantage.

3.29 Textile  exports  remained  resilient  throughout  the  COVID-19  period  between 2020 to 2022, but their performance has been weak over a decadal timeframe. Box III.3 elaborates on potential factors that impede export growth and opportunities that must be tapped for the sector to reach its goal of USD 150 billion in textile exports by 2030. 59

## Box III.3: Time to be deft about our warp and weft!

## Costs that chip away at textile export growth

India's  textile  production  occurs  across  multiple  independent  and  clustered  Small  and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) spread across the country. Take cotton production, for example, which is spread across Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. The fresh produce of cotton then travels down to Tamil Nadu, where cotton yarns are produced. The yarns then travel to parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat before being weaved into cotton fabric. A lack of localisation and the complexity of the value chain, in turn, results in higher costs relative to global competitors. In contrast, vertically integrated 'fibre-to-fashion' firms in competitor nations such as China and Vietnam export low-cost products, maintain consistent quality and are nimble enough to adjust to the fast-changing nature of the industry. Simple and liberal customs procedures further reduce regulatory costs and lend a competitive edge to the exports of global textile competitors such as China and Vietnam.

On the other hand, in India textile exporters are constrained by complex procedures, which, for instance, require exporters to meticulously account for every square centimetre of fabric, buttons and zippers used. Similarly, pre-shipment inspection certificates are required for textile imports, which slows down logistics and raises costs for the textile business. 60

58    Exports at the HS-6 level enjoy a market share that is within the periphery or higher than the market share of China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.

59  PIB press release of Ministry of Textiles dated 18 November 2024, https://tinyurl.com/jhvcuttm

60    GTRI report, July 2024, 'How complex procedures, import restrictions and domestic interests hinder India's garment exports',  https://tinyurl.com/yxjxjzyz.

Apart from possessing structural attributes (such as vertical integration, liberal labour laws, etc.) that allow for cost advantages, competitors in the textile market also have the added benefit of FTAs with consumer countries. In effect, Indian apparel exports do not face a level playing field compared to its competition. For instance, as noted by Mukherjee et al. 2019 61 , even though India has a significant comparative advantage in exporting silk shawls and scarves, the country faces a high tariff rate of 11.3 per cent in the US. In comparison, competitors like Korea face zero tariffs on their silk scarf exports due to trade agreements such as the US-Korea FTA.

In  general,  the  costs  for  the  textile  industry  are  likely  to  rise  over  the  coming  years.  A global  structural  shift  towards  sustainable  sourcing  would  drive  this.  Often,  such  a  shift is  necessitated by regulatory changes. The EU, for instance, has as many as 16 pieces of legislation spanning the entire fashion value chain, which came into force between 2021 and 2024. 62  As the EU accounts for nearly 20 per cent of our exports, such a shift poses a challenge for small enterprises who need to shift to environmentally sustainable production methods.

## Changing trends in the global textile industry

India has a great opportunity to align with the evolving global shifts in apparel demand. While our comparative advantage lies in cotton and cotton-based products, global demand has shifted to products made from man-made fibre (MMF). MMF-based products range from  yoga  pants  and  athleisure  wear  to  technical  textiles  in  aviation,  aerospace,  and automobiles.

As  per  International  Cotton  Association,  MMF  comprised  77  per  cent  of  global  fibre consumption in 2024, whereas it was just 22 per cent for cotton.

By tapping into the MMF value chain, India will benefit from the steady rise in global MMF demand. India's share of global MMF production is currently 9.2 per cent, and the potential to catch up with the production levels of global leaders like Vietnam, China, and Taiwan is high. 63

To match the quality of our competition and reap value gains from MMF production, our MMF sector must move towards vertical integration and significantly invest in research and development and sustainable production techniques.

## Fashioning  India's  textile  exports  to  a  global  audience-recent  schemes  and opportunities ahead

In recent years, the government has announced many policies in response to the changing nature of global demand and high relative costs faced by Indian exporters. A PLI scheme has been put in place for the sector with an outlay of ₹10,683 crore, which rewards capacity

63  As per World Textile Demand Report, 2024; https://tinyurl.com/52m82u5k

creation through investments in the industry. As MMF products require heavy research and development suited to different use cases, the National Technical Textiles Mission (NTTM) has been approved with an outlay of ₹1,480 crore. As of 2024, 168 research projects (worth ₹509 crore) were approved under the NTTM mission. 64

In response to the need for a vertically integrated textile industry, the government-sanctioned Pradhan Mantri Mega Integrated Textile Region and Apparel (PM-MITRA) parks across seven sites in 2022 to create world-class plug-and-play infrastructure and invite FDI into the  textile  sector.  World-class,  standardised  infrastructure  will  also  aid  textile  exporters in  responding  better  to  changing  ESG  requirements  in  the  industry.  To  help  with  cost competitiveness, the Government approved the continuation of the Scheme for Rebate of State and Central Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL) for export of Apparel/Garments and Madeups up to 31 March 2026 in the interim Union Budget FY25 65 . Further, deep FTAs such as the UAE-India CEPA (2022) have helped reduce India's textile tariffs with a significant market. India is actively working towards negotiating trade deals with top importers such as the EU and the UK.

India's  textile  sector  has  several  tailwinds  working  in  its  favour.  For  instance,  as  per McKinsey's  chief  procurement  officer  survey,  the  share  of  procurement  officers  looking to form long-term strategic partnerships (including volume commitments) has more than doubled between 2019 and 2023. 66  Further, more than 40 per cent of procurement officers surveyed plan to increase their sourcing from India, Bangladesh, and Vietnam.

66  McKinsey article, 'Reimagining the apparel value chain amid volatility', https://tinyurl.com/2nhedse4.

While there are tailwinds which will support the growth of India's textile exports, these cannot be fully exploited without lowering the costs of the textile basket and deepening our market share in the MMF sector. These objectives would require the industry to step up its research efforts and vertically integrate and tailor products to international quality and sustainability requirements.

Simplification, consolidation, and elimination of processes that consume the financial and managerial bandwidth of our exporters is a low-hanging fruit. Addressing these challenges can significantly reduce costs and ease the burden on exporters, helping them become more efficient and competitive.

## Diversification of India's exports to new markets

3.30  As discussed in a Collection of Essays of the Department of Economic Affairs 67 , over time, India has added a large number of new products to its export basket. Between 1994 and 2022, India has not just carved out new markets but has become the market leader  in  some  of  the  new  product  categories.  For  instance,  India  is  a  top  exporter of  shipping vessels (with nearly 33 per cent market share). Similarly, it is a leading exporter of iron and steel alloys, an unexplored market before 1994.

3.31  Between April and November 2024, India's exports saw significant growth and expansion into diverse markets despite high global challenges. The analysis depicts the number of diverse markets, consisting of absolutely new markets where no exports were  observed  between  April  and  November  2023,  but  exports  happened  in  the corresponding period of FY25. It also includes new markets where export share was 0-0.1 per cent from April to November 2023 and rose to over 0.1 per cent with growth in value greater than 25 per cent in the corresponding period of FY25. Further, promising markets, where export share was 0.1-1 per cent in April to November 2023 and rose to over 1 per cent with growth in value greater than 25 per cent in April to November 2024. The size of the dot reflects the value of exports. The analysis has been done based on the data available for key Principal Commodities (PCs).

3.32  These 20 PCs were selected based on two criteria: firstly, the PCs were sorted in descending order of the number of new markets explored, and secondly, the PCs had an export value of more than USD 100 million. For instance, Chat III.15 shows that optical items had an export value of USD 16.6 million from April to November 2024 and were exported to 14 new markets (Zimbabwe, Vietnam, Tanzania, Uganda, Tunisia, Romania, Qatar, Philippines, Mozambique, Kuwait, South Korea, Iraq, Ghana, Finland). Similarly, the export of cranes, lifts and winches had a value of USD 23.1 million from April to November 2024, which has been exported to 12 new markets (Taiwan, Somalia, Portugal, Myanmar, Morocco, Madagascar, Lithuania, Jordan, Honduras, Cameroon, Armenia).  Further, office equipment &amp; medical-scientific instruments have an export value of USD 10.7 million (exported to 12 new markets) and USD 62.7 million (exported

to 9 new markets), respectively. Surgicals has also been exported to nine new markets with a total value of USD 5.4 million.

<!-- image -->

3.33 These trends reflect India's ability to maintain and even strengthen its presence in established markets. It also highlights the country's resilience and adaptability in navigating evolving global landscapes. Simultaneously, the exploration of new markets signifies a proactive approach to expanding its export reach and reducing dependency on any single market or region. This diversification strategy mitigates risks associated with market fluctuations and positions India as a more competitive player in the international trade landscape while contributing to the country's economic development.

## Services trade remained resilient amidst global challenges

3.34 Services sector exports have demonstrated resilience, while merchandise exports have witnessed moderation in recent months. They grew at 11.6 per cent in the first nine months of FY25 amidst unfavourable geopolitical conditions. The rise in services exports contributed to an increase in net services receipts from USD 120.1 billion in the first nine months of FY24 to USD 131.3 billion during the corresponding period of FY25.

<!-- image -->

3.35   Services  exports  from  India  have  shown  a  multi-sectoral  presence  in  global exports,  with  notable  contributions  across  several  sectors.  India's  share  in  global services exports has more than doubled, reaching around 4.3 per cent in 2023 from 1.9 per cent in 2005. 68    In 'Telecommunications, Computer, &amp; Information Services', India commands 10.2 per cent of the global exports market (ranking 2nd largest exporter in the world), reflecting its strong position in IT outsourcing, software development, and digital services. The 'Other Business Services sector' also plays a crucial role, with India holding 7.2 per cent of the world share (ranking 3rd largest exporter in the world), driven by its expertise in professional and consulting services. 69

3.36  'Travel' and 'Transport' services represent areas where India holds a relatively smaller share in global exports, at 2.1 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively, likely facing competition from other worldwide tourism and logistics hubs. There are opportunities for  further  growth,  especially  in  enhancing  international tourism infrastructure and global  transport  networks.  India's  financial  services  sector  lags  behind  the  global average,  highlighting  the  potential  for  growth  in  global  banking,  insurance,  and investment services. On the other hand, with a global share of 3.4 per cent in 'Personal, Cultural,  &amp;  Recreational'  services  and  3.5  per  cent  in  'Construction  services,'  India ranks 6th and 8th, respectively, demonstrating its competitive edge in cultural exports and international infrastructure projects.

3.37  India remains a global leader in IT and business services, but there is considerable untapped potential in travel, transport, and financial services. As the country becomes a  hub  for  Global  Capability  Centres  and  continues  to  innovate,  focusing  on  skill development and strategic policy interventions will be key to sustaining this momentum. Strengthening  emerging  sectors  and  improving  global  competitiveness  will  ensure

## India's e-commerce exports

3.38 The  e-commerce  industry  in  India  has  experienced  swift  expansion  over  the past  few  years,  driven  by  various  elements  such  as  the  rise  of  technology-powered advancements like online payments, localised delivery services, data-driven interactions with customers, and digital marketing. According to a report, the global B2C e-commerce market is expected to grow from USD 5.7 trillion in 2022 to USD 8.1 trillion by 2026 at a CAGR of 9.1 per cent. Correspondingly, India's B2C e-commerce market was worth USD 83 billion in 2022, and it is anticipated to grow to USD 150 billion by 2026, showing a CAGR of 15.9 per cent. 70  However, by current market size, India's e-commerce market makes up a small fraction, about 1.5 per cent of the global market, and it is projected to stay around 2 per cent in the coming years. These exports generated an estimated USD 4 to 5 billion in exports during FY23 and are expected to increase to USD 200 to USD 300 billion by 2030. 71  Box III.4 discusses the factors and policies that have played a key role in enhancing India's e-commerce exports.

## Box III. 4:  Factors driving India's e-commerce exports

Expanding data connectivity, increased penetration of smartphones, a rise in availability and use of digital wallets and safer online payments, increased customers' income levels and  growing  familiarity  with  digital  shopping  platforms  have  provided  an  impetus  to India's  e-commerce  exports.  Customers  increasingly  prefer  customised  products  from skilled artisans, and India can leverage its rich tradition of handcrafted items to meet this demand. Additionally, exporters can increase their profits by reducing costs associated with intermediaries  like  agents  and  shopkeepers,  making  e-commerce  a  lucrative  option  for selling products. 72

Government initiatives, such as Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat , have enhanced support and focus on MSMEs and e-commerce exports, thereby paving the way for more domestic sellers going global. These initiatives have provided a conducive environment for businesses to thrive and expand their reach. Recognising the relevance of e-commerce exports, the Foreign Trade Policy (FTP) 2023 has laid down provisions for fostering cross-border digital trade and promoting e-commerce and other emerging export channels. These include the Niryat Bandhu scheme 73 , financial assistance to e-commerce exporters under the Market Access Initiative (MAI) scheme, export and packing credit 74 , e-commerce exporthubs 75 ,

In  the  recent  past,  various  initiatives  have  been  undertaken  by  state  governments  in collaboration  with  e-commerce  market  players  to  boost  exports.  These  have  included organising e-export Haat 80  and signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with leading e-commerce players to drive e-commerce exports, etc. 81  The Uttar Pradesh government has recently implemented measures to enhance packaging and export capabilities by leveraging design, technology, and market access. The government is also planning to set up e-commerce hubs to facilitate small producers to sell to aggregators. 82  The governmen t of Telangana has announced a new MSME policy which, inter-alia, envisages an increase in e-commerce penetration in MSMEs by encouraging the participation of sellers on the ONDC portal and GeM portal. 83

The central government's E-Commerce Export Hub (ECEH) initiative aims to revolutionise India's cross-border e-commerce. These hubs connect SMEs, artisans, and One District One Product (ODOP) producers to global markets, boosting logistics efficiency and economic inclusion in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. On the Government e-Marketplace (GeM), revised pricing slabs now cap charges at ₹3 lakh for orders above ₹10 crore, significantly reducing transaction costs. The Bharat Mart in Dubai provides Indian MSMEs affordable access to the Gulf Cooperation Council, African, and CIS markets, enhancing exports to these regions. 84

The e-commerce export ecosystem in India presents opportunities for growth alongside a few challenges related to regulatory frameworks and compliance obligations. For example, the  roles  of  sellers  and  e-commerce  platform  operators  are  not  yet  clearly  defined.  This requires collaboration between sellers and e-commerce operators at various stages of export and  payment  processes.  Presently,  exports  are  facilitated  through  two  primary  modes, courier and cargo, with a courier export value limit of USD 12,0 00 (₹1 0 lakh), which is less compared to other countries. 85

85    In the case of China, the consignment limit for e-commerce exports is USD 50,000, https://content.dgft.gov.in/ Website/EcommExportHandbokMSME\_E.pdf.

Additionally,  the  absence  of  distinct  customs  supervision  codes  for  traditional  and e-commerce exports leads to delays in customs verification, and hinders data collection for further policy interventions. 86

The RBI manages the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) of 1999, which requires foreign exchange receipts within nine months of shipment. This timeline supports efficient transactions  but  may  pose  challenges  for  e-commerce  operators  handling  shipments sold  over  12  to  18  months.  It  opens  the  door  to  exploring  more  flexible  reconciliation timelines. The Export Data Processing and Monitoring System (EDPMS) aids in payment reconciliation, with costs ranging from USD 18 to USD 36 (₹1,500-₹3,000). There is a need for  cost  optimisation,  particularly  for  small-value  shipments.  Additionally,  reimporting of  e-commerce  refunds/rejects  is  exempted  from  duty  only  when  it  can  be  proven  that the  reimported  goods,  are  the  same  as  those  exported,  which  is  a  cumbersome  process. Simplifying these further could improve operational efficiency. 87

India's e-commerce exports hold immense potential to grow significantly and become a key contributor to the country's GDP. Addressing some of the existing challenges can further unlock opportunities for the sector to achieve its full potential and strengthen its position among leading global e-commerce exporters.
