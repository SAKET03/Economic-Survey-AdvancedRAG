EASE OF DOING BUSINESS INITIATIVES FOR EXPORTERS

3.39    An important area of focus is enhancing logistics efficiency to strengthen India's manufacturing and export capabilities. The development of logistics hubs, investments in infrastructure, and policy reforms to improve supply chain efficiency are measures in this direction. Such efforts aim to lower costs for Indian businesses, making exports more competitive and enabling quicker, smoother movement of goods domestically and internationally. This approach aligns with the government's commitment to the National Logistics Policy.

3.40 The paperless e-BRC system has reduced costs for 2.5 million e-BRCs annually by over ₹125 crore, streamlined processes and helped exporters benefit from schemes under the FTP. It has cut down both administrative and environmental expenses. Small exporters, especially in e-commerce, have benefitted from the system's efficiency in handling  high-volume,  low-cost  transactions,  enabling  them  to  claim  benefits  and refunds more effectively.

3.41    A new Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) 'Trade Connect e-Platform' has been launched which is a single window initiative enabling exporters to add newer markets.  The  e-platform  aims  to  transform  the  international  trade  landscape  for Indian  exporters,  especially  MSMEs.  The  platform,  developed  in  collaboration  with key partners, including the Ministry of MSME, EXIM Bank, Department of Financial Services, and the Ministry of External Affairs, is set to address information asymmetry by offering exporters comprehensive support and resources. It is a one-stop solution,

providing exporters with near real-time access to critical trade-related information while seamlessly connecting them to key government entities such as the Indian Missions abroad,  the  DoC,  Export  Promotion  Councils,  and  other  trade  experts.  Whether  a seasoned exporter or a new entrant, the platform is designed to assist businesses at every stage of their export journey. This e-platform shall connect more than 6 lakh IEC (Importer Exporter Code) holders, over 180 Indian Mission officials, and over 600 Export Promotion Council Officials, besides the officials from DGFT, DoC, banks, etc. 3.42    The  DGFT  Trade  Facilitation  Mobile  App  provides  all  information  on  FTP Updates, Import/Export Policy, Export/Import Statistics, the status of applications, and 24×7 virtual assistance. The department also provides 24×7 auto-generation of e-IEC. This enables users to not wait for any approval for an IEC. The IEC details are automatically validated against CBDT, MCA, and PFMS systems.
