# Optimising Lifestyles for Sustainable Development

OPTIMISING LIFESTYLES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

10.49  The  policy  framework  established  by  Multilateral  Environment  Agreements provides a foundational structure for advancing environmental sustainability. Effective implementation relies on countries' actions in achieving their national sustainability goals,  ultimately  determined  by  individual  behaviours.  Recognising  the  need  for  a movement mobilising collective will towards moderating consumption and production habits,  India  introduced  the  Lifestyle  for  Environment  (LiFE)  Mission  at  COP26  in Glasgow in 2021. The LiFE Mission encourages the adoption of lifestyles that are in harmony with nature and are environmentally friendly. This initiative aims to create a collective impact that is 'greater than the sum of its parts,' significantly shaping the way environmental and climate challenges  are  addressed.  With  its  endorsement  by the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) at its sixth session in 2024, the mission has evolved into a global mass movement committed to promoting sustainable lifestyles among all participating member states while aligning with the principle of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the Paris Agreement.

10.50   According to estimates, almost 17 per cent of all food available to consumers worldwide is wasted annually, amounting to more than 8 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is said that 'if food waste were a country, it would be the third-largest emitting country in the world '. 54 This highlights the significant potential for change through initiatives like Mission LiFE, which aims to mobilise at least one billion Indians and other global citizens to take both individual and collective actions to protect and conserve the environment from 2022 to 2028. Again, as brought out in the Economic Survey 2023-24, dietary preferences also impact emissions. Behavioural changes take time, as do lifestyle modifications. Household consumption accounts for around twothirds of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 55 . As per the UNFCCC, cutting dairy and meat from our diets can reduce our emissions by 66 per cent. 56 Switching to a plantbased diet can reduce an individual's annual carbon footprint by up to 2.1 tons with a vegan diet or up to 1.5 tons for vegetarians . 57  Nudging family, friends, and colleagues to a more sustainable dietary preference and moderation in lifestyles globally may be an idea whose time has come.

10.51 Within India, the goal is for at least 80 per cent of all villages and urban local bodies to become environmentally friendly by 2028 under this mission. The proactive implementation of LiFE measures can yield substantial co-benefits, including reducing inequalities in energy consumption, mitigating air pollution, achieving cost savings, and enhancing overall well-being and health. By 2030, it is estimated that these measures could save consumers around USD 440 billion globally through reduced consumption and lower prices. 58

10.52  There  are  several  effective  mechanisms  to  promote  low-carbon  lifestyles  and advance sustainable development. The Emissions Gap Report 2020 from the United Nations  Environment  Programme  (UNEP)  outlines  key  strategies  for  fostering meaningful lifestyle changes. Financial incentives, such as tax breaks for electric vehicles and  renewable  energy  use  subsidies,  can  motivate  individuals  and  organizations  to adopt greener practices. Additionally, educating the public about the environmental impacts  of  their  choices  is  essential.  Campaigns  that  highlight  the  benefits  of  lowcarbon alternatives and provide practical guidance can empower individuals to make sustainable  decisions.  Harnessing  social  influence  is  also  important.  By  leveraging peer pressure and engaging community involvement through social media and local initiatives, we can inspire sustainable behaviours and help establish a culture where low-carbon lifestyles are the norm.

10.53  Furthermore, encouraging citizen participation in sustainability decision-making at local and national levels is crucial for effective policymaking. Platforms for public input can lead to community-driven solutions. Finally, challenging existing habits and creating  new  norms  around  sustainability-such  as  promoting  cycling  or  local  food initiatives-can drive significant behavioural change over time. A combination of these

mechanisms is necessary to foster a transformative shift towards low-carbon lifestyles and a brighter, sustainable future.

10.54  The Indian government has introduced various measures to promote environmental  sustainability  and  influence  economic  behaviour.  Initiatives  like  the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyaan (PM KUSUM) and PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana encourage solar power adoption. High excise duties on fossil fuels and incentives for electric vehicles push for greener alternatives. The Ecomark scheme certifies eco-friendly household products, while the star-labelling scheme and 'Go Electric' campaign raise awareness about energy efficiency and electromobility. Market-based incentives, such as the Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme, enhance energy efficiency, and waste management regulations minimise environmental impact. Expanding city metro networks also promotes a shift from private to public transport for a more sustainable transportation option.

## Green Credit Programme

10.55  Several key initiatives have been taken to enhance pro-environment outcomes by implementing measures consistent with LiFE.  One notable example is the introduction of the Green Credit Rules, 2023, for implementation of the Green Credit Programme (GCP). These rules are designed to incentivise voluntary efforts toward environmental conservation, resulting in the issuance of green credits. To begin with, voluntary tree plantation is envisaged on degraded land under the control and management of Forest Departments. The Ministry published notification for 'methodology for calculation of green credit in respect of tree plantation' on 22 February 2024. GCP Portal has been developed and is accessible to public and participants. So far, Seventeen state forest departments  are  participating  as  implementing  agencies  with  48,074  hectares  of degraded land registered.

## Ek Ped Maa Ke Naam

10.56  The  tree  plantation  campaign  'Ek  Ped  Maa  Ke  Naam'  is  another  example  of nudging individual behaviour to promote pro-environmental activities. Launched in June 2024 on World Environment Day, the campaign attempts to leverage the deep love and respect for mothers towards conserving mother nature. It successfully met its  ambitious  goal  of  planting  80  crore  seedlings  by  September  2024.  It  achieved  a remarkable feat  by  planting  over  5  lakh  saplings  by  the  128  Infantry  Battalion  and Ecological Task Force of the Territorial Army in just one hour on 22 September 2024.

## Swachh Bharat Mission

10.57  The Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) launched in 2014 signifies a fundamental transformation in India's pursuit of universal sanitation access and has revolutionised

the  hygiene  practices  of  a  substantial  portion  of  the  Indian  population.  SBM  2.0 integrates  comprehensive  waste  management  and  sanitation  practices  aligned  with sustainability  and  circular  economy  principles.  The  chapter  on  'Investment  and Infrastructure' discusses SBM in detail.

## Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency

10.58  The key objective of promoting a circular economy is to minimise waste, recover valuable materials, and reduce reliance on virgin resources. According to an estimate, the circularity of resources could lead to cost savings of 11 per cent of current GDP in 2030 and 30 per cent in 2050. 59  India has followed a multi-pronged approach through regulatory measures, financial incentives, and awareness campaigns in support of the circular  economy  and  the  improvement  of  resource  efficiency.  Recycling  e-waste  is important to supplement India's renewable energy drive by extracting useful resources from  the  wastes  of  solar  and  wind  energy  equipment.  Therefore,  the  government provides incentives to promote circularity, including tax benefits, subsidies, and lowinterest loans to the recycling industry. 60 India's extended producer responsibility (EPR) framework is an innovative mechanism for waste management in which manufacturers and producers are made responsible for the waste generated by their products postconsumption.  The  EPR  framework  encourages  producers  to  adopt  sustainable product design practices, increases the use of recycled materials, and supports waste management and recycling initiatives.

10.59  Plastic pollution is a major driver of biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation and contributes to climate change. It will account for 15 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. 61  India is one of the lowest per capita plastic consumers and generators of plastic waste in the world, with per capita plastic consumption of only 14 kg compared to that of the developed economies, which is more than 100 kg, much above the global average of 35 kg. 62   India's  Plastic  Waste  Management  Rules,  2016 provides the statutory framework for environmentally sound plastic waste management in the country. The rules mandate urban local bodies and gram panchayats to undertake plastic waste management, including plastic waste collection, and impose restrictions on their open incineration. Measures such as the ban on identified single-use plastic

items, which have high littering potential and low utility, with effect from 1 July 2022, coupled  with  the  implementation  of  EPR,  will  further  reduce  pollution  caused  by littered and unmanaged plastic waste.

## AIR POLLUTION

10.60  The World Health Organisation (WHO) data show that almost all of the global population (99 per cent) breathe air that exceeds WHO guideline limits and contains high levels of pollutants, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures. 63   Air pollution is a concern for the people of the northern part of India, especially Delhi and NCR, during the transition months from autumn to winter when pollutant levels frequently exceed the WHO guidelines (Chart 8). While there are anthropogenic reasons for the increase in particulate matter, such as vehicular traffic due to a distinct modal choice for private vehicles, agricultural practices, and use of coal and wood for cooking, geography and wind direction also play an important part in keeping the particulate matter from being dispersed.

10.61  The government launched the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) in 2019 as a national-level strategy to reduce air pollution levels in 130 targeted non-attainment cities/million-plus cities across the country by implementing national, state and citylevel action plans. The NCAP emphasises the implementation of City Action Plans (CAPs) through the convergence of resources from various central government schemes such as Swachh Bharat Mission (Urban), AMRUT, Smart City Mission, SATAT, and Nagar Van Yojana, as well as through resources from state governments/UT administration and agencies like municipal corporations and urban development authorities. Actions

under  the  'Graded  Response  Action  Plan  (GRAP)'  are  also  imposed  based  on  AQI. The GRAP calls for a set of emergent preventive/restrictive actions depending on air pollution levels, to be implemented by the identified agencies for combating the adverse air quality scenario. To address the issue of stubble burning, the government launched a scheme for 'Promotion of Agricultural Mechanization for In-Situ Management of Crop Residue in the States of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh &amp; NCT of Delhi' in 2018, under which financial assistance is provided for the establishment of custom hiring centres (CHCs) and to farmers for purchase of crop residue management machinery.
