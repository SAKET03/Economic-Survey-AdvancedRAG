# Energy Transition - Learning from the Experience of Developed Countries and Weighing the options

ENERGY TRANSITION - LEARNING FROM THE EXPERIENCE OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND WEIGHING THE OPTIONS

10.22  The first major energy transition from wood to coal began in the early eighteenth century,  coinciding  with  the  advent  of  the  first  industrial  revolution.  Two  centuries later, coal was overtaken by oil and gas around 1946 (O'Connor, 2010), 16  and fossil fuels became the primary energy source (Solomon &amp; Krishna, 2011). 17  The energy transition from wood to coal was motivated by several factors, of which industrialisation in Britain and concerns over the loss of forests due to enhanced logging were pre-dominant (Smil, 2019). 18  A more recent transition from oil to nuclear energy in France that began in the

1970s was driven by the oil embargo by oil-producing countries in 1973 (Solomon &amp; Krishna, 2011) 19  and the intent to reduce dependence on imported oil.

10.23  The energy transitions witnessed till the last century were driven by commercial interests  rather  than  the  will  to  limit  the  emissions  from  advanced  economies. Commercial  interests  and  energy  security  remain  the  most  significant  factors  in the  transition  pathway  even  today.  In  2022,  the  European  Union  introduced  the REPowerEU plan, 20  which aims to reduce dependence on Russian gas supplies. The plan includes a budget of € 10 billion allocated for investment in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and an additional € 1.5 to 2 billion designated for securing oil supplies. The European Union further amended its sustainable taxonomy 21   to include generating power and heat from fossil gaseous fuels as a transitional activity. In 2023, the US administration also approved the onset of the country's largest oil drilling project in the Alaska region, with an estimated total oil and non-gas liquids production of 628.9 million barrels and 260.79 million metric tons of associated indirect carbon dioxide equivalent of emissions. 22 Actions speak louder than words, with the biggest beneficiaries of carbon-intensive growth over several centuries holding on to fossil fuels even as they would want the developing countries to take up the less efficient, costlier and riskier options.

10.24  Recent  data  about  the  G7  countries  (Charts  2  and  3)  for  almost  the  last  six decades (1992 to 2023) shows that these countries continue to rely heavily on fossil fuels in their per capita primary energy consumption, shifting from coal and oil-based energy to gas-based energy.

10.25  The  friction  between  energy  transition  and  energy  security  is  clearly  evident in  the  actions  of  developed  countries,  revealing  the  limitations  of  transitioning  to renewable energy sources such as wind and solar. First is the significant 'congestion cost' of managing a complex energy system incorporating fossil fuels and renewables. With the shift to renewable energy, there has also been an increasing trend in electricity prices (Chart 4). The congestion and higher cost have led to instances of wind turbines being curtailed due to grid limitations, necessitating the activation of gas plants to meet peak demand (Will Mathis, 2024) 23 , (Oliver, 2024) 24 . The shift from coal to natural gas as the base load has been the policy choice for ensuring grid stability in the UK and other developed countries. Developed countries have utilised their most abundant fuel in their transition. The transition to renewable energy has been tardy, forcing a return to fossil fuels to ensure stable supply and address rising electricity prices.

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development also includes a dedicated and stand-alone goal on energy, SDG 7, which calls for countries to "ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all".

energy mixes and energy efficiency scenarios, Bhattacharyya et al. 2022 26  estimated that the minimum level of per capita final energy requirement for India to become a developed country with an HDI of 0.9 must be in the range of 45.7 to 75 gigajoules per year. As per the Energy Statistics of India 2024, provisional estimates indicate that the total final consumption of energy per capita for FY23 was 16,699 megajoules or 16.7 gigajoules (~approx.), 27  indicating that the gap between actual and required future energy consumption to fuel growth to achieve Viksit Bharat status is quite huge.

10.27  One of the key pillars of SDG7 is the expansion of renewable energy; however, it is clear that even in the most advanced economies, the technologies for renewable energy and their implementation are not yet at a maturity level that allows them to fully replace fossil fuel-based power plants. Several challenges hinder renewable energy's cost-effective and efficient integration into the energy mix. These include significant investments required for grid integration, the development of battery infrastructure to manage intermittency, scaling up production of the components of renewable energy systems, access to critical minerals that are needed for storage technology, the limited availability of land in densely populated areas and the competing and rapidly increasing energy demands from agriculture, infrastructure, and industry.

10.28  Coal has an important role to play in India's sustainable development. 28  Around 88 per cent of the US's coal-fired capacity was built between 1950 and 1990. 29  On the other hand, the United Kingdom, driven by their industrialisation, started very early and their coal-run power plants dominating the energy supply till the late 1970s when natural  gas  was  identified  as  a  reliable  substitute. 30 In  India's  case,  most  capacity additions to the coal-fired power plants were made only in the 2010s. 31 There is no valid economic rationale for shutting down coal plants in India, leaving huge investments underutilised and stranded and without a dependable alternative in place. The US and European countries may transition from coal to natural gas because they have access to

that resource, and their older conventional coal-based thermal plants are nearing the end of their life cycle. Unlike many developed countries, India's only reliable energy source is coal, 32 as it possesses around 10 per cent of the world's coal reserves but only 0.7 per cent of the world's natural gas reserves. 33

10.29  Presently, given the resource endowments, coal cannot be neglected as a reliable and affordable source of energy for India's development. India has, however, taken a leading role in climate action, with the government implementing measures to reduce emissions in the economy. One key strategy has been to promote the efficient use of coal by utilising super-critical (SC), ultra-super-critical (USC) and the recent Advanced Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) technologies in coal-based power plants. Back in 2010, India commissioned its first power unit based on supercritical technology, and by the middle of 2024, a total capacity of 65,290 megawatts (94 Units) and 4,240 megawatts (06 units) in supercritical and ultra-supercritical technology-based power units have been  commissioned  respectively. 34   Further,  more  recently,  the  National  Thermal Power  Corporation  Limited  (NTPC)  and  Bharat  Heavy  Electricals  Limited  (BHEL) have developed an Indigenous Advance Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) technology and are setting up an 800-megawatt AUSC technology-based Thermal Power Plant. This AUSC power plant will reduce emissions by about 11 per cent compared to super-critical plants. 35

10.30  Among the other cleaner sources of energy, nuclear, being an efficient source of energy, has increasingly emerged as a reliable alternative to fossil fuel. However, there are challenges. The expansion of the use of nuclear power has to contend with public concerns about safety and the uncertainty that the latest technologies are controlled by a few countries (Jayanti, 2023). 36  Geographical concentration (Economic Survey, 20222023; 2023-2024) 37  of uranium and other essential minerals also poses a challenge. Besides,  nuclear  energy  relies  heavily  on  the  stability  of  fossil  fuel  supply  chains  to

produce sulfuric acid for uranium extraction (Maslin et al., 2022). 38  By 2040, estimates suggest that a shortfall of sulfuric acid supply could range from 100 million to 320 million tonnes, 39  depending on the extent of efforts to reduce carbon emissions. Furthermore, even in the short run, actions by key players can pose a risk to the growth of the nuclear power sector (Dempsey, 2024). 40  The significance of nuclear energy, given its higher efficiency and low greenhouse gas emissions, requires a forward-looking perspective to address potential challenges in advance, facilitating a smoother transition.

10.31 Further, the challenge of disposing of renewable energy technologies, especially solar panels, reveals how environmental policies can create complex issues. The state of California, a leader in promoting rooftop solar for two decades, did not develop a comprehensive  plan  for  managing  the  end-of-life  of  these  systems  (Kisela,  2022). 41 Disassembling and recycling solar panels is complex and demands highly specialised equipment and skilled workers. Implementing proper waste management strategies for renewable energy systems is imperative, as neglecting to address this issue could lead to significant environmental contamination. Effective disposal methods must be developed  to  manage  by-products  and  materials  associated  with  renewable  energy technologies to mitigate potential negative impacts on ecosystems and public health.

## BOX-X.4  New Emission Sources: Are they being accounted for?

The demand for electricity in the United States is projected to increase significantly 42 and in an unprecedented manner. 43  This surge is primarily attributed to the growing requirements associated with the expansion of artificial intelligence operations (Will Wade, 2024). 44

Globally, electricity consumption by data centres in 2022 was estimated at 460 terawatt hours -  around  two  per  cent  of  final  electricity  demand  and  is  estimated  to  reach  1000 terawatt-hours by 2026 (International Energy Agency, 2024). 45  These data centres alone will consume six per cent of the US's total electricity demand in 2026, estimated to be around

200 terawatt-hours or roughly four per cent of the country's national demand in 2022 (IEA, 2024). 46  Besides, the concerns about 'bad harmonics' 47  of the AI-led surge in power demand from data centres, adversely affecting households, are getting attention as well.

Until recently, the major technology firms have offset their substantial carbon emissions by purchasing 'unbundled' 48  renewable energy certificates (RECs). This practice has allowed them to present a façade of sustainability, as it enables them to claim that the electricity they consume-potentially  sourced  from  fossil  fuel  facilities  like  coal  plants-originates  from renewable sources such as solar farms (Rathi &amp; White, 2024) 49  and pay much less for the purchase of the unbundled REC than the actual cost of abatement of that one unit of GHG emission by them. Instead, the growing power demand from data centres is likely to cause further expansion in natural gas-based electricity, which will only increase the emissions of developed countries. 50

The engagement of advanced economies in harmonising their technological goals with the imperatives of the energy transition will become more apparent over time, but it is apparent that increases in emissions are not being factored in.

## PROGRESS MADE ON INDIA'S ENERGY TRANSITION

10.32    India's  efforts  in  mitigation  have  been  ambitious.  India  has  successfully established  an  installed  electricity  generation  capacity  of  213,701  megawatts  from non-fossil fuel sources, which accounts for 46.8 per cent of the total capacity as of 30 November 2024 (see Chart 5). 51  The goal is to reach 50 per cent by 2030.

## New initiatives  and  updates  on  existing  policies/schemes  to  boost energy transition

10.34  The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) initially launched New Solar Power Scheme (for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) Habitations/

Villages) under Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) on 4 January 2024, which was later revised on 18 October 2024 to also include other tribal habitations/villages and renamed as New Solar Power Scheme (for Tribal and PVTG Habitations/Villages) under PM JANMAN and Dharti Aabha Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (DA JGUA). The Scheme will cover electrification of one lakh unelectrified households (HHs) in Tribal and PVTG areas of over 63000 villages identified by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs (MoTA) by the provision of off-grid solar systems. The scheme also includes provision for off-grid solar lighting in 1500 Multi-Purpose Centres (MPCs) in PVTG areas and solarisation of 2000 public institutions through offgrid solar systems. The off-grid solar systems shall be provided only where electricity supply through grid is not techno-economically feasible.

10.35  Additionally, the PM - Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana aims to install rooftop solar plants in one crore households, which is expected to enable approximately 30 gigawatts of residential rooftop solar capacity and contribute to an overall rooftop solar capacity addition of 40-45 gigawatts by 2027. So far, rooftop solar systems for more than 7 lakh households (as on 9 January 2025) have already been installed.

10.36  In  offshore  wind  energy,  the  Viability  Gap  Funding  (VGF)  scheme  has  been introduced, featuring a total budget of ₹7,453 crore. This includes VGF of ₹6,853 crore allocated for one gigawatt of projects (500 megawatts each off the coasts of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu), and ₹600 crore grant designated for upgrading two ports to enhance logistic infrastructure.

10.37  The  projects  under  the  Green  Energy  Corridor  (GEC)  aim  to  establish  an intra-state transmission system that enhances grid capabilities for renewable energy. Currently,  GEC-I  is  being  implemented  across  eight  states,  successfully  installing 9,136  circuit  kilometres  of  transmission  lines  and  21,413  megavolt-amperes  (MVA) substations. Meanwhile, GEC-II is progressing across seven additional states.

10.38  The  National  Bioenergy  Programme  is  structured  around  three  main  pillars: the  Waste  to  Energy  Programme,  the  Biomass  Programme,  which  supports  the manufacturing of briquettes and pellets as well as promotes biomass (non-bagasse) based  cogeneration  in  industries,  and  the  Biogas  Programme,  which  focuses  on promoting family-type biogas plants. As of 31 December 2024, the installed capacity for biomass power and cogeneration projects stood at approximately 9.8 gigawatts (gridconnected)  and  0.92-gigawatt  equivalent  (off-grid),  while  waste-to-energy  projects reached  a  capacity  of  249.74  megawatts  (grid-connected)  and  370.19-megawatt equivalent (as on 9 January 2025) (off-grid). Under the biogas programme, around 5.1  million  small  biogas  plants  and  361  medium-sized  biogas  plants  (totalling  11.5 megawatts) have been installed.

10.39  Furthermore, the Scheme for the Development of Solar Parks and Ultra-mega Solar Power Projects sets a target for establishing 40,000 megawatts of capacity. This scheme  focuses  on  developing  essential  infrastructure  such  as  land,  roads,  power evacuation systems, and water facilities,  ensuring  all  necessary  statutory  clearances and approvals are in place for the expedited development of utility-scale solar projects. As of 31 December 2024, 55 Solar Parks with a cumulative capacity of 39.9 gigawatts have been sanctioned across 13 states. Notably, solar projects with a capacity of 12.2 gigawatts  have  already  been  commissioned,  while  others  are  at  various  stages  of implementation.

10.40  The  Pradhan  Mantri  Kisan  Urja  Suraksha  evam  Utthaan  Mahabhiyan  (PMKUSUM)  aims  to  add  34.8  gigawatts  of  solar  capacity  by  promoting  small  gridconnected solar energy power plants, stand-alone solar-powered agricultural pumps, and the solarisation of existing grid-connected agricultural pumps. As of 31 December 2024, a decentralised solar capacity of 397 megawatts has been installed, along with the solarisation of 7.28 lakh agricultural pumps under this scheme.

10.41  To enhance the manufacturing capabilities in the solar sector, the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for the National Programme on High-Efficiency Solar Photovoltaic Modules has been initiated. The goal is to achieve a gigawatt-scale manufacturing capacity of high-efficiency solar photo-voltaic modules. So far, Letters of Award have been issued to establish manufacturing units with a total capacity of 48,337 megawatts.

10.42  The National Green Hydrogen Mission aims to achieve a production capacity of about five million metric tonnes per annum of Green Hydrogen, along with an associated renewable energy capacity of around 125 gigawatts and the potential for 50 million metric tonnes of CO2 annual emission abatement by 2030. The mission also focuses on bolstering research and development, as well as standards and testing within the green hydrogen ecosystem. Under the mission, the green hydrogen production capacity of 412,000 tonnes per annum and electrolyser manufacturing capacity of 3000 megawatts per annum have been successfully awarded.

10.43  Lastly, the Central Public Sector Undertaking Scheme Phase-II aims to establish grid-connected  solar  photo-voltaic  power  projects  funded  by  CPSUs,  state  PSUs, and  government  organizations,  utilising  domestically  manufactured  solar  PV  cells and  modules  with  VGF  support.  Out  of  approximately  8.2  gigawatts  of  sanctioned solar photo-voltaic capacity, 1.81 gigawatts have already been commissioned as of 31 December 2024.

## Lessons Learned

10.44  Lessons  learnt  from  the  experiences  of  developed  economies  caution  against shutting down thermal energy without adequate technological alternatives that allow a  stable  energy  supply.  India  is  uniquely  positioned  in  terms  of  its  growing  energy requirements. India must decisively leverage its best resources, advanced technologies, and expertise to accelerate its journey toward becoming a developed nation by 2047 while  ensuring  a  low-carbon  pathway.  Following  this  critical  milestone,  the  nation must  pursue  its  ambitious  goal  of  achieving  net  zero  emissions  by  2070.  This  will demand innovative strategies  and  strong  implementation  plans  to  confront  climate challenges while ensuring sustainable development takes centre stage. Innovation and investment in addressing the problems related to renewable energy - battery storage, grid infrastructure and critical minerals - must be the focus in the short to medium term.

## Developments in financial regulation on green investments

10.45  Based  on  the  2019  National  Guidelines  on  Responsible  Business  Conduct (NGRBC)  by  the  government,  SEBI  introduced  new  reporting  mandates  on  ESG parameters - the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report (BRSR) - for the top  1000  listed  companies,  mandatory  from  FY23,  replacing  the  previous  Business Responsibility  Report  (BRR)  of  2012.  The  BRSR  norms  were  further  expanded  in 2023, with the Board introducing the BRSR core for assurance and ESG disclosures for value chains by the listed entities. The value chain for the purpose of BRSR core reports encompasses  the  top  upstream  and  downstream  partners,  cumulatively  comprising 75 per cent of the purchases/sales (by value), respectively. From FY26, the top 500 listed entities would be mandated to report under BRSR core, which will be expanded to the top 1000 listed entities from FY27 onwards. The BRSR Core consists of a set of  Key  Performance Indicators (KPIs)/metrics under nine ESG attributes, including GHG emission  footprints,  water  footprints,  energy  footprint,  embracing  circularity, enhancing  employee  well-being  and  safety,  enabling  gender  diversity  in  business, enabling inclusive development, fairness in engaging with customers and suppliers, and open-ness of business.

10.46  SEBI also introduced the regulatory framework for the issuance of green debt securities in 2017, which outlines an illustrative list of activities that can be financed through green debt securities. The framework was revamped in 2023 by introducing the concepts of transition bonds (funds raised for transitioning to a more sustainable form of operations, in line with India's Intended Nationally Determined Contributions), blue bonds (related to water management and marine sector), and yellow bonds (related to solar energy), and circular economy as sub-categories of the green debt securities. The

framework mandates the issuers of green debt securities to disclose details related to the perceived social and environmental risks and proposed mitigation plan associated with the project(s) proposed to be financed/refinanced through the proceeds from the issue of green debt securities, in the offer documents. By March 2024, green debt securities amounting to a total of ₹6,128 crore have been issued by various listed companies. 53

10.47  In addition to these measures, the Government of India has included Sovereign Green  Bonds  (SGrBs)  in  its  overall  market  borrowings  with  the  aim  of  mobilising resources  for  green  infrastructure.  Adhering  to  the  framework  for  sovereign  green bonds that sets forth the obligations of the Government of India as a green bond issuer, the government has issued various lots of SGrBs of varying maturities of 5, 10 and 30 years. On the whole, SGrBs worth ₹16,000 crore were issued in FY23 and ₹20,000 crore in FY24. As for FY25, so far, the Government of India has raised 10-year SGrBs worth ₹11,697.40 crores and plans to raise ₹10,000 crore in remaining period of H2 FY25, i.e., ₹5,000 crore each under 10-year and 30-year securities, respectively.

10.48  In order to foster and strengthen the country's green finance ecosystem, the RBI put in place the framework for accepting Green Deposits for Regulated Entities (REs), with effect from 1 June 2023, to encourage green deposits to augment the flow of credit to green activities/projects address greenwashing concerns. RBI has also classified bank loans of up to ₹30 crore for borrowers seeking funding for renewable energy projects under  the  priority  sector  lending  category.  This  includes  solar  power  generators, biomass-based power generators, windmills, micro-hydel plants, and renewable energy public utilities such as street lighting systems and remote village electrification.

## BOX-X.5  Growing Carbon sink of forests in India

India's NDC aims to increase the carbon sinks by 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent through improvement and addition of tree cover by 2030. As per the latest Forest Survey of India 2024, India is estimated to have a total carbon sink of 30.43 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2023, as compared to 2005, when the carbon sink was estimated to be 28.14 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. The addition to the carbon sink between 2005 and 2023 is of 2.29 billion tonnes CO2 equivalent, closer to the NDC target. Based on the trends, the FSI projects a carbon sink of 31.71 billion tonnes in 2030, which would even surpass the NDC target of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.
