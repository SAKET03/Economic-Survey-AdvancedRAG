# Bringing Adaptation to the Forefront

BRINGING ADAPTATION TO THE FOREFRONT

10.9 India is the seventh most vulnerable country to climate change. 7  It suffers from weather extremes and hazards, slow onset events such as sea-level rise, biodiversity loss, and water insecurity. While greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a global bad and the benefits of mitigation are diffused, vulnerable developing countries such as India have to bear a disproportionate burden of climate change and have no choice but to face the climate change consequence of historical emissions. The emissions remain with us. They impose huge costs on already resource-constrained countries. Hence, vulnerable developing countries such as India need to undertake climate adaptation on an urgent footing as this has a direct impact on lives, livelihoods and the economy.

10.10  The  Ministry  of  Environment,  Forest  and  Climate  Change  (MoEFCC)  has initiated the process of developing the National Adaptation Plan (NAP). The NAP is a vital strategic document articulating India's adaptation priorities. The process aims to develop a comprehensive and inclusive NAP that aligns with sustainable development goals and ensures climate resilience for all regions and sectors. This is in addition to the Initial Adaptation Communication submitted to the UNFCCC on 9 December 2023, highlighting the country's adaptation priorities, strategies, policies, and programmes along with implementation support needs for adaptation action.

10.11 Implementing  effective  adaptation  strategies  will  necessitate  a  multi-faceted approach  that  includes  policy  initiatives,  sector-specific  strategies,  development  of resilient  infrastructure,  research  and  development,  and  securing  financial  resources for adaptation efforts. Furthermore, these adaptation measures should be tailored to regional specificities, given India's significant diversity of geographic and agro-climatic conditions. The following subsections discuss the initiatives to build resilience across sectors.

## Adaptation in agriculture

10.12 Heat and water stress can negatively impact yields, posing challenges for India's food security. Adaptation strategies in agriculture have included enhanced focus on research and development of climate-resilient seeds, measures to preserve and enhance groundwater resources,  improve  soil  health,  and  modify  cropping  practices,  among other measures. The chapter on Agriculture and Food Management discusses measures to improve adaptation in agriculture in detail.

## Building resilience in urban areas

10.13 With  increasing  urbanisation  and  climate  change  impacts,  comprehensive adaptation action to address heat stress, urban flooding, and depleting groundwater in

cities has been gaining focus. The National Mission on Sustainable Habitat (NMSH), launched in 2010, one of the nine missions under the National Action Plan on Climate Change  (NAPCC),  seeks  to  promote  low-carbon  urban  development  and  bolster resilience  against  climate  change  impacts  through  five  key  thematic  areas:  waste management, water management, energy and green building, mobility and air quality, and urban planning, green cover, and biodiversity. In 2015, sustainable development and climate actions became integral to urban investments through various missions and programs. The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) has introduced a  unique  assessment  framework  for  cities  to  evaluate  climate-relevant  parameters, helping them adopt and share best practices. This framework aligns with international standards for green, sustainable, and disaster-resilient urban habitats, enabling Indian cities to promote sustainable urban development. 8

10.14 The  Atal  Mission  for  Rejuvenation  and  Urban  Transformation  (AMRUT)  is benefiting  citizens  by  improving  water  supply  systems,  augmenting  localised  water resources through the revitalisation of water bodies, enhancing groundwater recharge, increasing permeable green spaces, promoting the recycling and reuse of wastewater, and  implementing  energy  efficiency  reforms,  thus,  promoting  key  thematic  areas under the NMSH. As of December 2024, 785 stormwater drainage projects have been completed, eliminating 3,631 waterlogging points and constructing 1,380 kilometres of  drains  to  mitigate  the  effects  of  urban  flooding.  Work  is  currently  underway  to address an additional 285 waterlogging points. Additionally, 2,438 parks have been developed, contributing 5,070 acres of green space. Over 320 green mobility projects have been completed to encourage environmentally friendly modes of transport and infrastructure, creating 493 kilometres of walkways and cycle tracks.

10.15 AMRUT 2.0 9   aims to enhance ease of living by creating water-secure cities through water conservation, augmentation and rejuvenation. As of December 2024, 3,078 water body rejuvenation projects have been approved with the planned rejuvenation of 475 square kilometres area with 4.65 crore million litres per day (MLD) capacity, of which nine  water  rejuvenation  projects  have  been  completed.  These  projects  are  focused on sewer diversion/ treatment before discharge into water bodies, sustainability and emphasis on nature-based solutions. AMRUT 2.0 also focuses on the reuse of water and greywater management. As of December 2024, 1,437 MLD capacity has been developed for recycling/reuse.
