CONCLUSION

10.62  India's climate efforts are anchored in its ambitious commitment to achieve netzero emissions by 2070. This long-term goal is entwined with the country's aspirations for high and stable economic growth, which envisions becoming a developed nation by  2047.  Realising  this  vision  necessitates  a  delicate  balance,  achieving  low-carbon development while ensuring that critical imperatives such as affordable energy security, job  creation,  sustained  economic  expansion,  and  environmental  sustainability  are met.

10.63  To effectively navigate this dual challenge, India is adopting a holistic approach that embeds mitigation and adaptation in the growth strategy. Mitigation focuses on addressing the root causes of climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, while  adaptation  seeks  to  minimize  the  adverse  impacts  of  climate  change  through a robust framework for resilience. Given the backdrop of decreasing global financial commitments to support climate action in developing countries, India must increasingly prioritise  building  resilience  to  safeguard  the  benefits  of  its  rapid  economic  growth against climate-induced setbacks.

10.64  Adaptation and building resilience demand explicit and targeted policy measures, sufficient financing options, and the seamless integration of adaptive strategies into existing policies and developmental programs. It requires a multidimensional approach that encompasses a variety of initiatives, including the creation of appropriate policy incentives,  the  development  of  resilient  infrastructure,  research  and  development (R&amp;D) in climate-related technologies, and mobilising financial resources dedicated to adaptation initiatives. Additionally, it is essential that adaptation actions are tailored to be region-specific, considering India's vast and diverse geographic and agro-climatic landscape.

10.65  Despite being one of the world's lowest greenhouse gas emitters per capita, India has made notable strides in reducing the emissions intensity of its energy consumption.

This progress is largely due to the increased deployment of renewable energy sources alongside a suite of energy conservation measures. Nonetheless, the growth of renewable energy faces substantial hurdles, particularly in energy storage technologies and the sourcing of critical minerals necessary for this transition. While alternative solutions such as green hydrogen present a viable option for the medium term, affordability issues remain a significant barrier to widespread adoption. Furthermore, although nuclear energy could contribute to India's energy mix, its expansion is impeded by a lack of a supportive ecosystem and the monopolistic nature of nuclear fuel supply chains.

10.66  Lessons learned from the experiences of developed economies underscore the risks of prematurely shutting down thermal energy sources without viable technological alternatives  that  ensure  a  stable  energy  supply.  The  challenges  mentioned  above  in harnessing  renewable  energy  at  scale  indicate  that  India  will  need  to  continue  the efforts  to  maximise the efficiency of its existing fossil fuel resources in the medium term. The advancement and deployment of low-emission thermal power technologies, including Advanced Ultra Super Critical (AUSC) power plants, will play a pivotal role in this transition.

10.67  Investments in research and development related to battery storage technologies, as well as the recycling and sustainable disposal of waste associated with renewable energy  systems,  are  critical  factors  in  ensuring  a  reliable  supply  of  energy  from renewable sources and its sustainability. The mission mode approach to developing carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology is essential for the continued use and enhancement of thermal power plants in the medium term. In the agricultural sector, developing climate-resilient seeds and improving agricultural practices, which may include the  rejuvenation  of  water  bodies,  will  be  vital  components  in  building resilience against climate impacts.

10.68  The promotion of pro-environment lifestyle changes, as envisaged under India's LiFE Mission, has significant potential to contribute to climate change mitigation by encouraging low-carbon lifestyles and energy conservation behaviours. To transform the  LiFE  mission  into  a  widespread  public  movement,  a  comprehensive  awareness campaign is crucial-this could include integrating the principles of the LiFE mission into  school  and  college  curricula  to  foster  an  environmental  consciousness  from a  young  age.  The  successful  implementation  of  the  LiFE  initiative  could  provide India  with  compelling  evidence  of  achieving  more  sustainable  outcomes  with  fewer resources.

10.69  Accomplishing the goal of net zero emissions by 2070 will require innovative strategies and robust implementation plans designed to confront both the challenges

posed by climate change and the need for sustainable development to take centre stage. To  strengthen  its  renewable  energy  initiatives,  India  must  prioritise  investment  in extensive grid infrastructure improvements and the secure sourcing of critical minerals necessary for this transformative shift.
