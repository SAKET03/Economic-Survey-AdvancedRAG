# Global Inflation

global inflation peaked in 2022 due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, it has declined since then, aided by policy measures. In India, retail inflation eased in FY25 due to timely interventions by the government and the Reserve Bank of India. Core inflation reached its lowest point in a decade, while food inflation was affected by supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions.

Onion and tomato prices are affected by the decline in production, partly due to extreme weather conditions and monsoon-induced supply chain disruptions. On pulses, despite being a major producer, India faces a gap in demand and supply. The government has undertaken several measures to rein in the prices of  vegetables  like  onion  and  tomato  which  included  procurement  and  buffer stocking of onion under price stabilisation fund and subsidised sale of onion and tomato. Also, many administrative measures have been taken-up to address the price pressures in pulses such as subsidised retail sale, stock limits and easing imports.

Estimates suggest that India's retail price inflation will align progressively with the target. Global commodity prices are expected to decline, potentially easing core and food inflation. Long-term price stability could be achieved by robust data systems for monitoring prices, developing climate-resilient crops, reducing crop damage and post-harvest losses.
