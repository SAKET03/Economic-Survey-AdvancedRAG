## PRICES AND INFLATION: UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS

CHAPTER

<!-- image -->

In  gauging  the  health  of  the  global  economy,  understanding  the  trends  in inflation is essential. While global inflation peaked in 2022 due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, it has declined since then, aided by policy measures. In India, retail inflation eased in FY25 due to timely interventions by the government and the Reserve Bank of India. Core inflation reached its lowest point in a decade, while food inflation was affected by supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions.

Onion and tomato prices are affected by the decline in production, partly due to extreme weather conditions and monsoon-induced supply chain disruptions. On pulses, despite being a major producer, India faces a gap in demand and supply. The government has undertaken several measures to rein in the prices of  vegetables  like  onion  and  tomato  which  included  procurement  and  buffer stocking of onion under price stabilisation fund and subsidised sale of onion and tomato. Also, many administrative measures have been taken-up to address the price pressures in pulses such as subsidised retail sale, stock limits and easing imports.

Estimates suggest that India's retail price inflation will align progressively with the target. Global commodity prices are expected to decline, potentially easing core and food inflation. Long-term price stability could be achieved by robust data systems for monitoring prices, developing climate-resilient crops, reducing crop damage and post-harvest losses.

## INTRODUCTION

4.1.  In the ever-evolving landscape of global economics, understanding the dynamics of inflation is crucial. The persistent inflationary pressures pose several challenges for policymakers and the general public. On the global front, central banks are cautiously unwinding their restrictive policies to balance inflation control with economic recovery. In India, the various government initiatives and monetary policy reviews are helping to keep inflationary pressure at check.

- 4.2.  Global inflation peaked at 8.7 per cent in 2022, driven by supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, to 5.7 per cent in 2024 1 . In India, retail inflation moderated from 5.4 per cent in FY24 to 4.9 per cent in FY25 (April-December) despite challenging food price dynamics. Food items constitute about two-fifths of the consumer price index in India. Hence, the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) is a significant determinant of retail inflation. In recent years, food inflation has been a major contributor to headline inflation. However, an increase in prices is not widespread across all food categories. It is primarily driven by a few items.
- 4.3.  Given this context, the chapter is organised into four sections. Section 2 analyse the global inflation, while Section 3 examines the domestic inflation trends and discusses the proximate factors affecting inflation dynamics. The chapter concludes with a set of  recommendations in Section 4. The idea behind this presentation plan is to give an overview about inflation dynamics to policymakers and stakeholders to help them navigate the complexities of managing inflation.

## GLOBAL INFLATION

## Global resilience amid synchronised monetary policy tightening

4.4.  Despite the sharp and synchronised tightening of monetary policy across countries, the global economy has demonstrated an unusual level of resilience in output growth throughout the disinflationary process. This resilience is reflected in the steady decline of the headline inflation rate in most countries during FY24 and the current year. The concerted efforts by central banks to curb inflation through increased interest rates and other policy measures have yielded positive outcomes, resulting in a significant reduction in inflationary pressures.

## Decline in core inflation

4.5.  In alignment with the downward trend in headline inflation, core inflation, which excludes  volatile  food  and  energy  prices  has  also  decreased  in  most  countries.  The decline can be predominantly attributed to a moderation in international commodity prices.  This  trend  highlights  the  effectiveness  of  policy  interventions  in  stabilising prices across various sectors.

## Global food inflation eases with divergence in a few EMEs

4.6.  Global food inflation is on a downward trend, aligning with the patterns observed in both headline and core inflation. Improving global supply conditions due to solid harvests  and  favourable  growing  conditions  contributed  to  the  softening  of  food prices 2 . However, some emerging economies, such as Brazil, India, and China have a contrasting pattern.

## DOMESTIC INFLATION

## Softening core inflation cools headline inflation

4.7.  India's  headline  inflation,  measured  by  the  Consumer  Price  Index  (CPI),  has moderated  in  FY25  (April-December)  compared  to  FY24.  This  decline  is  primarily due to a significant decrease in core inflation, which dropped by 0.9 percentage points between FY24 and FY25 (April-December). The sharp decline in core inflation was largely driven by core services inflation, which was lower than core goods inflation. A decrease in fuel price inflation has also contributed to the moderation in headline inflation, alleviating pressure on household budgets. In general, the decline in retail inflation can be attributed to a reduction in input prices, as reflected in wholesale price inflation, which was in the deflationary zone (-0.7 per cent) in FY24 and remained low in FY25 (April-December).

## Food Inflation is majorly driven by very few food items

4.8.  Over the past two years, India's food inflation rate has remained firm, diverging from global trends of stable or declining food inflation. This can be attributed to factors such as supply chain disruptions exacerbated by extreme weather events and reduced harvest of some food items.

4.9.  Food inflation, measured by the CFPI, faced pressures in FY25 (April-December), primarily driven by a few food items such as vegetables and pulses. Vegetables and pulses together holds a total weightage of 8.42 per cent in CPI basket. However, their contribution to the overall inflation stood at 32.3 per cent in FY25 (April to December). When these items are excluded, the average food inflation rate for FY25 (April-December) was 4.3 per cent, which is 4.1 per cent lower than the overall food inflation. Similarly, the average headline inflation would be 3.2 per cent when the vegetables and pulses inflation rate were excluded, 1.7 per cent lower than the actual headline inflation.

4.10.  Uneven  monsoon-induced  supply  disruptions  in  certain  regions  caused  price pressures,  mainly  in  tomatoes  and  onions,  contributing  to  higher  inflation  rates  in vegetables and overall food inflation. When we exclude the three most price-sensitive vegetables (tomato, onion and potato (TOP)) from the CPI basket, the average food inflation rate in FY25 (April-December) was 6.5 per cent, which is 1.9 per cent lower than the current food inflation. Similarly, average headline inflation is 4.2 per cent when excluding TOP, which is 0.7 per cent lower than the current headline inflation. Given that  tomato and onion prices have been drivers of food inflation, and consequently headline inflation in recent months, the next section will explore the causes  of price pressure in these vegetables.

## Extreme weather conditions impact vegetable production and prices

4.11 Vegetables are more susceptible to uneven weather compared to food grains, as highlighted by various studies. Extreme weather events such as cyclones, heavy rains, floods,  thunderstorms,  hailstorms,  and  droughts  impact  vegetable  prices.  Further, evidence  indicates  that  inflationary  pressure  in  horticultural  commodities  in  202324 was driven by unseasonal rainfall during the pre-monsoon season, which damaged crops  in  major  horticulture-producing  states 3 .  The  coexistence  of  good  areas  sown coupled with greater price volatility suggests that extreme weather events significantly impact production and supply chains, thereby affecting retail prices.

4.12.  The  data  accessed  from the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Ministry of  Earth  Sciences  indicates  a  notable  increase  in  the  frequency  of  extreme  weather conditions, particularly heatwaves. On an average, during 2022-2024, India experienced heatwaves on 18 per cent of days compared to 5 per cent of days in 2020 and 2021.

4.13.   Data published by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and Down to Earth (DTE) 5,6   finds that the total crop area damaged in 2024 was higher compared to the last two years due to extreme weather events.

4.14.  The  increasing  frequency  of  extreme  weather  events-specifically  uneven  and unseasonal rainfall and heat waves -  impacts vegetable production, thereby increasing prices. These adverse weather conditions also present significant challenges to storage and transportation, resulting in temporary disruptions to the supply chain and causing an increase in vegetable prices. This phenomenon is also corroborated by a positive correlation between the frequency of extreme weather events occurring within a given month  and  the  vegetable  inflation  rates  observed  in  the  subsequent  months,  with notable effects evident for up to three months following such events.

4.15.   Furthermore, the fall in onion and tomato production in the last two years can be  partially  explained  by  higher  extreme  weather  events  in  major  producing  states compared to other regions.

## Trends in onion and tomato production and prices

4.16. The inflationary pressures in onion remained firm in FY24 and the current year, despite  prompt measures by the government to contain prices due to constrained supply  resulting  from  reduced  production.  Onions  are  grown  in  both  the  Kharif and Rabi seasons, with around 70 per cent of production occurring during the Rabi season 7 . Fresh onions generally last about 2-3 months when stored in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place, with their shelf life further extendable under a dehumidified environment. Thus, onions produced in one year - specifically Rabi onions harvested from March onwards are typically available for consumption in the following year, influencing  inflation  dynamics  in  that  year.The  lower  production  in  2022-23  and 2023-24 has consequently led to inflationary pressures in onions for FY24 and FY25 (April-December)(Chart IV.6b).

4.17.  The price pressures in tomatoes remained intermittently high since FY23 due to constrained supply (Chart IV.6a). This occurred despite earnest efforts by the government to improve supply conditions in deficient regions by procuring from producing regions. The inflation dynamics of tomatoes are influenced by multiple factors. Unlike onions, tomatoes have short crop cycles and are highly perishable, creating challenges in storage and transportation and leading to supply shortages and price spikes. Fresh tomatoes have a shelf life of only about 1-2 weeks when stored properly. Tomato production is mainly concentrated in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Odisha. This regional concentration makes the supply chain vulnerable to disruptions in any of these areas. Similar to onions, a major portion of tomato production - more than 65 per cent 8 - occurs in the Rabi season.

## Consumption and seasonality in production of onion and tomato

4.18.  Analysis of production and consumption trends over the past three years shows that domestic household consumption is lower than production for both tomatoes and onions. Horticultural Statistics at Glance 2021 9 , indicates that approximately 15 per cent of production is used for bulk consumption in hotels, marriages etc. Even while treating this as a net additionality to household consumption, the production is still higher.  Therefore,  it  turns  out  that  price  pressures  are  not  fundamentally  due  to  a shortfall in production but to post-harvest losses, seasonal production, and regional dispersion in production. Also, onion exports averaged more than 6 per cent of domestic production during FY20 to FY24.

<!-- image -->

4.19.    For  instance,  tomato  prices  typically  rise  from  July  to  September,  the  lean production  season  coinciding  with  the  monsoon,  adding  to  challenges  related  to distribution  and  increased  transit  losses.  Onion  prices  tend  to  increase  from  October to  December,  representing  a  lean  season  for  onion  production.  India's  status  as  the major producer and consumer of onion and tomato significantly limits the potential to import during times of seasonal supply and demand imbalances. Given that India and China contribute about half of the total production of onion 10 , the import options for India  during  periods  of  demand-supply  imbalances  are  quite  limited.  The  next  eight major producing countries only contribute around 18 per cent of the production. Also, the highly perishable nature of tomatoes restricts import options from neighbouring countries, which are not significant producers of tomatoes. Consequently, India faces challenges in importing these essential commodities.

## Trends in production and inflation rate of tur

4.20.  In addition to tomato and onion, tur dal also contibuted to food inflation in India. The deficient production of tur in 2022-23 and 2023-24 has indeed led to high price pressures in tur dal during FY24 and FY25 (April-December), despite various measures by the government to shore up the supply in consuming regions. Production declined by 13.6 per cent in 2022-23 and 10.8 per cent in 2023-24 compared to the last 5-year average, affecting the supply. Over the past decade, there has been a strong negative correlation (-0.8) between the annual inflation rate and the 1-year lagged production, indicating that lower production in one year typically results in higher inflation in the following year. As a major Kharif pulse, tur is harvested from November to January, with its price impact mainly observed in the subsequent financial year.

<!-- image -->

4.21.    Despite  these  challenges,  the  government  is  actively  working  to  ensure  an adequate supply of tur dal to consumers. To ensure that the produced quantity reaches the market and to prevent stockpiling, the government is taking proactive measures by periodically imposing stock limits for tur, and active monitoring through the stock disclosure portal. Further, to meet the demand for tur, the country imported 7.7 lakh tonnes of tur in FY24, mainly from Mozambique, Tanzania, Malawi, and Myanmar.

## OUTLOOK AND WAY FORWARD

4.22. The RBI and the IMF have projected that India's consumer price inflation will progressively align towards the inflation target in FY26. In the December 2024 RBI's Monetary Policy Committee report revised its inflation projection from 4.5 per cent to 4.8 per cent in FY25. Assuming a normal monsoon and no further external or policy shocks, the RBI expects headline inflation to be 4.2 per cent in FY26. IMF has projected an inflation rate of 4.4 per cent in FY25 and 4.1 per cent in FY26 for India.

4.23.  As per World Bank's Commodity Markets Outlook 12 , October 2024, commodity prices are expected to decrease by 5.1 per cent in 2025 and 1.7 per cent in 2026. The projected declines are led by oil prices but tempered by price increases for natural gas and a stable outlook for metals and agricultural raw materials. Among precious metals, gold prices are expected to decrease while silver prices are expected to increase. Prices for metals and minerals are expected to decline, primarily due to a decrease in iron ore

12  Commodity Markets Outlook, World Bank, October 2024, (https://tinyurl.com/dyduh9tu)

and zinc prices. In general, the downward trend movement in the prices of commodities imported by India is a positive for the domestic inflation outlook.

<!-- image -->

4.24. A  normal  southwest  monsoon  in  2024  has  improved  the  water  levels  in reservoirs, ensuring sufficient water for irrigation during the rabi crop production. As per the first advanced estimates of agricultural production for 2024-25, Kharif food grain production is expected to increase by 5.7 per cent. The production of rice and tur, the most important Kharif food grains, is expected to increase by 5.9 per cent and 2.5 per cent, respectively, as compared to 2023-24. This could lead to softening of food inflation pressures over the course of the year. However, rising international vegetable oil prices may pose an upside risk to food inflation. The government has focused on controlling food inflation through various supply side measures, which include strengthening the buffer stock of essential food items and periodic open market releases, subsidised retail sale of essential food items in specified outlets, easing imports of the essential food items through rationalisation of duties, prevention of hoarding through imposition/ revision and monitoring of stock limits. The budget 2024-25 has envisaged measures like large-scale clusters for vegetable production, promotion of farmer-prodcuer organisations, cooperatives and start-ups for vegetable supply chains and measures for achieving self-sufficiecny in pulses and oilseeds.

4.25.  The following options may be worth considering from the perspective of ensuring long-term price stability.

- ¾ India faces a persistent deficit in the production of pulses and oilseeds, along with frequent fluctuations in tomato and onion production, leading to price pressures. To address this, focused research is needed to develop climate-resilient crop varieties, enhancing yield and reducing crop damage. Efforts to expand the area under pulses in rice-fallow regions are likely to help.

- ¾ Promoting extension activities is crucial. Farmers should receive training on best practices, the use of high-yield and disease-resistant seed varieties, and targeted interventions to improve agricultural practices in the major growing regions for pulses, tomatoes, and onions.
- ¾ Implementing robust data collection and analysis systems to monitor prices, stocks, and storage and processing facilities is essential in various tiers of government. This data should be used to identify areas for improvement and make informed policy decisions. High-frequency price monitoring data for essential food items collected by various agencies within the country may be linked to quantify and monitor price build-up at each stage from the farm gate to the final consumer.
