# Global Economic Scenario

global economic scenario comprehensively, highlighting growth and inflation trends, policy stances, and key emerging risks and uncertainties. The  second  section  focuses  on  the  domestic  macroeconomic  situation,  examining developments from the demand and supply sides. The third section delves into the emerging trends in public finances, inflation, external sector, financial markets and employment. The concluding section presents the prospects and outlook for growth in the presence of global headwinds while capitalising on domestic growth drivers.

## GLOBAL ECONOMIC SCENARIO

## Steady global growth and varied regional dynamics

1.2 Globally,  2024  has  been  an  eventful  year.  The  year  witnessed  unprecedented electoral activity on the political front, with more than half of the global population voting in major elections across countries. Meanwhile, adverse developments like the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Hamas conflict increased regional instability. These events impacted energy and food security, leading to higher prices and rising inflation. Cyberattacks also became more frequent and severe, with growing human and financial consequences due to the increasing digitisation of critical infrastructure. 1 Geopolitical  tensions,  have  reshaped  global  trade.  Geopolitical  risks  and  policy uncertainty,  especially  around  trade  policies,  have  also  contributed  to  increased volatility in global financial markets. 2

- 1.3 Nonetheless, global economic growth has remained fairly moderate. The global economy grew by 3.3 per cent in 2023. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected growth of 3.2 per cent and 3.3 per cent for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Over the next five years, global growth is expected to average around 3.2 per cent, which is modest by historical standards. While the overall global outlook remains steady, growth varies across different regions.

- 1.4 Despite higher interest rates, advanced economies (AEs) witnessed stable growth in the first half of 2024. This was on account of moderating inflation and sustained employment  and  consumption. 3   However,  the  growth  outlook  differs  between  the United States (US) and the Euro Area. Growth in the US is expected to remain strong at 2.8 per cent in 2024 and may decline slightly in 2025, reflecting a moderation in consumption and exports. 4
- 1.5 In  the  Euro  area,  growth  is  expected  to  improve  from  0.4  per  cent  in  2023  to 0.8 per cent in 2024 and further to 1.0 per cent in 2025 on the back of improving services activity. However, growth outcomes in Europe have been varied. Some countries like Spain, France, Poland, and the United Kingdom have benefitted from the strength of their services sector. Meanwhile, manufacturing-intensive countries like Germany and Austria are being weighed down by weak demand. 5  Germany's structural weaknesses, particularly  in  manufacturing  (Chart  I.3),  have  been  noticeable,  contributing  to  the slackness in Europe's manufacturing. Political developments in France and Germany are also adding to policy uncertainty in Europe's major economies.
- 1.6 The divergence of the growth trajectories of Europe and the US can also be seen in Citi Economic Surprises indices for these countries (Chart I.4). These indices compare actual data releases with analyst expectations. A value above zero indicates the data

was stronger than analyst expectations, while a negative value indicates weaker actual data compared to expectations. Between January 2023 and November 2024, data for the US economy continued to present more 'positive' surprises than the EU, compared to the analyst estimates.

- 1.7 Within Asia, Japan's growth was hindered by domestic supply disruptions in the early part of the year, while China's growth weakened after the first quarter, affected by sluggish private consumption and investment, alongside challenges in the real estate sector. 6

## Services sector growth steady; manufacturing faces challenges

1.8 The  global  composite  Purchasing  Managers'  Index  (PMI)  has  stayed  in  the expansion zone for the fourteenth month in a row (as of December 2024). The services sector continues to show strength while manufacturing PMI indicated contraction. 7

- 1.9 In 2024, the global manufacturing PMI started strong, moving into expansion for the first time since mid-2023 and remained so through the first half of the year. By July 2024, weaker conditions pushed the PMI back into contraction. Following four months of gradual declines, the global manufacturing sector stabilised in November with an index value of 50.0, indicating no overall change in operating conditions. 8   Output growth in consumer and intermediate goods offset a downturn in investment goods. Increased production was attributed to stabilising new order intakes and the clearance of backlogs of work.

1.10  Production trends varied widely across regions in December (Chart I.6 and I.7). Production rose in 13 of the 30 nations for which December PMI data were available. The  Eurozone  saw  the  steepest  contractions,  led  by  France,  Germany,  and  Austria. North America showed mixed results, with Canada's growth offset by declines in the US and Mexico. India reported the strongest expansion of output. The outlook for global manufacturing also remained subdued in December, with business sentiment dipping to a three-month low. 9

1.11  On the global services front, the global Services PMI Business Activity Index rose to a four-month high of 53.8 in December. This signals expansion for the twenty-third consecutive month. Expansion was recorded across business, consumer, and financial services. Financial services experienced the fastest pace of expansion.

## Inflationary pressures ease, but risks of synchronised price pressures persist

1.12  Inflation rates across economies have trended downward steadily, approaching central bank target levels. This has been the result of tighter monetary policy regimes across the globe and supply chains adapting to higher levels of economic uncertainty. As a consequence, price pressures eased in 2023 due to a reduction in fuel prices. In

2024, it was attributed to a broad-based reduction in goods inflation.

1.13  However,  disinflation  seems  to  have  slowed  due  to  the  persistence  of  services inflation,  while  core  goods  inflation  has  fallen  to  negligible  levels.  The  IMF  World Economic  Outlook  (WEO)  October  2024  reasons  that  this  is  on  account  of  higher nominal wage growth as compared to pre-pandemic trends. The report notes that there are early signs that these pressures are abating, thereby aiding the disinflation process.

1.14  However, recent disruptions in global shipping  have pushed goods prices up. These events have also pressurised the global supply chains. This is reflected in higher levels of the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) in the quarter ending September 2024. Chart I.10 shows that while container freight  rates  normalised  in  2023,  they experienced a significant surge in 2024. This was due to stronger demand, shipping route disruptions in the Red Sea, and delays at the Panama Canal, all of which have partially sustained inflationary pressures. 10

1.15  The risk to inflation from increases in commodity prices seems limited in 20252026. After softening in 2024, commodity prices are expected to decline moderately (Chart I.12). While this easing is a positive sign, the risk of synchronised price increases remains, especially during periods of global economic stress. Although recent shocks like  geopolitical  conflicts  and  extreme  weather  have  caused  price  fluctuations,  their impact  has  largely  subsided,  leading  to  more  varied  commodity  prices.  However, escalating tensions continue to pose a risk of synchronised price increases, undermining the effectiveness of inflation mitigation. 11

## Easing monetary policy stances amidst divergent expectations

1.16  Taking  advantage  of  the  steep  decline  in  inflation,  major  central  banks  have implemented  a  policy  pivot  to  lower  policy  rates.  Given  the  differentials  in  the trajectories of economic activity across countries, the pace of policy rate reduction is bound to differ. There is also uncertainty regarding the levels of the year-ahead and terminal policy rates across economies at the end of the current monetary easing cycle.

## Chart I.13: Increased uncertainty over the long-term level of Federal Funds rate

1.17  In the short term, the US market expectations of the Federal Funds Rate (FFR) were much lower than the actual FFR level for both 2023 and 2024. Similar uncertainty may persist over the course of 2025. 12  One way to visualise the uncertainty regarding the FFR over the long term is through the expectations of policymakers about the 'longrun' policy rate. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) presents a dot-plot of its members' assessment of the direction of the policy rate over different time horizons. Chart I.13 presents the dot-plots that represented the FOMC members' assessments in December 2021, December 2023, and December 2024. The dot-plots show that while

the long-run policy rate is likely to be higher, the variance in members' expectations is also larger, indicating increased uncertainty over the terminal policy rate.

1.18  The success in inflation control, the consequent easing of monetary policies, and expectations of lower borrowing costs began to reflect in the downward trajectory of sovereign  bond  yields  of  advanced  economies  between  April  and  September  2024. However, renewed global uncertainty over inflationary pressures and the direction of monetary policies have pushed bond yields up in October - December 2024. Lower growth  prospects  and  deflationary  pressures  have  pushed  Chinese  sovereign  bond yields  lower,  thereby  widening  the  sovereign  yield  spread  between  the  world's  two largest economies.

## Geopolitical uncertainties continue to pose risks to the global economic outlook

1.19  Geopolitical  risks  remain  elevated  (Chart  I.18)  due  to  ongoing  conflicts,  which pose significant risks to the global economic outlook. These risks can influence growth, inflation,  financial  markets,  and  supply  chains.  An  intensification  of  the  evolving conflicts  in  the  Middle  East,  or  the  Russia-Ukraine  conflict,  could  lead  to  market repricing of sovereign risk in the affected regions and disrupt global energy markets. The oil market is well-supplied for now. However, any damage to energy infrastructure could tighten supply, adding uncertainty to the global economic outlook. 13

1.20 Tensions  in  the  Middle  East  have  disrupted  trade  through  one  of  the  critical shipping routes - the Suez Canal. About 15 per cent of global maritime trade volume normally passes through the Suez Canal. In response, several shipping companies have diverted their ships around the Cape of Good Hope, which has increased delivery times by 10 days or more, on average. These disruptions have led to higher freight rates along major shipping routes, which in turn impact global trade activity.

<!-- image -->

1.21  Heightened  risks  are  also  evidenced  by  other  indices,  such  as  the  Geopolitical Economic Policy Uncertainty index, which remains elevated due to global concerns about  economic  policies.  Similarly,  the  World  Trade  Uncertainty  Index  has  risen, driven by trade tensions and policy shifts in major economies. Trade policy uncertainty has increased sharply in recent months, though it has not yet reached the levels seen in 2018-19. The stock of import-restrictive measures within G20 economies continues to

grow, now affecting 12.7 per cent of G20 imports-more than three times the coverage of such measures in 2015. If uncertainty persists and trade-restrictive measures continue to rise, they could increase costs and prices, deter investment, hinder innovation, and ultimately reduce global economic growth. In light of these developments, Chapter 5 of the Survey on the Medium-Term Outlook elaborates on the global factors and the importance of strengthening the levers of domestic growth.
