# Economy Characterised by Stability and Inclusivity on Multiple Fronts

ECONOMY CHARACTERISED BY STABILITY AND INCLUSIVITY ON MULTIPLE FRONTS

## Improving public finances support macro stability

1.43 Since the COVID-19 pandemic, judicious fiscal management has helped to rein in general government dis-savings (Chart I.33). This assumes greater significance in sustaining the overall savings in the economy. With private corporate savings hovering around  14  per  cent  of  GDP,  persistent  general  government  dis-savings  could  have implied a greater reliance on foreign funding. Prudent fiscal management in the last four  years  kept  the  overall  savings-investment  gap  from  widening  and  ensured  a comfortable financing of the current account deficit, even though the household saving rate moderated. (Chart I.34 below).

## Fiscal discipline of the union government

1.44 The Union government's indicators of fiscal discipline have improved progressively. Quality  of  expenditure  approximated  by  capital  expenditure  as  a  per  cent  of  total expenditure of the union, has continuously improved since FY21.

<!-- image -->

1.45  During April - November 2024 (Chart I.36 below), three major facts stand out in union finances. First, following an unprecedented expansion of capital expenditure in the last four years, it remained subdued during Q1 FY25, owing to general elections. However, it rebounded after July despite a reduction in non-debt receipts owing to an increase in the devolution of taxes to states. Until November 2024, defence, railways and road transport accounted for about 75 per cent of the capital expenditure, whereas significant YoY growth occurred in power and food and public distribution. Second, despite the gross tax revenue (GTR)  increasing  by  10.7  per  cent  YoY  during  April-November  2024,  the  tax  revenue retained by the Union, net of devolution to the states, hardly increased. This was because of increased tax devolution, which helped the states to manage their expenditures smoothly. Thirdly, as of November, the deficit indicators of the union were comfortably placed, leaving ample room for developmental and capital expenditure in the rest of the year.

## Varying patterns in state finances

1.46  A  review  of  preliminary  unaudited  estimates  of  27  states 23 for  the  period  April  November 2024 24  corroborates the second point above (Chart I.37). The GTR of the union and own tax revenue (OTR) of the states have increased at comparable pace during this period. However, the overall tax revenue position of the state governments appears better as of November, because of increased tax devolution by the union. Among the state-specific taxes, stamps and registration, sales tax, state excise duties, and other taxes and duties registered positive growth, whereas land revenue 25 declined, for states as a collective (Chart I.38).

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; 1.47  For 15 states 28 , OTR accounted for more than half of their total tax receipts (Chart I.39), the highest being Telangana at 88 per cent, followed by Karnataka and Haryana at 86 per cent each. Further, states with a higher ratio of own revenue receipts (ORR) to total revenue receipts also tended to have relatively lower ratios of revenue deficit to total revenue receipts (Chart I.40).

23 Andhra  Pradesh  (AP),  Arunachal  Pradesh  (AR),  Assam  (AS),  Bihar  (BR),  Chhattisgarh  (CG),  Gujarat  (GJ), Haryana (HR), Himachal Pradesh (HP), Jharkhand (JH), Karnataka (KA), Kerala (KL), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Maharashtra (MH), Manipur (MN), Meghalaya (ML), Mizoram (MZ), Nagaland (NL), Odisha (OD), Punjab (PB), Rajasthan (RJ), Sikkim (SK), Tamil Nadu (TN), Telangana (TS), Tripura (TR), Uttar Pradesh (UP), Uttarakhand (UK) and West Bengal (WB).

1.48 For 23 States 29 , GST was the main source of revenue amongst ORR with the greatest reliance thereon by Manipur and Nagaland at 78 per cent and 72 per cent, respectively (Chart I.41). States garnering the highest shares in respective ORRs w.r.t. stamps &amp; registration, sales tax and state excise duties were Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, respectively. Odisha exhibited the highest share of non-tax revenue in ORR at 49 per cent.

<!-- image -->

1.49 The revenue expenditure of the states grew at 12 per cent (YoY) during April to November 2024 (Chart I.42), with subsidies and committed liabilities 30  registering a growth of 25.7 per cent and 10.4 per cent, respectively (Chart I.43). With expenditure on capital account for states declining by 5.6 per cent, total expenditure grew by 9.5 per cent. However, 11 states witnessed an increase in capex.

1.50 In the quality of expenditure, measured by capital outlay as a per cent of revenue expenditure over the five years ending FY24, states 31  exhibited considerable variation (Chart I.44).

## Inflation - a combination of low and stable core inflation with volatile food prices

1.52  Retail headline inflation, as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has softened from 5.4 per cent in FY24 to 4.9 per cent in April - December 2024. The decline is attributed to a 0.9 percentage point reduction in core (non-food, nonfuel) inflation between FY24 and April - December 2024. While the average inflation in  FY25  has  trended  downward,  monthly  volatility  in  food  prices  and  a  select  few commodities have been responsible for CPI inflation printing towards the upper side of the tolerance band of 4 (+/-) 2 per cent.

1.53  Pressures in food prices have been driven by factors such as supply chain disruptions and vagaries in weather conditions. Food inflation, measured by the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI), has increased from 7.5 per cent in FY24 to 8.4 per cent in FY25 (April-December), primarily driven by a few food items such as vegetables and pulses. Chart I.47 plots headline retail inflation excluding the following commodities - tomato, onion and potato, (TOP). These commodities together constitute 2.2 per cent of the CPI basket.

## External  sector  stability  safeguarded  by  services  trade  and  record remittances

1.54 India's  external  sector  displayed  mixed  trends,  primarily  due  to  volatile  global conditions.  A  decline  in  commodity  prices  affected  India's  merchandise  exports through the petroleum goods channel. Data on merchandise trade shows that India's merchandise exports grew by 1.6 per cent YoY in April - December 2024. 33  However, non-petroleum exports (on the same comparison basis) were up by 7.1 per cent. Nonpetroleum  and  non-gems  and  jewellery  exports  rose  by  9.1  per  cent.  Merchandise imports rose by 5.2 per cent. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in nonoil, non-gold imports. Gold imports also grew, influenced by higher global prices, early purchases ahead of festive spending, and demand for safe-haven assets.

1.55  While the outpacing of merchandise imports over merchandise exports widened India's merchandise trade deficit, India's services trade surplus has lent balance to the overall trade deficit. India's robust services exports have propelled the country to secure the seventh-largest share in global services exports, underscoring its competitiveness

32 Further, if gold and silver are also excluded, CPI inflation excluding these five commodities (which constitute 3.4 per cent of the CPI basket) is even lower.

in this critical sector. In addition to the services trade surplus, remittances from abroad led to a healthy net inflow of private transfers. As per the World Bank, India was the top recipient of remittances in the world, driven by an uptick in job creation in OECD economies. 34  These two factors combined to ensure that India's current account deficit (CAD) remains relatively contained at 1.2 per cent of GDP in Q2 FY25.

<!-- image -->

1.56 Comfortable financing of the CAD by the capital account has ensured external sector  stability.  Within  capital  flows,  gross  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  inflows increased 17.9 per cent YoY in April - November 2024. Gross FDI inflows during April - November in FY25 are higher than the levels witnessed in the corresponding period of any previous years except FY21. Net FDI inflow declined over this period, primarily on account of the uptick in repatriation, which is higher by 33.2 per cent YoY after a  growth of  51.5  per  cent  in  FY24.  The  rise  in  repatriation  through  the  channels  of secondary sales and Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) by multinational companies amid strong stock market performance points to investor confidence in profitable exits for direct investors. 35

1.57  On  the  other  hand,  foreign  portfolio  investment  (FPI)  flows  have  been  volatile in the second half of 2024, primarily on account of global geopolitical and monetary policy developments. Net FPI inflows slowed to USD 10.6 billion in April - December 2024 from USD 31.7 billion during the same period the previous year. The inclusion of India's sovereign government securities (G-secs) of certain tenors in the JP Morgan EM Bond Index induced heightened activity within the debt segment of the FPIs. Further elucidation of the impact of the inclusion of Indian G-secs in global bond indices can be seen in Chapter 3.

1.58 As a result of stable capital flows, India's foreign exchange reserves increased from USD 616.7 billion at the end of January 2024 to USD 704.9 billion in September 2024 before moderating to USD 634.6 billion as on 3 January 2025. India's forex reserves are sufficient to cover 90 per cent of external debt and provide an import cover of more than ten months, thereby safeguarding against external vulnerabilities.

1.59 Looking ahead, global policy changes could influence India's external trade. The evolving trade stance of a few major economies could affect key Indian export sectors such as chemicals, machinery, textiles, and electronics. In the short term, diversifying export  markets  is  essential,  while  medium-term  efforts  should  focus  on  increasing market  share.  Over  the  long  term,  India  must  position  itself  as  a  strategic  partner in  high-value  sectors  like  biotechnology  and  semiconductors.  Strategic  technology partnerships provide opportunities for enhanced cooperation in key areas like space, semiconductors, quantum technologies and advanced telecommunications.

## Financial  sector  prospects  amid  a  moderation  of  growth  in  credit disbursal

1.60 The banking and financial sector remains stable and well-capitalised, and is catering to the financing needs of the economy. While credit disbursal by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) is growing in double-digits, there has been a moderation in the growth in recent months. This is on the back of a high base and also due to regulatory tightening in sectors where high growth was observed. In view of high growth in certain components of  consumer credit, the RBI had, on 16th November 2023 36 , raised the risk weights on unsecured retail loans by 25 basis points. However, expansion in the segment continues to be broad-based, with housing loans as the major contributor. Apart from personal loans, credit to the services sector is the other major driver of expansion in gross bank credit. Industrial credit growth is picking up but remains below growth rates in other major sectors.

1.61  Stability  in  the  banking  sector  is  underscored  by  declining  asset  impairments, robust capital buffers, and strong operational performance. As per the RBI's Financial Stability  Report  (FSR),  December  2024 37 ,  the  gross  non-performing  assets  (NPAs) in  the  banking system have declined to a 12-year low of 2.6 per cent of gross loans and  advances.  The  capital-to-risk-weighted  assets  ratio  (CRAR)  for  SCBs  stands  at 16.7 per cent as of September 2024, well above the norm. The profitability of SCBs improved during H1 FY25, with profit after tax (PAT) surging by 22.2 per cent YoY, while the Return on Equity (RoE) and Return on Assets (RoA) have improved on a YoY basis. Macro stress tests suggest that banks' overall capital levels would stay above the regulatory minimum even in adverse scenarios.

1.62 While  the  long-term  stability  of  the  banking  system  is  safeguarded,  there  was scrutiny  over  the  short-term  dynamics  emerging  from  the  mismatch  of  credit  and deposit growth rates. The RBI FSR's (June 2024) 38  analysis of previous episodes where credit growth outpaced deposit growth shows that the average duration of such cycles where credit growth exceeds deposit growth is 41 months. The merger of a bank with a  non-bank has elongated the cycle in this episode. The analysis reveals that credit growth precedes deposit growth and that convergence is usually achieved through a fall in credit growth.

1.63 Another area of concern within the banking system is the stress on unsecured credit,  i.e.,  personal  loans  and  credit  cards.  As  of  September  2024,  51.9  per  cent  of the fresh addition to the stock of NPAs in the retail loan portfolio emanated from the slippages in the unsecured loan book. 39  The RBI FSR (December 2024) notes that nearly half of borrowers with credit card and personal loans also have another active retail loan, often substantial, such as a housing or vehicle loan. When a borrower defaults on any loan category, financial institutions classify all loans of that borrower as nonperforming. Hence, their larger, secured loans face delinquency risks due to defaults in smaller personal loans.

1.64 Apart from active monitoring of the banking system, there is a need to be cautious regarding  developments  in  the  Indian  and  global  stock  markets.  While  the  Indian financial  sector  shows  resilience,  international  market  conditions  may  have  some influence  on  India.  Any  correction  in  the  US  stock  market  could  have  implications for global markets (See Box II.2 of the Survey for an analysis pertaining to the Indian market).

## Employment trends

1.65 India's labour market growth in recent years has been supported by post-pandemic recovery and increased formalisation. As per the 2023-24 annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) report, the unemployment rate for individuals aged 15 years and above has steadily declined from 6 per cent in 2017-18 to 3.2 per cent in 2023-24. The labour force participation rate (LFPR) and the worker-to-population ratio (WPR) have also increased (Chart I.52). In Q2 FY25, the urban unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and above improved slightly to 6.4 per cent compared to 6.6 per cent in Q2 FY24. Both LFPR and WPR also increased during this period.

1.66 The  formal  sector  in  India  has  seen  significant  growth,  with  net  Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) subscriptions more than doubling from 61 lakh in FY19 to 131 lakh in FY24. In April  -November 2024, net additions reached 95.6 lakh, driven largely by youth. Workers aged 18-25 years contributed to 47 per cent of the net payroll additions. This indicates a growing trend towards formal employment, which enhances workers' access to social security and stability. Government initiatives are playing a key role in enhancing the formalisation of the job market.

1.67  Technological developments over recent years have generated much discussion on the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on India's labour market. The integration of  AI  into  India's  labour  market  presents  an  opportunity  to  enhance  productivity, elevate workforce quality and create employment, provided, systemic challenges are effectively addressed through robust institutional frameworks. For India, a servicesdriven economy with a youthful and adaptable workforce, the adoption of AI offers

the  potential  to  support  economic  growth  and  improve  labour  market  outcomes. Prioritising education and skill development will be crucial to equipping workers with the competencies needed to thrive in an AI-augmented landscape. By capitalising on the global infancy of AI, India has the opportunity to prepare its labour force for a future defined by collaboration between human and machine intelligence. An elucidation of these dynamics can be found in Chapter 13.
