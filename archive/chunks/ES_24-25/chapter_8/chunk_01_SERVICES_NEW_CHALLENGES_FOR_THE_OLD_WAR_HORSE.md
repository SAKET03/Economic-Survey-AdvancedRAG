The  service  sector  has  been  fuelling  growth  both  domestically  and  globally. In  FY25  so  far,  services  propped  up  GDP  growth  when  manufacturing  has been  affected  by  dampening  global  merchandise  trade.  The  critical  role  of services exports in strengthening India's external balance and the increasing 'servicification'  of  the  industrial  sector  adds  to  its  importance  to  the  Indian economy. Logistics services have regained their pre-pandemic momentum and are enhancing the user experience through digitisation. India continues to be an important partner in the changing global technology landscape through the adoption of digital technologies in business processes. Initiatives such as Open Network  for  Digital  Commerce  (ONDC)  are  making  these  transformations more inclusive. Equipping the labour force with requisite skills and creating an enabling environment through simple and transparent processes of grassroots level governance will go a long way in realising the full potential of commercial services and building resilience to global headwinds.
