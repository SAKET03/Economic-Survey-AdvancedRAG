# State Wise Analysis of Service Sector Performance

STATE WISE ANALYSIS OF SERVICE SECTOR PERFORMANCE

8.35   The context for presenting the state-specific patterns in industrial and service gross state value added (GSVA) 19   has been mentioned in Chapter 7 of this Survey. The service sector accounts for about 55 per cent of the national GVA in FY25. However, the  distribution  of  service  sector  activity  across  Indian  states  reveals  a  pronounced geographic dispersion. For FY23, Karnataka and Maharashtra account for more than one fourth of the total service sector GSVA of all the states. These states along with Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat together share more than 50 per cent of the total service sector GSVA. These states also have more than 50 per cent of the total industrial GSVA, suggesting that both feed into each other. On the other hand, another set of  19 states collectively account for only one fourth of the service sector GSVA of all the states (Chart VIII.21).

8.36  Among the different service activities, public administration is a unique category that reflects the strength of the state machinery in the state. This is majorly determined by the strength of state's own revenues, central transfers including tax devolution and

19    In this chapter, service sector gross state value added (GSVA) refers to FY23 and it is taken at constant prices (2011-12). These GSVA numbers are estimated by the respective State Directorates of Economics &amp; Statistics and hosted by MoSPI. The aggregate of state GSVA may differ from the national GVA estimated by MoSPI. State population, wherever used, refers to figures of the respective state governments for their GSDP calculations.

borrowing of the state, which together define the spending capacity of the state. This is independent of other services which are largely commercially driven.

8.37  The economies of many north eastern states have considerable dependence on the resources of the state and central government because there are natural disadvantages to those regions to pursue large-scale industrialisation and commercial services. (Chart VIII.22)

8.38  There are four different scenarios in the relationship between services share in total GSVA (defined as service intensity of the state economy), and, services GSVA per capita.

GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;

- i.  low service intensity, low per capita service GSVA;
- ii.  low service intensity, high per capita service GSVA;
- iii.  high service intensity, low per capita service GSVA; and,
- iv.  high service intensity, high per capita service GSVA.

8.39   Category  (ii)  above  indicates  that  the  productivity  of  commercial  services  is high.  In  contrast,  category  (iii)  represents  high  dependence  on  commercial  service activities without their being productive enough to generate high levels of income. Firm conclusions cannot be drawn from states falling in the other two categories without analysing supplementary information. However, in category (iv), some state patterns are  very  clear-Karnataka's,  and  to  an  extent,  Telangana's  positions  are  majorly explained by the large presence of IT services, Maharashtra's position is largely due to its strength of financial intermediation activities, and, Kerala's position mainly because of the strong presence of trade, financial and real estate services. The following three charts present service activities that constitute more than two-thirds of the total services GSVA net of public administration. These three charts provide some explanation for the patterns seen in Chart VIII.23.

8.40   The states like Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, and Mizoram have more than a third of their services GSVA coming from trade, repair, hotels, and restaurants, partly because of  tourism. Many bigger states have trade and repair intensity of close to or higher than the national average indicating a large presence of low value adding trade in these states. Many of these states are relatively less industrialised also (Refer Chapter 7).

8.41     Financial,  real  estate  and  professional  services  have  very  high  levels  of  concentration in a few states. Within the service sector, financial services are highly concentrated with Maharashtra (Mumbai), Tamil Nadu, Gujarat (GIFT City) and Karnataka accounting for more than 50 per cent of total financial services GSVA.  (Maharashtra is not presented in the chart because it is a big positive outlier).

8.42   Karnataka,  Maharashtra,  Telangana,  Haryana,  Tamil  Nadu  have  more  than one  third  of  their  services  GSVA  coming  from  real  estate,  ownership  of  dwelling  &amp; professional services. (Karnataka is not presented in the chart because it is a positive outlier). Karnataka (Bengaluru), Telangana (Hyderabad) and Maharashtra (Mumbai), Haryana (Gurugram) and Tamil Nadu (Chennai) have concentration of IT and fintech services leading to high demand for office and residential space.

8.43  Chart VIII.27 combines the state patterns flowing from this chapter and chapter 7. (Sikkim and Goa are not presented here because they are outliers). It largely indicates the comparative advantages of different states.

8.44   On  the  basis  of  the  above  analysis,  states  can  be  classified  into  four  distinct categories based on their service and industrial performance in terms of per capita GSVA.

- i. States  with  high  per  capita  industrial  GSVA:  These  are  states  like  Gujarat, Uttarakhand,  and  Himachal  Pradesh.  States  like  Chhattisgarh  and  Odisha perform reasonably well in the industrial sector while they have low service sector presence. This indicates that these states will stand to gain largely by accelerating their industrialisation and industrial productivity which will strengthen their  service  sectors  through  the  ongoing  trends  in  greater  'servicification'  of industries. 20
- ii. Strong  service  sector  performers:  States  such  as  Karnataka,  Telangana  and Kerala excel in services, with high per-capita service GSVA and service shares in GSVA but exhibit only around average industrial per capita GSVA. These regions largely depend on urbanised service-driven economies.
- iii.    Dual strengths-industrial and service: Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu typically represent  states  with  reasonably  strong  industrial  and  service  sectors.  Their diversified  economies  integrate  manufacturing  with  trade,  financial  services, real estate &amp; professional services.
- iv. States  with  reform  potential:  While  the  need  for  business  reforms  cuts  across  states in general, the fourth category specifically includes states that have significant potential for reform led development. These states are Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh,  Jharkhand,  Madhya  Pradesh,  Manipur,  Meghalaya,  Nagaland, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

8.45  As per DPIIT's Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP) 21 , which ranks states based on their performance in introducing business reforms, the states with service intensity backed by industry are the states which have introduced larger numbers of reforms in comparison to their peer states and fall in top achiever and achiever's category. Thus, introducing business reforms is essential to industrial as well as service development in the state.

8.46  As per annual survey of unincorporated sector enterprises 2022-23, the number of estimated enterprises belonging to the unincorporated sector stands at 6.5 crore. 72.6 per cent of these enterprises operate in the service sector. Many states like Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal have a substantial presence of these enterprises. These enterprises, though contributing to the overall development of the economy in terms of employment and income, are losing out on benefits normally offered by incorporation such as tax benefits, and credibility which could help them build better client relationships, access

to credit and durability which would help them provide continuity to their business operations  etc.  States,  through  policy  nudges  reducing  compliance  difficulties,  can accelerate the incorporation of these enterprises.
