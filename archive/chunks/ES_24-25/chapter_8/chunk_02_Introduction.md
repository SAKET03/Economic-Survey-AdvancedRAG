8.1 Services value added accounts for about 62 per cent of the global GDP 1 . Services have been the growth engine for middle-income countries like China, Thailand, and India in the last decade. Presently, the Euro area is reeling under a slowdown but is expected  to  improve  in  2025  on  the  back  of  improving  services  activity.  However, higher  nominal  wage  growth  compared  to  pre-pandemic  wage  growth  has  kept service inflation high. This has caused the current cycle of global disinflation to slow down 2 .

8.2 The Global Services PMI Business Activity Index rose to a four month high of 53.8 in  December  2024.  This  signals  expansion  for  the  twenty-third  consecutive  month.

8.3 India's  share  in  global  services  exports  has  been  steadily  rising  for  the  last two  decades.  This  has  helped  compensate  the  impact  of  oscillation  in  the  share  of merchandise exports in global merchandise exports to some extent. In 2023, the United States led global services exports with a dominant 13 per cent share, followed by the United Kingdom with 7.4 per cent, Germany with 5.5 per cent and Ireland, China, and France, each accounting for approximately 5 per cent. India ranks seventh globally, representing a 4.3 per cent share in the global services export.
