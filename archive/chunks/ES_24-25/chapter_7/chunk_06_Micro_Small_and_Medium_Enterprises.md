MICRO SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (MSME)

7.36  The MSME sector is important to India's progress. By fostering entrepreneurship and creating a large number of jobs at relatively low capital costs, the sector plays a crucial role, second only to agriculture. As of November 26, 2024, MSMEs have reported employing 23.24 crore individuals.

7.37   In  order  to  simplify  the  process  of  registering  MSMEs  and  to  enable  ease  of doing business the government launched the Udyam Registration Portal in July 2020. This  online,  self-declaration-based  system  requires  a  PAN  card  for  registration.  To formalize Informal Micro Enterprises (IMEs), the government in collaboration with SIDBI, introduced the Udyam Assist Platform (UAP) in January 2023. Over 2.39 crore informal micro enterprises have been formalized through the platform, making them eligible for priority sector lending benefits.

7.38  To facilitate credit to MSMEs, a revamp of the Credit Guarantee Scheme for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) was undertaken with ₹9,000 crore in the corpus of the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for MSEs. This aimed to facilitate an additional ₹2 lakh crore credit for MSEs at reduced interest rates. Consequent to this, the credit limit for guarantee coverage under the scheme was enhanced from ₹2 crore to ₹5 crore, and the annual guarantee fees across all segments were reduced by 50 per cent. In FY23, 11.65  lakh  guarantees  amounting to ₹1 lakh crore were given. The government also made special provisions for IMEs under the existing credit guarantee to avail credit easily.

## BOX VII.4: TReDS: Transforming MSME Financing Through Timely Payments

The  launch  of  TReDS  has  been  an  important  step  taken  by  Government  of  India  for benefitting the MSMEs and helping them realize their receivables in a time-bound manner at  a  relatively  lower  financing  cost.  TReDS,  regulated  by  the  RBI,  is  a  marketplace  that enables buyers such as government departments, public sector undertakings, corporates etc. to honour timely payments to their MSME suppliers as per MSMED Act 2006.

TReDS 27   offers  several  notable  benefits  for  MSMEs,  including  post-shipment  financing without  recourse,  which  is  based  on  the  buyer's  creditworthiness.  The  platform  employs an auction-based mechanism that ensures competitive rates from financiers. Further, the seamless digital financing and settlement process, enabled through the National Payments Corporation of India, enhances efficiency and transparency in transactions.The Governments of Goa and Tamil Nadu have set an example by adopting the TReDS platform to ensure timely

payments to their MSME suppliers. Goa, heavily reliant on tourism, leveraged TReDS during the  COVID-19 disruption to enhance supplier liquidity, facilitating payments for over 250 MSMEs since October 2020, with invoice discounts. Tamil Nadu joined TReDS in 2022 under the Raising and Accelerating MSME Performance (RAMP) program, supporting MSMEs in significant numbers. Their proactive adoption has inspired other states to follow suit.

Several  central  public  sector  enterprises  and  government  entities  have  been  using  the TReDS platform since its inception to facilitate timely payments to MSME suppliers. Active participants like BHEL, NTPC, ONGC, BPCL, HPCL, IOCL and others help MSMEs maintain their working capital cycles while enabling them to benefit from lower interest rates.

In addition to CPSEs, corporates with a turnover exceeding ₹500 crore have been utilising TReDS for prompt payments to their suppliers. With the Government of India's mandate for companies with a turnover above ₹250 crore to join the platform, more corporates are expected to onboard. TReDS also fosters strong relationships between corporates and their suppliers by ensuring swift payments, eliminating the need for MSMEs to chase their buyers for payments. If more government bodies, ministries, state governments, and corporates adopt receivables discounting on platforms like TReDS, it could significantly transform the MSME financing landscape.

7.39  To provide equity funding to MSMEs with the potential to scale up, the government launched the Self-Reliant India (SRI) Fund with a corpus of ₹50,000 crore.  The fund has a provision of ₹10,000 crore from the government and ₹40,000 crore through private equity/venture capital funds. In addition to providing easy credit, the government is committed to addressing MSMEs' issues through measures like MSME Samadhan and the  CHAMPIONS  (Creation  and  Harmonious  Application  of  Modern  Processes  for Increasing the Output and National Strength) portal.

7.40   To  deal  with  the  issues  of  delayed  payments,  MSE  suppliers  may  approach  the Micro  and  Small  Enterprises  Facilitation  Council  (MSEFC).  The  government  also launched a portal that gives information about individual CPSEs, central ministries, state governments, and other buyers regarding the payments pending with them in respect of  the  MSEs.  The  portal  also  facilitates  MSEs  to  file  their  delayed  payment-related complaints online. From the date of launch of the MSME SAMADHAAN portal 2,20,704 applications have been filed by MSEs, out of which 20652 have been mutually settled, 53493 are yet to be viewed by MSEFC, 60714 have been rejected, 45952 cases have been disposed off and 39893 cases are under consideration. 28  As of date, the CHAMPIONS portal disseminates information in eleven regional languages.

7.41    The  government  is  implementing  the  Micro  and  Small  Enterprises-Cluster Development Programme (MSE-CDP) to develop clusters across the country. Under this, Common Facility Centres (CFCs) are channels to address common issues, such as improvement of technology, skills, quality, etc., for MSEs. As per the report of the evaluation  study  of  MSE-CDP  conducted  by  the  National  Productivity  Council,  the

scheme has been able to improve the efficiency of the value chain of the units in the cluster, resulting in overall productivity growth of around 10-15 per cent and growth in turnover in the range of 20-30 per cent 29 .
