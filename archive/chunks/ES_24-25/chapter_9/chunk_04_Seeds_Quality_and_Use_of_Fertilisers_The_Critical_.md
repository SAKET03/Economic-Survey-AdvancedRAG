# Seeds-Quality and Use of Fertilisers: The Critical Differentiator

SEEDS-QUALITY AND USE OF FERTILISERS: The Critical Differentiator

9.12 The adage 'As you sow, so shall you reap' effectively reflects the significance of seed quality and the accessibility of seeds in sufficient quantities by farmers in promoting healthy crop growth. In the 2023-24 season, ICAR produced 1.06 lakh quintals of breeder seeds encompassing 1,798 varieties across 81 crops for further multiplication. Given the impact of weather on agricultural output, research into climate-resistant seeds has become a priority, with 2,177 of the 2,593 new varieties released since 2014 specifically addressing this challenge. To ensure that these varieties are readily available, seed banks have been established. In regions such as north-western India, heat-tolerant wheat varieties have seen widespread adoption to alleviate the effects of heat stress. In FY24, demonstrations of climate-resilient technology packages were conducted in 121 vulnerable districts under the National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture initiative.

9.13 Soil  degradation,  particularly  the  decline  in  organic  carbon  content,  poses a  significant  challenge  to  Indian  agriculture.  Many  soils  in  India  are  deficient  in organic  carbon,  macronutrients,  and  essential  micronutrients  such  as  boron,  iron, and sulphur. This deterioration of soil health adversely affects fertility, productivity, and overall agricultural sustainability. To achieve optimal crop yields while ensuring environmental  sustainability,  it  is  imperative  to  use  fertilisers  judiciously.  Recently introduced, 'Urea Gold' combines urea with sulphur, minimizing wastage and enhancing plant nutrient uptake. Additionally, the use of drones and fertigation 12   techniques are being implemented to optimize fertiliser applications. The Programme for Restoration, Awareness  Generation,  Nourishment,  and  Amelioration  of  Mother  Earth  (PMPRANAM) initiative incentivises states to adopt alternative fertilisers  such  as  Nano Urea, Nano Diammonium phosphate (DAP), and organic fertilisers. By promoting these sustainable options, the government aims to improve soil health, reduce environmental pollution, and boost agricultural productivity.
