FOOD PROCESSING INDUSTRIES: Critical for the Economy

9.49 The food processing industry in India is one of the largest  employers  within organised  manufacturing,  accounting  for  12.41  per  cent  of  total  employment  in  the organised sector. In the fiscal year FY24, the value of agri-food exports, which includes processed food exports, reached USD 46.44 billion, constituting roughly 11.7 per cent of India's total exports. Notably, the share of processed food exports within agri-food exports has risen from 14.9 per cent in FY18 to 23.4 per cent in FY24.

9.50 To  foster  growth  in  the  food  processing  sector,  the  Indian  government  has initiated several key programs, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY). This scheme focuses on developing modern infrastructure and optimising supply  chains  from  farm  to  retail.  By  minimising  post-harvest  losses,  increasing processing  capabilities,  and  enhancing  export  levels,  PMKSY  aims  to  promote  the overall  advancement  of  the  food  processing  industry.  As  of  31  October  2024,  1,079 PMKSY projects have been completed.

9.51 The  Production  Linked  Incentive  Scheme  for  Food  Processing  (PLISFPI), launched in 2021, seeks to cultivate globally competitive food processing leaders by facilitating branding and marketing initiatives in international markets. By 31 October 2024,  171  applications  had  been  approved  under  this  scheme,  with  beneficiaries investing ₹8,910 crore and receiving ₹1,084.01 crore in incentives.

9.52 Furthermore, to provide comprehensive support-including technical, financial, and business assistance for establishing or upgrading micro food processing enterprises-the Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME)  scheme  was  launched  in  2020.  As  of  31  October  2024,  the  scheme  has received 407,819 applications, with loans totalling ₹8.63 thousand crore sanctioned to 108,580 applicants. Additionally, the programme has successfully trained 672 Master Trainers, 1,120 District Level Trainers, and 87,477 beneficiaries across 36 states and union territories.
