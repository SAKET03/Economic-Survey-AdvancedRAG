CLIMATE ACTION IN AGRICULTURE

9.37 The NMSA is recognised as one of the nine missions within the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). The NMSA has identified key climate adaptation strategies, including enhancing water efficiency, managing soil health and nutrients, providing crop insurance, offering credit support, strengthening value chains, delivering  agro-advisories,  promoting  farm  mechanisation,  managing  agricultural waste,  developing  integrated  farming  systems,  and  supporting  organic  and  natural farming  practices.  It  also  emphasises  climate-resilient  varieties,  livestock,  and  fish culture, promoting these initiatives through various government schemes.

9.38 To support organic farming, the government has implemented two dedicated schemes since 2015: the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and the Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER). Under PKVY,  52,289  clusters  covering  14.99  lakh  hectares  and  25.30  lakh  farmers  have been  mobilised.  Similarly,  under  MOVCDNER,  434  Farmer  Producer  Companies have been created, covering a total area of 1.73 lakh hectares and benefiting 2.19 lakh farmers.

## BOX IX.7 : Spatial mapping of agricultural sustainability

A Composite Index of Agricultural Sustainability was calculated by ICAR using 51 indicators related to environmental health, soil and water quality, and socioeconomic development. The  average  estimated  value  of  the  Index  is  0.49,  suggesting  that  Indian  agriculture  is moderately sustainable. States like  Mizoram, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, West Bengal, and Uttarakhand perform better than the national average.

In  contrast,  arid  Rajasthan  has  the  least  sustainable  agricultural  practices.  According to  the  report,  the  states  with  higher  sustainability  scores  have  experienced  sizable  crop diversification,  improvement  in  agriculture  infrastructure,  farm  credit  and  sustainable input usage. States in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, and Haryana, as well as rice-dominant states like Jharkhand and Assam, are at a higher risk of climate change impacts.
