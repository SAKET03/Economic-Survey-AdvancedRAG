SPACE INFRASTRUCTURE

6.43 India  currently  operates  56  active  space  assets,  including  19  communication satellites, nine navigation satellites, four scientific satellites, and 24 earth observation satellites. ISRO has enhanced its capabilities by adding a small satellite launch vehicle to its fleet. New Space India Limited (NSIL) successfully fulfilled its contract to launch 72 OneWeb satellites into low earth orbit.  Recently it also launched the GSAT-20 satellite in collaboration with SpaceX. Various initiatives by the government in the domain of space-based infrastructure are given in Box VI.14.

## Box VI.14: Space-based infrastructure monitoring platforms

ISRO's advanced geospatial platforms are playing a pivotal role in infrastructure monitoring and management. These initiatives support a range of projects, from rural development and electrical infrastructure to judicial and urban planning, enhancing efficiency and tracking progress.

- ISRO's  Bhuvan  Platform: supports  infrastructure  monitoring  under  schemes  like MGNREGA and the watershed component of PMKSY at different stages of implementation.
- Electrical  infrastructure  management: Bhuvan  facilitates  the  management  of electrical infrastructure in Maharashtra and Telangana through Web-GIS portals.
- NyayaVikas Portal for judicial infrastructure: Developed in collaboration with the Department of Justice, this portal monitors 2,840 judicial projects using Web GIS and mobile geotagging, with over 7,900 geotags created to track progress.
- Urban geospatial databases for AMRUT Cities: ISRO has created large-scale 2D urban  geospatial  databases  for  238  AMRUT  cities,  assisting  in  developing  GIS-based master plans for urban planning.

6.44 As  part  of  India's  Space  Vision  2047,  the  Union  Cabinet  has  approved  four key  projects:  the  Gaganyaan  follow-on  mission,  which  will  pave  the  way  for  the establishment of the first module of the Bhartiya Antariksh Station; the Chandrayaan-4 Lunar Sample Return Mission; the Venus Orbiter Mission; and the development of the Next Generation Launch Vehicle. These initiatives aim to enhance India's technological capabilities,  foster  industry  collaboration,  and  strengthen  the  country's  position  in global space exploration.
