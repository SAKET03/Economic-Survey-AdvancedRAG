## Rural Drinking Water and Sanitation

6.28 The Jal Jeevan Mission (JJM) aims to ensure long-term water security for rural households  by  providing  reliable  access  to  safe  piped  drinking  water.  When  it  was launched in August 2019, only 3.23 crore (17 per cent) of rural households had tap water connections. Since then, over 12.06 crore families have been added, increasing the total to more than 15.30 crore (79.1 per cent) out of approximately 19.34 crore rural households as of November 26, 2024. Eight states, namely, Arunachal Pradesh, Goa, Haryana,  Himachal  Pradesh,  Gujarat,  Punjab,  Telangana  and  Mizoram,  and  three union territories, namely, Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands, Dadra Nagar Haveli &amp; Daman Diu and Puducherry have achieved 100 per cent coverage. There are 2,160 water quality laboratories, 1,570 of which are accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories, ensuring the safety of drinking water.

## Box VI.11: Impact of Jal Jeevan Mission

The mission improved access to safe drinking water in rural areas, particularly in regions affected by water quality issues like arsenic and fluoride. Its impact includes better health outcomes and enhanced water security for vulnerable populations.

- Coverage of quality-affected Areas: At the time of the launch of JJM, out of 19.4 crore  rural  households,  over  75.2  lakh  households  lived  in  quality-affected  areas  that lacked  safe  drinking  water.  Since  its  implementation,  69.23  lakh  rural  households  in quality-affected areas are getting safe piped water supply.
- Arsenic-affected and fluoride-affected habitants: Arsenic-Affected and FluorideAffected  Habitants:  Safe  drinking  water  has  been  provided  to  more  than  23  lakh households in arsenic-affected habitations and 11.43 lakh households in fluoride-affected habitations.
- Community Water Purification Plants (CWPPs): 618 CWPPs have been installed under JJM, out of which 573 are installed in arsenic and fluoride-affected areas.

6.29 Swachh  Bharat  Mission-  Grameen  (SBM-G)  achieved  open  defecation-free (ODF) status in the first phase. Phase II of SBM-G is implemented from 2020-21 to 2024-25, with a focus on converting the villages from ODF to ODF Plus.  An ODF plus progress is captured in three categories 14  namely aspiring, rising and model. The goal of SBM-G Phase-II is to make all the villages ODF Plus, i.e. 'Model Category'. An ODF Plus village in the model category is one that is sustaining its ODF status, plus having arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, observing visual cleanliness (minimal  litter,  minimal  stagnant  wastewater  and  no  plastic  waste  dump  in  public places) and displaying ODF plus information, education and communication messages. During April to November 2024, 1.92 lakh villages were incrementally declared ODF Plus under the model category, taking the total number of ODF Plus villages to 3.64 lakh.

## Box VI.12:  Success stories of waste management initiatives

Model of sustainable development and community empowerment in Erattayar Gram Panchayat, Idukki, Kerala :

<!-- image -->

By focusing on waste management, the Panchayat preserves the environment and creates jobs,  particularly  for  women.  The  strategy  involves  door-to-door  collection,  resource recovery, and recycling, reaching over 4,600 households and 500 institutions. Around 30 women are employed, earning an average of ₹10,000 monthly.

Despite  initial  challenges  like  fee  collection  and  infrastructure  issues,  the  Panchayat's resilience has driven progress. With enhanced training and partnerships, waste management practices have improved. The Haritha Karma Sena, with 28 dedicated members, plays a crucial  role  in  this  effort,  collecting  user  fees  from  about  85  per  cent  of  households  and 90 per cent of institutions, generating approximately ₹2.5 lakh per month. Materials are meticulously segregated and sent to private agencies for further processing.

The Panchayat collects four tonnes of plastic and other non-biodegradable items monthly, adhering to a set schedule. This initiative not only fosters cleanliness but also empowers women, promoting inclusivity and gender equality. Erattayar Gram Panchayat's approach, emphasising  collaboration,  innovation,  and  empowerment,  sets  an  example  for  other communities striving for a greener, more equitable future.

## Transforming Waste into Wealth: NADEP Composting, Chhindwara, Madhya Pradesh

The Chhindwara district of Madhya  Pradesh has prioritised biodegradable waste management as part of SBM-G Phase 2, establishing waste management infrastructure in 784 Gram Panchayats and 1,898 villages, including 8,507 NADEP (a method of organic composting that produces fertiliser from organic materials) compost pits. However, due to improper usage of these pits as community dustbins, the district initiated a comprehensive Swachhata Drive from May 1 to June 30. This initiative focused on enhancing awareness and promoting sustainable practices among rural communities.

Community  engagement  and  capacity-building  programmes  were  instrumental  in  the initiative's  success.  Extensive  outreach  efforts  educated  community  members  about  the benefits  of  composting,  while  targeted  training  programmmes  equipped  farmers  and stakeholders with the knowledge to manage organic waste effectively. These efforts ensured the appropriate utilisation of cow dung and organic waste in NADEP pits, facilitating the production of high-quality compost.

The  initiative witnessed  active participation  of  approximately  68,050  stakeholders, including  farmers,  PRI  members,  Swachhagrahis,  SHGs,  and  community  members, fostering significant improvements in waste segregation and management across villages. Each NADEP pit is projected to yield 500 kg of compost per cycle, generating an estimated income  of  ₹30,000  annually  for  farmers  through  three  composting  cycles.  This  shift  is expected  to  reduce  dependency  on  chemical  fertilisers,  decrease  costs,  and  enhance  soil health, supporting sustainable agricultural practices. Future plans include expanding the deployment of NADEP pits, ensuring their optimal use, and establishing market linkages for compost.

6.33   Besides,  leveraging  ICT-enabled  tools  strengthened  the  mission  governance. The Swachhata App effectively allows citizens to report grievances, directing them to the relevant municipal corporation for resolution. With 2.08 crore users, the app has handled 2.55 crore complaints, resolving 2.39 crore. The Google toilet locator allows users to upload information about community and public toilets in their cities as 'SBM Toilet' on Google Maps and provide feedback. To date, 67,407 toilets across 3,326 cities are mapped on Google Maps, including those in hospitals, malls, bus stands, railway stations, metro stations, markets, and more.

6.34 Urban  housing: The  Pradhan  Mantri  Awas  Yojana  -  Urban  (PMAY-U), launched in 2015, aims to provide permanent housing in urban areas. As of November 25, 2024, a total of 1.18 crore houses have been sanctioned, with 1.14 crore grounded and over 89 lakh completed. PMAY-U 2.0 was launched in September 2024 to assist an additional one crore households. Currently, 29 states and union territories have signed agreements to implement PMAY-U 2.0, with approval having been granted for 6 lakh houses in FY25.

6.35 Urban transport: Metro rail and rapid rail transit systems are operational or under construction in 29 cities across India, with 1010 kilometres currently operational in 23 cities and an additional 980 kilometres underway. As of January 5, 2025, 62.7 kms were operationalised in FY25, and the daily ridership reached 10.2 million. These systems have led to considerable savings in emissions, time, vehicle operating costs, accidents and infrastructure maintenance.

## 6.36 Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation (AMRUT):

AMRUT scheme was launched in 2015 to focus on improving urban water management in 500 cities. As a result, tap water coverage has increased to 70 per cent, and sewerage coverage has risen to 62 per cent. The mission has created or augmented water treatment capacity of 4,649 million litres per day and developed 2,439 parks, adding 5,070 acres of green space. In 2021, AMRUT 2.0 was introduced to expand coverage to all statutory towns and cities, with an allocation of ₹2.77 lakh crore during FY22 to FY26. This phase so far has initiated 8,923 projects worth ₹1.89 lakh crore. AMRUT 2.0 actively involves self-help groups and promotes innovative technologies.

6.37 Smart Cities Mission: Launched in 2015, the mission aims to develop smart cities with essential infrastructure, good quality of life and a sustainable environment. As of 13 January 2025, 8,058 projects worth 1.64 lakh crore have been proposed, with 7,479 projects worth 1.50 lakh crore completed (Chart VI.20). Achievements under the mission are provided in Chart V1.21.
