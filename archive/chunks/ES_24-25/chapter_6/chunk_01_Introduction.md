6.1 India's development aspirations require a substantial investment in infrastructure over the next decade. While estimates of the required spending differ in scale 1,2,3, there is  general  agreement  that  current  infrastructure  spending  needs  to  be  increased  to achieve these objectives. Keeping this in view, the government has laid a special focus on infrastructure in the last five years. Reflecting this intent, the capital expenditure by the union government on major infrastructure sectors 4   has been increased at a trend rate of 38.8 per cent from FY20 to FY24.
