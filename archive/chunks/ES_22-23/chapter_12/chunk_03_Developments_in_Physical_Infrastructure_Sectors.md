## road transport: increased budgetary support by the government augmented road connectivity

- 12.39 Road infrastructure in the form of a network of national highways, state highways, district roads, rural roads, and urban roads acts as a major mode of transportation and connectivity for the country's diverse population of consumers and businesses. Roads supplement the other modes of transport through last-mile connectivity to the far-flung regions of the country.
- 12.40 There has been an increase in the construction of National Highways (NHs)/roads over time, with 10,457 km of roads constructed in FY22 as compared to 6,061 km in FY16. In FY23 (until October 2022), 4,060 km of NHs/roads were constructed, which was around 91 per cent of the achievement in the corresponding period of the previous financial year. Total budgetary support for investment in the sector has been increasing rapidly in the last four years and stood at around ₹1.4 lakh crore during FY23 (as of 31 October 2022).

12.41 In  line  with  the  vision  of  monetisation  of  public  sector  assets,  National  Highways Authority of India (NHAI) launched its InvIT in FY22 not only to facilitate monetisation of roads but also to attract foreign and domestic institutional investors to invest in the roads sector. So far, NHAI InvIT has raised more than ₹10,200 crore from high quality foreign and Indian institutional investors (up to December 2022).

## railways: expansion and modernisation, a continuous process

12.42 A major transport infrastructure, that can very well be called India's lifeline, and which had a huge role to play in national integration and regional development, is the railways. The Indian Railways (IR), with over 68,031 route kms, is the fourth largest network in the world under single management. Passenger traffic originating in IR was 809 crore during pre-Covid-19 period (2019-20), but dipped to 125 crore in 2020-21. It has since recovered to 351.9 crore in 2021-22. During the current financial year, passenger traffic has seen further strong growth with the number of originating passengers already hitting 418.4 crore (up to November 2022). Enhanced mobility across the country and demand for faster and competitive trains will assist the growth in passenger traffic in the coming years.

12.43 In the case of revenue-earning, freight traffic was sustained by IR despite the Covid-19 shock. Between FY20-21 and FY21-22, there was a sharp increase in the freight traffic, reflecting the strong revival in the economic activity in the domestic economy. During FY22-23 (up to November 2022), Indian Railways (IR) carried 976.8 million tonnes of revenue-earning freight

traffic (excluding KRCL 11 ), as against 901.7 million tonnes during the corresponding period in FY21-22 (excluding KRCL), which translated into an increase of 8.3 per cent.

12.44 The capital expenditure (Capex) on infrastructure in railways has received tremendous boost since 2014. It has seen a continuous increase in the last four years with Capex (B.E.) of ₹2.5 lakh crore in FY23, up by around 29 per cent compared to the previous year. During the current financial year (till 12 December 2022), IR has already completed 2022 Track Kilometres (TKM) which includes 109 TKM of New Line, 102 TKM of Gauge Conversion and 1811 TKM of multi-tracking  projects.  To  understand  the  pace  of  progress,  it  may  be  noted  that  during  last financial year this figure was reached only during the first week of March. From FY2014-22, across IR, 20,628 km sections (3,970 km New Line, 5,507 km Gauge Conversion and 11,151 km doubling) have been commissioned at an average of 2,579 km/year, which is 70 per cent more than the average commissioning during 2009-14 (1,520 km/year). Further, during the last eight years (2014-22), 30,446 Route Kilometres (RKM) have been electrified compared to an electrification of 4,698 RKM during the previous eight-year period, a more than six-fold increase.

12.45 The  fast  pace  of  infrastructure  augmentation  by  IR  has  been  a  result  of  substantial increase in allocation of funds and various steps being taken by the government. This includes delegation of powers at the field level which has helped in commissioning of doubling projects, close  monitoring  of  the  progress  of  projects  at  various  levels,  regular  follow-up  with  State Governments and relevant authorities  for  expeditious  land  acquisition,  forestry  and  wildlife clearances and resolving other issues pertaining to the projects.

## Box Xii.2:  Major initiatives of the indian railways

- Mumbai-Ahmedabad  High  Speed  Rail  (MAHSR)  Project:  The  MAHSR  project,  which was sanctioned by the government in 2015, with technical and financial cooperation from Government of Japan, is under execution and survey &amp; design aspects of it have been finalised.
- Dedicated Freight Corridor (DFC) Project: One of the most ambitious and biggest ever infrastructure  project  in  the  railways,  which  comprises  construction  of  two  dedicated freight corridors, i.e., Eastern and Western DFCs along the golden quadrilateral, will offer higher transport output in the country with reduced transit time and cost.
- GatiShakti  Multi-Modal  Cargo Terminal  (GCT):  GCTs  are  being  developed  by  private players on non-railway land   as well as fully/ partially on railway land, based on demand from industry and potential of cargo traffic. 21 GCTs have been commissioned and more than 90 more locations have been provisionally identified for development of GCTs (as of  31  October  2022).  This  will  boost  investment  from  industry  in  the  development  of additional terminals for handling rail cargos.
- Induction of semi-high-speed Vande Bharat Trainsets:  Semi High-Speed Self-Propelled Vande Bharat Trainsets were manufactured by Integral Coach Factory, Chennai, with indigenous efforts. These trains have ultra-modern features like quick acceleration, substantial reduction in  travel  time,  having  maximum  speed  of  160  kmph,  on-board  infotainment  and  Global Positioning System (GPS) based passenger information system, etc.
- Electrical/Electronic Interlocking System: envisages centralized operation of points and signals to enhance safety in train operations. These systems have been provided at 6,322 stations covering 99 per cent stations of Indian Railways (as of 30 September 2022).
- Development of Hyperloop technology: Hyperloop is an emerging transportation technology that  can  be  faster  and  greener  than  airplanes  and  railways.  In  this  system,  vehicles  run in the levitating state (with the help of Linear Induction Motors/Electromagnets) and in vacuum environment. The technology is still in the development phase. Indian Railways intends to develop a demonstrative project on Hyperloop Technology. Indian Railways has collaborated with IIT Madras for developing Hyperloop Technology by setting up Centre of Excellence for Hyperloop Technology at IIT Madras at the cost of ₹8.34 crore.
- Kisan Rail trains were introduced in FY21 to enable speedy movement of perishables from production or surplus regions to consumption or deficient regions. Up to 31 October 2022, Indian Railways have operated 2,359 Kisan Rail services, transporting approximately 7.91 lakh tonnes of perishables including fruits and vegetables.

## Civil Aviation: Revival backed by domestic demand

12.46 With  the  containment  of  Covid-19  infections  and  the  lifting  of  travel  restrictions worldwide, air travel has rebounded. While in FY21, there was a considerable decline in the air-traffic (a decline of 54 per cent) as well as passenger traffic handled (a decline of 66 per cent), FY22 saw a recovery, mainly led by the domestic sector. The current financial year has further shown a rebound, with both passenger and cargo movement close to the pre-Covid-19 levels. The total number of passengers carried in December 2022 stood at 150.1 lakh, which was 106.4 per cent of the pre-Covid level (average for 11 months from April 2019 to February 2020). During November 2022, total air cargo tonnage stood at 2.5 lakh MT, which is 89 per cent of the pre-Covid levels.

12.47 The civil aviation sector in India has great potential owing to growing demand from the  middle  class,  growth  in  population  and  tourism,  higher  disposable  incomes,  favourable demographics, and greater penetration of aviation infrastructure. This is further supported by the government through schemes such as UDAN, which has considerably enhanced regional connectivity  through  the  opening  of  airports  in  India's  hinterland.  Under  this  scheme,  the government has approved a budget of ₹4500 crore for revival of existing unserved/ underserved airports/airstrips  of  the  State  governments, Airports Authority  of  India  (AAI),  public  sector undertakings and civil enclaves. The government has also accorded 'in-principle' approval for the setting up of 21 greenfield airports across the country. More than one crore air passengers have availed themselves of the benefit of the UDAN scheme since its inception. The scheme focuses on the connectivity between the Tier-2 and 3 cities in the country and the number of beneficiaries will increase manifold as the connectivity improves between unserved and underserved airports.

## Ports: handling higher capacity with governance reforms

12.48 For ages, the sea has been the source of opportunity and seashores have acted as the gateways to prosperity for India. The development of ports is crucial for the economy, given that

most of the international trade is handled through ports (around 90 per cent of international trade cargo by volume and 79.9 per cent by value). The capacity of major ports, which was 871.5 Million Tonnes Per Annum (MTPA) at the end of March 2014, has increased to 1534.9 MTPA by the end of March 2022. Cumulatively they handled 720.1 MT traffic during FY22.

12.49 To meet the ever-increasing trade requirements, the expansion of port capacity has been accorded the highest priority by the government through the implementation of well-conceived infrastructure  development  projects.  To  further  enhance  their  efficiency,  the  government  is focusing  on  improving  port  governance,  addressing  low-capacity  utilisation,  modernising berths with techno efficient loading/unloading equipment, and creating new channels for port connectivity. For streamlining the port compliances and for reducing the Turn Around Time for (TAT) for vessels, long strides have been taken at the major ports towards the digitisation of key EXIM processes. The Port Community System (PCS 1x) has digitised processes such as  Electronic  Invoice  (e-Invoice),  Electronic  Payment  (e-Payment)  and  Electronic  Delivery Order  (e-DO)  for  the  physical  release  of  cargo  by  custodians,  in  addition  to  the  processes of generating electronic Bill of Lading (e-BL) and Letter of Credit (LC). Further, the Radio Frequency  Identification  Device  (RFID)  solution  has  been  implemented  at  all  major  ports to enable seamless movement of traffic across port gates, including substantial reductions in documentation checks. Additionally, the process to bootstrap PCS 1x into National Logistics Portal-Marine (NLP-Marine) is already under way which will act as a Unified Digital Platform for all maritime stakeholders.

## inland water transport: tapping the potential of navigable waterways

12.50 Inland water transport holds great untapped potential as a means for the transportation of goods and passengers. India has a large endowment of rivers, canals, and other waterways. The total navigable length of waterways in India is around 14,850 kilometres.

Note: Data pertains to 2020-21. **Data for Uttar Pradesh pertains to 2016-17

- 12.51 Under the National Waterways Act 2016, 106 new waterways have been declared as National Waterways (NWs), taking the total number of NWs in the country to 111. Based on the outcome of techno-economic feasibility and Detailed Project Reports (DPRs), 26 NWs viable for  cargo  movement have been prioritised, out of which developmental activities have been initiated in the 14 most viable NWs. Further, to promote the use of inland waterways, waterway usage charges levied by the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) on vessels moving on NWs were waived in July 2020, initially for a period of three years. The cargo movement on National Waterways achieved an all-time high of 108.8 million tons during FY22, recording 30.1 per cent growth compared to the previous year.
- 12.52 The Inland Vessels Bill 2021, which replaced the over 100 year-old Inland Vessels Act, 1917 (Act No.1 of 1917), was passed by the Parliament in August 2021. This will usher in a new era for inland water transport sector and fulfil the vision to utilise the potential of multi-modal transport ecosystem while making the legislative framework user-friendly and promoting ease of doing business. The uniform application of rules and regulations will ensure seamless, quick, and cost-efficient trade and transportation by inland vessels using the inland waterways. Various sections of this Act as detailed in the box below have come into force in 2022.

## Box Xii.3: inland Vessels act 2021

The Inland Vessels Act of 1917, which had undergone several amendments, had provisions for the restrictive movement of mechanically propelled vessels and non-uniform standards and regulations across different states. The Inland Vessels Act 2021, which replaced the erstwhile Act, aims to bring uniformity in the application of the law relating to inland waterways and navigation within the country. Some salient features of the Act include:

- State  governments  may  declare  by  notification  any  inland  water  area  as  a  'Zone' depending on the maximum significant wave height criteria as prescribed in the Act. Any mechanically propelled vessel would have to obtain a certificate, which would indicate the zone in which the vessel is to be operated.
- A central database of inland vessels would be maintained by the government.
- The standards for  qualification,  training,  training  institutes,  examination,  and  grant  of certificate of competency would be prescribed by the Central Government.
- Standards for prevention of environmental pollution.
- Constitution of a Development Fund by the State Government to be utilised for meeting emergency preparedness, containment of pollution, removal of unidentified wrecks or obstruction, boosting development works of inland water navigation, etc.

Overall, the new Act would lead to uniformity of rules across states ensuring unhindered and safe  movement of vessels within and across states. This is likely to promote inland water transport as a potential mode for large-scale movement of cargo as well as passengers across the country owing to its relative cost effectiveness.

## electricity: installed capacity growth driven by renewables

12.53 The total installed power capacity of utilities and captive power plants (industries having demand of 1 Mega Watt (MW) and above) was 482.2 GW on 31 March 2022 as compared to 460.7 GW on 31 March 2021, up by 4.7 per cent. Installed capacity in utilities was 399.5 GW on 31 March 2022 as against 382.1 GW a year back (higher by 4.5 per cent). Thermal sources of energy make up the largest (59.1 per cent) share of total installed capacity in utilities, followed by renewable energy resources with 27.5 per cent and hydro with 11.7 per cent.

12.54 The total electricity generated, including that from captive plants during the year FY22 was 17.2 lakh GWh as compared to 15.9 lakh GWh during the FY21, of which 14.8 lakh GWh was  generated  by  utilities  and  2.3  lakh  GWh  in  captive  plants.  Between  FY22  and  FY21, the  maximum rise in  electricity  generation  was  recorded  in  renewable  energy  resources  for utilities and for captive plants. There has been a gradual transition in India's energy sector from the conventional sources to the non-fossil fuel sources. India is steadfast in its commitments towards non-fossil fuel-based energy resources. India has put in place a target of achieving 50 per cent cumulative installed capacity for generating electric power from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by 2030. India is well on its way to fulfilling its commitments with the share of renewables in overall installed capacity growing at a fast pace. This is a result of the various government initiatives aimed at supporting the renewable energy sector.

12.55 Government of India has been driving a vibrant renewable energy programme aimed at achieving energy security and energy access, and reducing the carbon footprints of the national economy. In order to reduce the carbon footprint of the farm sector, Pradhan Mantri Kisan Urja Suraksha evam Utthaan Mahabhiyan (PM-KUSUM) aims to provide energy and water security,

de-dieselise  the  farm  sector  and  generate  additional  income  for  farmers  by  producing  solar power. In addition, the government has introduced the Solar Park Scheme to facilitate necessary infrastructure like land, power evacuation facilities, road connectivity, water facility, etc. along with all  statutory  clearances. As  on  30  September  2022,  the  government has sanctioned the entire target capacity of 40 GW for the development of 59 Solar Parks in 16 states.

12.56 Indian  Railways,  which  is  a  major  user  of  electricity  in  the  country,  has  announced its intention to achieve net zero carbon emission by 2030. In this regard, Indian Railways has reoriented its energy demand towards greater use of renewable sources. As of November 2022, plants generating about 143 MW of solar power (both on rooftops and on land) and about 103 MW of wind power have been commissioned.

12.57 Other  important  incentives  for  renewable  power  generation  include  Hydropower Purchase  Obligation  (HPO)  within  Non-Solar  Renewable  Purchase  Obligation  (RPO). With the  government  support,  the  private  sector  has  actively  participated  in  boosting  the  overall generation capacity and bringing down unit costs over a short period.
