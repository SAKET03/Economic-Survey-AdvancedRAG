# Resilient FDI Inflow in Manufacturing Sector

Resilient FDI inflow in Manufacturing Sector

9.15 Annual FDI equity inflows in the manufacturing sector have been steadily increasing over the last few years. It jumped from US$ 12.1 billion in FY21 to US$ 21.3 billion in FY22 as the pandemic-driven expansionary policies of advanced economies led to a surge in global

liquidity. With the rise in global uncertainty in the wake of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, FDI equity inflow in manufacturing in the first half of FY23 fell below its corresponding level in the first half of FY22. The monetary tightening at the global level has further restricted the FDI equity inflows. A rebound in FDI inflows is, however, expected as the Indian economy sustains its high growth while monetary tightening the world over eventually eases with the weakening of inflationary pressures.

9.16 Notwithstanding an overall drop in FDI in the first half of FY23, inflows have stayed above the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving the ease of doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world. The government has implemented an investor-friendly FDI policy under which FDI up to 100 per cent is permitted through automatic route in most sectors. India continues to open up its sectors to global investors by raising FDI limits, removing regulatory barriers, developing infrastructure, and improving the business environment.

## Box IX.2: FDI Policy Reforms to bolster Investment

- India continues to open up its sectors to global investors by raising FDI limits and removing regulatory barriers to attracting increased investments, in addition to developing infrastructure and improving the business environment. To make India a more attractive investment destination, the Government has implemented several radical and transformative FDI reforms across sectors such as Defence, Pension, e-commerce activities etc.
- In FY20, 100 per cent FDI under automatic route was permitted for the sale of coal, and coal mining activities, including associated processing infrastructure, subject to provisions of relevant acts. 26 per cent FDI under the government route has been permitted for uploading/ streaming of  News  &amp;  Current Affairs  through  Digital  Media.  100  per  cent  FDI  has  been  permitted  in Intermediaries  or  Insurance  Intermediaries , including  insurance  brokers,  reinsurance  brokers, insurance consultants, corporate agents, third-party administrators, Surveyors and Loss Assessors and such other entities as may be notified by the Insurance Regulatory and Development  Authority from time to time.

- To curb opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the government amended the FDI policy, according to which an entity of a country which shares a land border with India or where the beneficial owner of investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route. Further, in the event of the transfer of ownership of any existing or future FDI in an entity in India, directly or indirectly, resulting in the beneficial ownership falling within the restriction/purview of the said policy amendment, such subsequent change in beneficial ownership will also require government approval.
- To simplify the approval process of foreign Investment and to promote ease of doing business, the erstwhile Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) was abolished in May 2017, and a new regime has been put in place. Under the new regime, the process for granting FDI approvals has been simplified, wherein the work relating to the processing of applications for FDI has been delegated to the concerned Ministries/ Departments, and DPIIT is the nodal department for facilitating the process.
- A revamped portal, 'Foreign Investment Facilitation Portal (FIF Portal)', has been launched as the online single-point interface of the Government of India for investors to facilitate Foreign Direct  Investment.  The  portal  facilitates  single  window  clearance  of  applications  which  are through the government approval route. The FIF Portal has been integrated with the National Single Window System (NSWS).
