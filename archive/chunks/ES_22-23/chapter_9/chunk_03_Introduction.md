# Introduction

introduction  of  the  Emergency  Credit  Linked  Guarantee  Scheme (ECLGS).  While  the  growth  in  total  credit  has  been  driven  by  an  increase  in  credit demanded by MSMEs, large industries have begun to increase the pace of their credit offtake too since the beginning of FY23 as they look to reduce their pace of capital raising from volatile  debt  and  equity  markets.  The  robust  growth  in  credit  demand  combined with rising capacity utilisation and investment in manufacturing underscores businesses' optimism regarding future demand.

Amidst heightened global uncertainty, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the manufacturing sector moderated in the first half of FY23. However, inflows stayed well above the pre-pandemic levels, driven by structural reforms and measures improving the ease of doing business, making India one of the most attractive FDI destinations in the world.

The electronics industry continues to ascend in importance as its applications become pervasive. Electronics, supported by continuously improving communication services, will significantly enhance productivity, efficient service delivery, and social transformation. This industry's significant growth drivers are mobile phones, consumer electronics, and industrial electronics. In the mobile phone segment, India has become the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer globally, with the production of handsets going up from 6 crore units in FY15 to 29 crore units in FY21.

The Indian Pharmaceuticals industry plays a prominent role in the global pharmaceuticals industry. India is ranked 3rd worldwide in the production of pharma products by volume and  14th  by  value.  The  sector  is  the  largest  provider  of  generic  medicines  globally, occupying a 20 per cent share in global supply by volume, and is also the leading vaccine manufacturer globally with a market share of 60 per cent. The performance of pharma exports has been robust, sustaining positive growth despite the global trade disruptions and drop in demand for Covid-19-related treatments. The cumulative FDI in the pharma sector crossed the US$ 20 billion mark by September 2022.

The pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict have demonstrated the risk of supply chain shocks to the global economic order. As companies adapt their manufacturing and supply chain strategies to build resilience, India has a unique opportunity to become a global manufacturing hub this decade. In this context, the government's Make-in-India initiative has facilitated investment, fostered innovation and built world-class infrastructure while addressing  the  gaps  in  domestic  manufacturing  capabilities.  The  Production  Linked Incentive  (PLI)  schemes  across  14  categories  has  further  complemented  it  with  an estimated Capex of around â‚¹3 lakh crore over the next five years and the potential to generate over 60 lakh jobs. In the medium term, the scheme will help reduce net imports by building domestic manufacturing capacity that will cater to domestic and global needs.

## Introduction

- 9.1 Industry holds a prominent position in the Indian economy, accounting for 31 per cent of GDP, on average, during FY12 and FY21 and employing over 12.1 crore people. The sector's relevance  can  be  identified  through  various  direct  and  indirect  linkages  with  other  sectors, contributing to economic growth and employment. First, it ensures that domestic production can  accommodate domestic demand and reduces the reliance on imports. Thereby assisting in  the  improvement  of  trade  and  current  account  balances.  Second,  industrial  growth  has multiplier effects, which translates into employment growth. Some industries, such as textiles and construction, have high employment elasticities. Third, industrial growth spurs growth in services sectors such as banking, insurance, logistics, etc.

- 9.2 Industrial production is a means to increase industrial income in the country. As measured by industrial GVA, growth in industrial income has kept pace with overall GVA growth in the economy since the pre-pandemic year of FY20. Manufacturing GVA, which contributes more than 50 per cent of industrial GVA, has grown at an even higher rate when compared to overall GVA. In FY23, the Industry sector witnessed modest growth of 4.1 per cent compared to the strong growth of 10.3 per cent in FY22. This is likely on account of input cost-push pressures, supply chain disruptions and the China lockdown impacting the availability of essential inputs and slowing the global economy. The fading away of the base effect must have also weighed on growth in FY23. On a positive note, estimates of H2:FY23 shows improvement in overall industrial growth, especially in the manufacturing sector, both yearly and sequentially. Easing input prices and conducive demand conditions will support growth, ceteris paribus.
- 9.3 In this chapter, the survey will review the performance of the Indian industry in the current financial year. It explores the demand stimulants to industrial growth, the supply response of the industry, trends in credit to the industry and foreign investment in India's industrial sector. The chapter also addresses the developments in key sub-industries and their challenges. Towards the end, it evaluates India's aspirations and prospects of becoming a key player in global value chains.

## Demand Stimulus to Industrial Growth

- 9.4 FY23 began with the month-old Russian-Ukraine conflict showing no signs of relenting. As the year draws to a close, the conflict appears to have plateaued, although global commodity prices  are  yet  to  deescalate  to  their  pre-pandemic  levels.  Industry,  throughout  the  year,  has thus faced high input costs imported into the country. Fearing demand impact, the industry has been gradually passing on the higher production costs, which has led to sticky but non-rising core retail inflation. Non-core retail inflation, on the other hand, comprising food and energy components, has been declining as local weather extremities have eased and interventions by the government to restrict price rises have proven effective. The consequent decrease in overall retail inflation has thus sustained the pent-up consumer demand in the post-pandemic Indian economy, inducing an industrial recovery despite the global headwinds. With world commodity prices now also on a downward trajectory and showing up in declining rates of India's wholesale inflation, core retail inflation is expected to relent, making domestic consumption demand much stronger to further induce industrial growth in the country. PFCE as a share of GDP in H1 of FY23 was the highest since FY15.
- 9.5 Strong external demand also served the Indian industry well in FY22 when manufactured exports soared, responding to a rebound in global growth. Trade had also recovered and grown as bottlenecks in global supply chains eased. The export stimulus for the Indian economy persisted in the first half of FY23. In this half of the year, exports of goods and services as a share of GDP have been the highest since FY16. However, the export impulse has been waning in the first half itself as the YoY growth of exports has declined from Q1 to Q2 due to persistently high inflation and rising interest rates in the advanced economies. Export growth may slow further in the second half of the current financial year and remain weak beyond that, too, if the global economy falls into recession. However, the strong domestic consumption growth and investment revival is expected to keep industrial production humming.
- 9.6 Indeed, an increase in investment demand has emerged as another powerful stimulus to industrial growth. It has been triggered by a jump in the Capex of the central government in the current and the previous year as compared to the pre-pandemic years. The leap also has crowded-in  private  investment,  already  upbeat  on  the  pent-up  consumption  demand,  export stimulus,  and  strengthening  of  the  corporate  balance  sheets.  Capacity  utilisation  at  74.3  per cent in Q1 of FY23 has already reached the tipping point of 75.3 per cent in Q4 of FY22, at which investments in building new capacities are undertaken. New Investment announced in the manufacturing sector during April-December of FY23 was five times the corresponding level in FY20. The surge in investment is also attributable to the policy actions taken by the Government over the past several years. A beginning has been made in H1 of FY23, which recorded the highest share of Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) in GDP among all half-years since FY15.

## Box IX.1: Unfolding of Private capital Investment cycle

A view is fast emerging that the private sector is predisposed to increasing investment in the third decade of the new millennium. This has roots in the first decade of the new millennium when a credit boom financed rising levels of investment rates. Consequently, by the time the second decade began, the balance sheets of both the corporates and banks became stressed. As a result, corporates switched focus from investment to deleveraging while banks slowed credit disbursement in view of high NonPerforming Assets (NPAs). Consequently, the investment rate declined, and the economy began to slow. Midway into the second decade, the problems were identified, and mitigation measures were initiated. For the banks, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) was instituted to resolve their stressed assets while the equity base of public sector banks was strengthened. For the corporates, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rollout improved their ease of doing business while the corporate tax rate  was  slashed  to  increase  their  profits/  investible  reserves  for  financing  investment.  During  the pandemic, the implementation of ECLGS lent additional support to the MSMEs. Maturing digital infrastructure and easy and cheap data access have further enriched the investment climate.

Note: Credit to the non-financial sector captures the borrowing activity of the private non-financial sector.

Deleveraging has strengthened the corporate balance sheets, as evident in the declining core debt of the private non-financial sector. Credit to the private non-financial sector as a percentage of GDP in India had come down from a peak of 113.0 per cent in December 2010 to a low of 83.8 per cent in  December 2018. This shows that de-leveraging was completed by the end of 2018. With the elections out of the way in May 2019 and with corporate tax cuts announced in September 2019, it  would have resulted in an improvement in investment and economic growth cycles, but it was delayed due to the disruption caused by the pandemic for two years. Deleveraging resumed from the beginning of FY22 as core debt of the private non-financial sector decreased to 87.8 per cent of GDP in the June 2022 quarter from 100.7 per cent in the March 2021 quarter on the back of improved corporate performance and a recovery in GDP levels.

During H1:FY23, the interest coverage ratio was 5, higher than its five-year (FY20) average of 3. The debt-equity ratio also declined from 0.8 to 0.4. These improvements have further absorbed the increase  in  working  capital  requirements  triggered  by  volatility  in  global  commodity  prices  and supply chain disruptions. On the other hand, profit margins peaked in the second half of FY21 as low inflation kept input costs from rising while restricted mobility reduced overheads. Subsequently, profit margins started to decline as input costs rose on the back of rising global commodity prices. With global commodity prices declining, input costs are set to fall, and profit margins are expected to increase. Expected increases in profits and strengthened balance sheets have made the corporate sector financially stronger and optimistic about increasing net sales. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) Industrial Outlook Survey conducted during July-September 2022 points towards optimism about production, order books, employment, and profit margins for the period covered until Q1 of FY24.

The credit boom in the first decade increased the banking sector advances to the non-financial sector from 36.5 per cent of GDP in 2004 to 57.3 per cent in 2014 (Bank for International Settlements). This led to the RBI imposing a more stringent assessment of NPAs. Consequently, NPAs rose from 4.3 per cent of gross bank advances in FY15 to 11.2 per cent in FY18. However, with the enforcement of the IBC code and a more disciplined approach to credit disbursements, NPA fell to 7.3 per cent in FY21 and to a seven-year low of 5.0 per cent in September 2022. The Capital-to-Risk-Weighted Assets Ratio (CRAR) and provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) have also improved and stood at 16.0 per cent and 71.5 per cent, respectively, in September 2022. With well-capitalised banks ready and willing to lend and corporates financially stronger and willing to borrow, the credit-investment cycle is poised for an upturn in the third decade.
