# Robust Growth in Bank Credit to Industry

Robust Growth in Bank credit to Industry

9.13 Growth in bank credit  has  kept  pace  with  industrial  growth,  with  a  sequential  surge evident  since  January  2022. While  a  large  share  of  bank  credit  continues  to  be  assigned  to large industries, credit to MSMEs has also seen a significant increase in part assisted by the introduction of the ECLGS, which supports around 1.2 crore businesses of which 95 per cent are MSMEs 1 . The impact of ECLGS on increasing the growth of credit to MSME was felt most during the pandemic impacted years of 2020 and 2021. It continued in 2022 as the scheme was extended to March 2023. Furthermore, growth in credit to MSME was buttressed by rebounding consumption levels, particularly in the services sector. Consequently, the share of MSMEs in gross credit offtake to the industry rose from 17.7 per cent in January 2020 to 23.7 per cent in November 2022. While the growth in total credit has been driven by an increase in credit demanded by MSMEs, large industries have also begun to increase the pace of their credit offtake since the beginning of FY23. With the spread between corporate bond yields and marginal costs of funds-based lending rate (MCLR) narrowing, and the volatility in the corporate bond market remaining high, corporates appear to be shifting their sources of financing from bond markets to  bank  capital,  where  rates  have  remained  stable  and  predictable.  Robust  growth  in  credit demand combined with rising capacity utilisation and investment in manufacturing underscores businesses' optimism regarding future demand.

9.14 All  segments  within  the  manufacturing  sector  except  the  textile  industry  witnessed growth in credit offtake in November 2022. While segments such as 'Petroleum, coal products and nuclear fuels', 'Rubber, plastic and their products', and 'Engineering' have had a steady credit appetite, the improvement in growth of credit to the cement and construction sectors over the past year reflects the improved outlook of the construction sector.
