# Product and Capital Market Reforms

product and capital market reforms over the previous three decades. It further delves into the overarching philosophy behind the landmark reforms undertaken from 2014 to 2022 and elaborates on the shocks faced by the Indian economy during this period. It concludes with a discussion on the medium-term growth magnets for India.

## product and Capital Market reforms

## Initiation of the reforms- 1991

- 2.3 The macroeconomic imbalances of the late 1980s and early 1990s pushed the government towards introducing the structural reforms of 1991. The high combined deficit of the central and  state  governments,  elevated  inflationary  pressures,  and  large  and  unsustainable  current account deficit (CAD) led to a balance of payments crisis in the Indian economy. 1 In response to the situation, trade and investments were liberalised in 1991. Import licensing on almost all intermediate inputs and capital goods was done away with, and the entry restrictions for firms were simplified. The new policy encouraged the entry of private sector firms by ending the public sector monopoly in many sectors and initiating the automatic approval policy for FDI up to 51 per cent. The exchange rate was made flexible and allowed to depreciate as necessary to maintain competitiveness. The rupee was made fully convertible on the current account and partially on the capital account. These reforms had a positive effect on the economy. The real growth went up from an average of 5.5 per cent during the 1980s to 6.3 per cent from FY93 to FY2000. Trade liberalisation had a visible effect on external trade as the total goods and services trade to GDP rose from 17.2 per cent in 1990 to 30.6 per cent in 2000. 2

## Continuity in reforms with a renewed Impetus

- 2.4 The product and capital market reforms continued slowly over the decade of the 1990s. They got a renewed impetus from the government closer to the decade's end. Investments were liberalised further to encourage Foreign Direct Investment as a main source of non-debt-creating capital inflows (Figure II.1). The telecom sector was entirely reformed by the New Telecom Policy 1999. It was opened for private sector participation with a strengthened regulatory regime (TRAI). The reforms separated the licensing and policy functions of the government from that of an operator (BSNL). These reforms were a cornerstone for the IT sector boom in India and had widespread spillover benefits to other sectors of the economy. The policy on disinvestment and privatisation also gathered steam during this period. The government set up a dedicated Ministry to take this agenda forward. It sold equity stakes in some CPSEs and privatised companies such as Maruti Udyog, Hindustan Zinc, Bharat Aluminum, and Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited.

2.5 This period also marked the launch of the then largest infrastructure project of independent India, the  'Golden Quadrilateral'.  The project brought significant economic benefits to the country through  enhanced  connectivity,  improved  industrial  activity,  trade,  and  economic  growth. 3 Alongside this, structural policies were formulated to address the macroeconomic imbalances. The Fiscal  Responsibility  and  Budget  Management  (FRBM) Act was passed to address the historic highs of the combined Gross fiscal deficit of the Government (Figure II.2). The banking system, which had accumulated bad debts during the period of economic resurgence after the 1991 reforms, was supported through the deregulation of interest rates and the enactment of the SARFAESI Act 2002. Interest rates were deregulated to promote competition amongst banks, provide more banking options to depositors, and strengthen monetary policy transmission. 4 The SARFAESI Act allowed banks and financial institutions to recover their dues by proceeding against  the  secured  assets  of  the  borrower/guarantor  without  the  intervention  of  the  court/ tribunals. 5 Both these reforms improved the credit situation in the economy (Figure II.3).

## one-off shocks overshadowed The reforms of 1998-2002

2.6 The period of these reforms also witnessed a series of domestic and global shocks, which subdued investor confidence. The sanctions imposed by the US on India after India's nuclear test led to a sharp decline in capital flows to India during the months following the nuclear tests (Figure II.4) 6 . The period between 2000 and 2002 also witnessed two successive droughts (Table II.1). These domestic shocks were accompanied by heightened global uncertainties resulting from the end of a tech boom and the 9/11 attacks (Figure II.5). Moreover, the balance sheets of the Indian financial system and corporate sector were under-repair during the period. Though all these factors overshadowed the immediate impact of reforms undertaken by the government then, they laid the groundwork and prepared the Indian economy structurally to participate in the Global boom which followed soon after.

## India's participation in The Global Boom of 2003-08

- 2.7 The  growth  dividends  from  the  reforms  of  1998-2002  were  realised  once  these  oneoff  shocks  dissipated.  The  years  of  structural  reforms  had  prepared  the  Indian  economy  to contribute  to  global  growth  and  also  benefit  from  it.  While  the  global  growth  averaged  4.8 per cent during 2003-2008, the Indian economy grew at more than 8 per cent on average. The economic growth during the period was supported by strong capital inflows (Figure II.1), which indicated favourable domestic and external factors. Some of these included sustained momentum in domestic economic activity, better corporate performance, a conducive investment climate, positive  sentiments  for  India  as  a  preferred  investment  destination,  and  encouraging  global liquidity conditions/ interest rates. 7 This combination of structural economic reforms with their lagged effect on economic growth has parallels to what is unfolding in the Indian economy presently.

## reforms for new India-sabka saath sabka Vikaas

2.8 The reforms undertaken before 2014 primarily catered to product and capital market space. They were necessary and continued post-2014 as well. The government, however, imparted a new dimension to these reforms in the last eight years. With an underlying emphasis on enhancing the ease of living and doing business and improving economic efficiency, the reforms are well placed to lift the economy's potential growth. The broad principles behind the reforms were creating public goods, adopting trust-based governance, co-partnering with the private sector for development, and improving agricultural productivity (Figure II.6). This approach reflects a paradigm shift in the growth and development strategy of the government, with the emphasis shifted towards building partnerships amongst various stakeholders in the development process, where each contributes to and reaps the development benefits ( Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas ).

- 2.9 While  the  reforms  undertaken  in  the  post-2014  period  have  multiple  socioeconomic benefits for the economy, this chapter focuses on the growth-centric aspects of these reforms.

The  forthcoming  section  discusses  how  each  of  the  principles  that  anchor  the  new  reform framework contributes to enhancing the productive potential of the economy and its people. These have more profound positive implications for India's medium-term growth outlook.

## I. Creating public goods to enhance opportunities, efficiencies and ease of living

2.10  The  launch  of  the  Golden  Quadrilateral  project  in  the  2000s  was  the  beginning  of infrastructure-intensive policymaking in India, which continued sedately for another decade. A quantum leap in policy commitment and outlay for infrastructure is now visible in the last few years (Figure II.7), cushioning economic growth when the non-financial corporate sector was unable to invest due to balance sheet troubles. In doing so, the government has laid a good platform for crowding in private investments and growth in the coming decade. 8

2.11  The dedicated programs for road connectivity (Bharatmala), port infrastructure (Sagarmala),  electrification,  railways  upgradation,  and  operationalising  new  airports/  air routes (UDAN) have significantly improved the physical infrastructure in the last few years (Figure II.8). The details on the upgradation of physical infrastructure may be seen in Chapter 12.  With  the  National  Infrastructure  Pipeline  (NIP)  in  2019  and  the  National  Monetization Pipeline in 2021, a strong baseline for infrastructure creation and development has been put in place, providing a multitude of opportunities for foreign investment and engagement. The NIP was launched with 6,835 infrastructure projects with a projected infrastructure investment of ₹111 lakh crore. This has expanded to over 9,000 projects across 35 sub-sectors and covers economic and social infrastructure projects jointly funded by the Central Government, State Governments, and the private sector. With its strong forward and backward linkages, physical infrastructure will enhance the economy's productivity in the medium term.

2.12  Besides  the  push  to  physical  infrastructure,  the  government's  emphasis  on  developing public digital infrastructure during the last few years has been a game changer in enhancing the economic potential of individuals and businesses. A recently published article 9 in the RBI's Monthly Bulletin estimates that India's core digital economy has grown at 2.4 times the overall economic growth between 2014 and 2019. With its strong forward linkages to the non-digital sectors,  digitalisation strengthens potential economic growth through various channels. Some of these, such as higher financial inclusion, greater formalisation, increased efficiencies and enhanced opportunities, are discussed below.

2.13  Based  on  the  pillars  of  a  digital  identity Aadhar,  linking  bank  accounts  with  PM-Jan Dhan Yojana, and the penetration of mobile phones (JAM Trinity), the country has witnessed significant progress in financial inclusion in recent years. The population covered with bank accounts  increased  from  53  per  cent  in  2015-16  to  78  per  cent  in  2019-21  (as  per  NFHS). International evidence shows that countries at the same level of development have taken almost half a century to achieve the extent of India's massive expansion in access to bank accounts (D'Silva et al. 2019) 10 .  Numerous digital public goods such as digital verification (e-KYC), digital signature, digital repositories (Digilocker), and digital payments (UPI) have supported financial inclusion by improving access to formal financial services and reducing transaction costs. 11 Greater  financial  inclusion  and  access  to  credit  incentivise  higher  consumption  and investment,  leading  to  higher  economic  growth.  Some  of  the  recently  introduced  digital initiatives, such as the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) and Account Aggregator framework, will open up further avenues for e-commerce market access and credit availability for smaller businesses and strengthen the expected economic growth in the medium term.

2.14  Another vital contribution of digital infrastructure has been the greater formalisation of the economy. A report in The Economist (January 2023) attributes the trends of formalisation of the workforce in India to the transformed digital financial architecture, the digitalised GST system and growth in the usage of UPI. 12 The creation of digital identities such as Aadhar, registration of  unorganised  workers  on  the  eshram  portal,  street  vendors  on  SV ANidhi,  taxpaying  firms on GSTN, and MSMEs on the Udayam portal, has played a significant role in the inclusion of these groups under the formal economic net. As an illustration, we can now track that out of the 1.27 crore enterprises registered on the Udyam Portal, more than 93,000 micro-enterprises have grown to become small enterprises, and 10,000 small enterprises have become medium enterprises over the last two years. 13 Creating an identity has also simplified and enabled access to formal credit for many of these groups. More than 32.7 lakh street vendors have availed of a first loan of ₹10,000 under the PM SVANidhi Scheme, and of these, more than 6.9 lakh have availed a second loan of ₹20,000. Moreover, digital systems such as the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) and e-Way Bill system have enabled the formalisation of business transactions. The increasing number of GST taxpayers, from 70 lakh in 2017 14  to more than 1.4 crore in 2022, indicates the expansion in formal businesses. Formalisation of transactions, for even the smallest of amounts, has been possible with the wide usage of the digital payment system of UPI. The greater formalisation will enhance the productivity of individuals and businesses in the economy through improved access to credit and efficiency gains in their operations.

2.15  Gains from economic and structural reforms tend to be more significant when the binding constraints of governance have been addressed. 15 Unified digital interfaces that connect various initiatives/portals have simplified governance resulting in a more efficient resource allocation in the economy. The National Single Window System for business approvals, the JanSamarth portal for  credit-linked  Central  Government  scheme,  and  the UMANG  app for  access  to Central and state government services are essential steps towards enhancing the ease of doing business through the integration of existing systems. Eshram portal , with more than 28.5 crore registered workers, has been integrated with various other digital portals for easy accessibility. PM Gatishakti, the GIS-based platform that brings together multiple ministries for integrated planning and coordinated implementation of multimodal infrastructure connectivity projects, aims to reduce logistics costs. Thus, digitaltechnologies being at the forefront of the reforms provide a unique opportunity to accelerate India's economic growth. More details on the strides in digital infrastructure may be seen in chapter 12.

## II. Trust-based Governance

2.16  Building trust between the government and the citizens/businesses unleashes efficiency gains through improved investor sentiment, better ease of doing business, and more effective governance. Consistent reforms have been made in this direction during the last eight years. Simplification of regulatory frameworks through reforms such as the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) and the Real Estate(Regulation and Development) Act (RERA) have enhanced the ease of doing business. The IBC has imbibed some of the best international practices of an asset

resolution mechanism. It provides an honourable exit mechanism for honest business failures and enables the release of credit locked into the stressed assets for better resource allocation. This market-driven, transparent resolution mechanism instils confidence in the financial system and attracts many new investors to invest in Indian businesses. 16 A significant achievement of the IBC has been the change brought in the debtor-creditor relationship. Debtors are resolving stress early to avoid being pushed into insolvency. Until 30 September 2022, 23,417 applications for initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP) of corporate debtors having underlying defaults of ₹7.3 lakh crore were disposed of before their admission into CIRP. 17

- 2.17  The other regulatory reform, Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA), is creating a culture of transparent transactions in the real estate sector. 18 The Act has transformed the real estate sector by registering real estate brokers and agents with the regulator, establishing mechanisms for the speedy redressal of disputes and enabling a single window clearance for timely approvals to the developers. The Real Estate Regulatory Authorities across the country have disposed off more than 1.06 lakh complaints. With 99262 projects and 71514 agents already registered under RERA, the Act incentivises more investments into the sector.

2.18  Another significant reform to enhance doing business has been the decriminalisation of minor economic offences under the Companies Act of 2013 (Table II.2). By introducing civil liabilities  for  dealing  with  simple  defaults  that  do  not  involve  fraud  or  where  the  nature  of the lapse is purely procedural, the government has demonstrated its intent to promote ease of doing business for domestic and global investors. Furthermore, a trust-based approach towards compliance builds entrepreneurs' faith in corporate institutions and motivates them to adopt fairer and more transparent business practices. After the reform, more than 1400 default cases have been decided without resorting to the court. Also, more than 4,00,000 companies have willingly rectified past defaults to avoid penalties under the Companies Act. 19

19 Using the Companies Fresh Start Scheme

unnecessary compliances, repealing more than 1400 archaic laws, abolishing the Angel tax and removing retrospective taxation on offshore indirect transfer of assets located in India, signal the government's resolve to ensure a non-adversarial policy environment. These efforts have improved investor sentiments and strengthened the growth potential.

2.20  In particular, the taxation ecosystem in the country has undergone substantial reforms in the post-2014 period. Tax policy reforms such as adopting a unified GST, reducing corporate tax rates, exemption of sovereign wealth funds and pension funds from taxes, and removing the Dividend Distribution tax have reduced the tax burden on individuals and businesses; and have removed the distortionary incentives from the economy. GST, for instance, has helped businesses by reducing compliances, ensuring a free flow of goods across states, doing away with the need for businesses to have a separate warehouse for every state, and hence improving the ease of doing business. The earlier indirect tax regime was origin based, and it distorted the location choices of the businesses.

2.21  Despite  tax  rationalisation,  a  positive  trend  of  higher  tax  buoyancy  is  visible  in  the economy. The notable economist Indira Rajaraman termed GST 'a revenue success' in 2019 20 ; thereafter,  the  positive  GST  revenue  collection  trends  have  strengthened  further  despite  the pandemic. The average monthly gross GST collection has increased from ₹0.90 lakh crore in FY18 to ₹1.49 lakh crore in FY23 (Figure II.9). Evidence suggests that the buoyancy of the indirect tax system replaced by GST has improved in the post-GST regime (Box III.1, Chapter 3). Since other tax reforms, such as the corporate tax cut, were followed by the pandemic-led uncertainty and disruptions, their impact on collections is gradually becoming visible in higher tax collections. The Corporate tax collections for April to November 2022 have increased by 21.1 per cent on a YoY basis compared to a longer-term average YoY growth of 10.3 per cent during the corresponding period from FY13 to FY19.

2.22  One  prominent  reason  behind  the  higher  revenue  buoyancy  is  the  introduction  of technology-backed tax governance reforms for simplifying tax processes, enhancing compliance, and improving fraud detection systems. The faceless assessment and appeal systems no longer require  a  physical  interface  between  taxpayers  and  the  Income  Tax  department.  Moreover, multiple  consistency  checks  possible  with  integrated  digital  systems  reduce  tax  evasion. As an illustration, the GST return filing mechanism results in better income reporting, leading to higher direct tax collections. In this regard, the decision to share data and information between CBDT and CBIC on an automatic and regular basis is a promising reform, and it would result in efficiency gains in the tax system. These reforms augur well for future economic growth and future resource mobilisation in the economy.

## III. promoting the private sector as a co-partner in the development

2.23  A  fundamental  principle  behind  the  government's  policy  in  the  post-  2014  period  has been  the  engagement  with  the  private  sector  as  a  partner  in  the  development  process.  The government's disinvestment policy has been revived in the last eight years with stake sales and the successful listing of PSEs on the stock market. During FY15 to FY23 (as of 18 January 2023), an amount of about ₹4.07 lakh crore has been realised as proceeds from disinvestment through 154 transactions using various modes/instruments. The privatisation of Air India was particularly significant for re-igniting the privatisation drive. Evidence shows that privatisation has  improved labour productivity and the overall efficiency of the PSUs disinvested during 1990-2015. 21 The New Public Sector Enterprise Policy for Aatmanirbhar Bharat has thus been introduced to realise higher efficiency gains by minimising the presence of the government in the PSEs to only a few strategic sectors.

2.24  Significant initiatives have been introduced under Aatmanirbhar Bharat and Make in India programmes to enhance India's manufacturing capabilities and exports across the industries. Sectorspecific Production Linked incentives (PLI) have been introduced in the aftermath of the pandemic to incentivise domestic and foreign investments and to develop global Champions in the manufacturing industry. The PLI scheme will significantly boost production, exports and employment in the medium term; however, its impact will be visible only with time. Early estimates of the impact of PLI show encouraging trends in some sectors. The PLI scheme for large-scale electronics manufacturing has attracted an investment of ₹4,784 crore and contributed to a total production of ₹2.04 lakh crore, including exports of ₹80,769 crore (as of September 2022) 22 . The need for a dedicated government policy to support domestic industrialisation amidst foreign competition can be better appreciated from the industrialisation experiences of East Asian countries such as South Korea and Taiwan in 1960-1990. These countries supported their domestic industries during their high growth phase, while also ensuring healthy competition required for the industries to grow. 23

2.25  Production incentives under Aatmanirbhar Bharat also incentivise foreign investments for domestic production. The last eight years have seen further liberalisation of the policy towards foreign investors, with most sectors now open for 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) under the automatic route. This has resulted in a visible structural shift in the gross FDI flows to India

during the last decade. India's gross FDI has increased from an average of 2.2 per cent of GDP during FY05-FY14 to 2.6 per cent in FY15-FY22 (Figure II.10). The highest-ever annual gross FDI inflow of USD 84.8 billion was recorded in FY22. These trends are an endorsement of India's status as a preferred investment destination amongst global investors.

2.26  The  government  is  developing  enabling  infrastructure  for  making  India  a  cost-effective production hub. The National Logistics Policy (2022) 24 has been launched to create an overarching logistics ecosystem for lowering the cost of logistics and bringing it to par with other developed countries.  This  would  boost  economic  growth,  provide  employment  opportunities,  and  make Indian products more competitive in the global market. Moreover, opening the strategic sectors, such as defence, mining and space, for the private sector has enhanced the business opportunities in the economy. Investment incentives and easing business compliances have created an ecosystem for the start-ups to nurture. The number of recognised Start-ups has increased from 452 in 2016 to 84,012 in 2022. More details on reforms for industries may be seen in Chapter 9.

2.27  Reforms to address the structural challenges faced by MSMEs have been a vital part of the industrial policy in recent years. Support measures for MSMEs during the pandemic in the form of the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) and revision in the definition of  MSMEs under the ambit of Aatmanirbhar Bharat helped them face the crisis shock. The ECLGS, in particular, has in the last two years benefited 1.14 crore MSMEs, which have availed collateral-free loans amounting to ₹2.38 lakh crore. Further measures, such as the introduction of TReDS to address the delayed payments for MSMEs, the inclusion of Retail and Wholesale trades as MSMEs, and the extension of non-tax benefits for three years in case of an upward change in the status of MSMEs, have created a resilient support system for the MSME sector to grow. The MSMEs have also benefitted from access to digital platforms for their marketing needs and easy payments. With the Open Network for Digital Commerce creating opportunities for  MSMEs to access  e-commerce  technology  and  diversify  their  target  markets,  this  trend will likely strengthen further. Moreover, onboarding GSTN as a Financial information provider

on  the Account  aggregator  platform  will  open  up  avenues  for  access  to  credit  for  MSMEs. Enhancing opportunities and productivity of the MSME sector have large-scale implications for a resilient production ecosystem, thus strengthening the growth prospects of the industry and the economy as a whole. These reforms, therefore, must continue.

## IV. enhancing productivity in agriculture

2.28  The agriculture sector in India has grown at an average annual growth rate of 4.6 per cent during the last six years. This growth is partly attributable to good monsoon years and partly to the various reforms undertaken by the government to enhance agricultural productivity. Policies such as Soil Health Cards, the Micro irrigation Fund, and organic and natural farming have helped the  farmers  optimise  resource  use  and  reduce  the  cultivation  cost.  The  promotion  of  Farmer Producer Organisations (FPOs) and the National Agriculture Market (e-NAM) extension Platform have empowered farmers, enhanced their resources, and enabled them to get good returns. Agri Infrastructure Fund (AIF) has supported the creation of various agriculture infrastructures. Kisan Rail exclusively caters to  the  movement  of  perishable  Agri  Horti  commodities.  Cluster  Development Programme (CDP) has promoted integrated and market-led development for horticulture clusters. Support for creating a Start-up ecosystem in agriculture and allied sectors is also being provided to  the  farmers. All  these  measures  are  directed  towards  supporting  the  growth  in  agricultural productivity and sustaining its contribution to overall economic growth in the medium term.
