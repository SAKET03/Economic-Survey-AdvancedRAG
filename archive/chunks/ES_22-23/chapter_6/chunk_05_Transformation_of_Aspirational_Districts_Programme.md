transformation of aspirational districts programme

6.10 The  Government  of  India  launched  the  'Transformation  of  Aspirational  Districts' (Aspirational Districts Programme (ADP)) initiative in January 2018 with a vision of a New India by 2022 wherein the focus is to raise living standards of its citizens and ensuring inclusive growth of all in the burgeoning economy. The districts are prodded and encouraged first to catch up with the best district of their state, and subsequently aspire to become one of the best in the

country, by competing with and learning from others in the spirit of competitive and cooperative federalism.

- 6.11 117 Aspirational Districts (ADs) across 28 States/UTs have been identified by NITI  Aayog based upon composite indicators ranging from health and nutrition, education, agriculture, and water resources, financial inclusion and skill development, and basic infrastructure which have an impact on HDI. The broad contours of the programme are Convergence (of Central &amp; State Schemes),  Collaboration  (of  Central,  State  level  Nodal  Officers  &amp;  District  Collectors),  and Competition among districts through monthly delta ranking; all driven by a mass movement.
- 6.12 With States as the main drivers, this programme focuses on the strength of each district, identifying low-hanging fruits for immediate improvement and measuring progress by ranking districts every month. The ranking is based on the incremental progress made across 49 Key Performance Indicators (KPI) under five broad socio-economic themes mentioned above.
- 6.13 NITI Aayog has developed a broad template for the formulation of district plans. Since different  districts  have  different  opportunities  and  challenges,  they  have  been  advised  to customise the template. A primer comprising steps to be taken to improve each of the indicators, compiled from the inputs received from respective Ministries, has also been developed with the help of Central Ministries and the States and shared with district administration.

## 6.14 Achievements of the programme

- (a) Many ADs have surpassed the average state values in several indicators under the Health and Nutrition theme monitored under the programme. For instance, in 10 indicators of health, 73 ADs have surpassed the state averages.
- (b) The  programme  monitors  progress  across  five  focus  sectors.  All  districts  have  made significant  improvements  across  different  indicators  for  instance,  under  Health  and Nutrition, 46 districts have improved by up to 45 per cent, and 23 districts have improved by up to 69 per cent in critical indicators related to pregnant women's health which have a  bearing  on  the  Maternal  and  Infant  Mortality  Rates  such  as  frequency  and  coverage of  antenatal  care  check-ups;  regularity  of  supplementary  nutrition  intake  by  pregnant women, and timely Anaemia detection and treatment rate. Under education, 46 districts have  improved  by  up  to  34  per  cent,  and  29  districts  have  improved  by  up  to  49  per cent in critical indicators which affect learning outcomes attained by students such as the percentage of elementary schools complying with Right to Education Act, 2009 (RTE) specified  Pupil-Teacher  Ratio;  percentage  of  schools  with  functional  drinking  water facility and percentage of schools with functional girls' toilets.
- (c) While monitoring the outcome of financial inclusion, it was seen that ADs have performed better than non-aspirational districts. This means more people have access to bank accounts, more have been covered under the fold of government insurance schemes and more can secure MUDRA loans in ADs.
- (d) Several  ADs  have  reported  saturation  in  the  basic  infrastructure  indicators  like  the percentage  of  households  with  electricity  connection;  percentage  of  habitations  with

access  to  all-weather  roads  under  Pradhan  Mantri  Gram  Sadak  Yojana  (PMGSY); cumulative number of kilometres of all-weather road work completed as a percentage of total sanctioned kilometres in the district under PMGSY; and percentage of households with individual household washrooms, etc.

## Template of Good Governance

- 6.15 The ADP has emerged as a template  for  good  governance,  especially  in  remote  and difficult areas. At present, two programmes have been conceptualised along the lines of ADP design, one is ' Mission Utkarsh' and the other is 'Aspirational Blocks Programme' (ABP). On 22 January 2022, 'Mission Utkarsh' was launched, under which 15 Central Ministries, having an interface with the public, have identified their low performing 10-15 districts. Following the ADP template, the Ministries have launched actions to bring these districts at par with an average district in the state in one year and close to the all-India average in another.
- 6.16 The Central Government and States have come together to use the ADP template to identify backward blocks and use similar data monitoring and competition-based programme to improve the most under-developed blocks in the country. In order to further strengthen this initiative,  500  most  backward  blocks  across  States  and  UTs  have  been  identified  for  rapid development.
