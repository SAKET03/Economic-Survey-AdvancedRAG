6.7 The share of expenditure on health in the total expenditure on social services, has increased from 21 per cent  in  FY19  to  26  per  cent  in  FY23  (BE).  The  National  Health  Policy,  2017 envisages as its goal ' the attainment of the highest possible level of health and well-being for all at all ages, through a preventive and promotive healthcare orientation in all developmental policies, and universal access to good quality healthcare services without anyone having to face financial hardship as a consequence. This would be achieved through increasing access, improving  quality,  and  lowering  the  cost  of  healthcare  delivery.' Accordingly,  the  policy recommended an increase in the Government's health expenditure from the existing 1.2 per cent to 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2025. Also, the Fifteenth Finance Commission, in its report, had recommended that public health expenditure of Union and States together should be increased in a progressive manner to reach 2.5 per cent of GDP by 2025 (FFC report, para 9.41, iii) . In keeping with this objective, Central and State Governments' budgeted expenditure on the health sector reached 2.1 per cent of GDP in FY23 (BE) and 2.2 per cent in FY22 (RE), against 1.6 per cent in FY21.
