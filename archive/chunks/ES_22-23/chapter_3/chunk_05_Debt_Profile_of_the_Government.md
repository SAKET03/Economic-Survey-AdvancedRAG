# Debt Profile of the Government

Debt Profile of the Government

3.34  Given the unprecedented fiscal expansion in 2020, rising government liabilities have emerged as a significant concern across the globe. IMF projects 9 the global government debt at 91 per cent of GDP in 2022, about 7.5 percentage points above the pre-pandemic levels. While countries worldwide had started winding up the fiscal support provided during the pandemic, challenging global financial conditions amidst global uncertainties tightened budget constraints. 10  Some European economies are expanding their budgets to provide relief to households and small businesses from mounting energy bills (Figure III.13). All these factors, together with rising interest rates and the fear of slower growth, make the sustainability of sovereign debts a concern worldwide.

3.35  It is crucial to analyse India's government debt profile against this global backdrop. For India, the total liabilities of the Union Government, which were relatively stable as a percentage of GDP over the past decade, witnessed a sharp spike in the pandemic year FY21. This spike in  debt  resulted  from  the  pandemic-induced  higher  Government  borrowings  to  finance  the additional expenditure needs, given the strained revenues and sharp contraction in the GDP. Total liabilities of the Union Government moderated from 59.2 per cent of GDP in FY21 to 56.7 per cent in FY22 (P) (Figure III.14). A brief description of the major components of the total liabilities of the Union Government is given in Table III.9.

Stable debt profile with relatively low currency and interest rate risk

3.36  India's public debt profile is relatively stable and is characterised by low currency and interest rate risks. During his speech at the South Centre in Geneva (April 2018), former RBI Governor Dr YV Reddy said, 'since most of India's public debt is held by the residents and denominated in domestic currency. I would, therefore, be less dogmatic on the fiscal deficit and public debt numbers and more emphatic about the context.' Of the Union Government's total net liabilities in end-March 2021, 95.1 per cent were denominated in domestic currency, while  sovereign  external  debt  constituted  4.9  per  cent,  implying  low  currency  risk  (Figure III.15). Further, sovereign external debt is entirely from official sources, which insulates it from volatility in the international capital markets.

3.37.      Public debt in India is primarily contracted at fixed interest rates, with floating internal debt constituting only 1.7 per cent of GDP in end-March 2021. The debt portfolio is, therefore, insulated from interest rate volatility, which also provides stability to interest payments. The weighted average maturity of the outstanding stock of dated securities of the government has increased from 9.7 years in end-March 2010 to 11.71 years in end-March 2022, thus reducing

the rollover risk in the medium-term (Figure III.16). Over the last few years, the proportion of dated securities maturing in less than five years has declined, whereas long-term securities have shown an increasing trend.

## consolidating General government finances

3.38. The General Government finances give an overview of fiscal position of the Government sector  as  a  whole.  Figure  III.17  shows  the  trends  in  General  Government  debt  and  deficits over the past few years. The General Government liabilities as a proportion of GDP increased steeply during FY21 on account of the additional borrowings made by Centre and States on account of the pandemic. However, the ratio has come off its peak in FY22 (RE). The General Government deficits as a per cent of GDP have also consolidated after their peak in F21. The General Government is expected to follow the path of fiscal consolidation in the medium term.

## A positive growth-interest rate differential keeps the Government Debt sustainable

3.39. The emphasis on capex in recent years is expected to boost GDP growth directly, and indirectly through multiplier effects on private consumption expenditure and private investment. Higher GDP growth would thereby facilitate buoyant revenue collection in the medium term, and thereby enable a sustainable fiscal path. The General Government Debt to GDP ratio increased from 75.7 per cent of end-March 2020 to 89.6 per cent at the end of the pandemic year FY21. It is estimated to decline to 84.5 per cent of GDP by end-March 2022. The emphasis on capexled growth will enable India to keep the growth-interest rate differential positive. As shown in Figure III.18 below, this differential has historically been positive for India. A positive growthinterest rate differential keeps the debt levels sustainable. Box III.5 shows that steady economic growth will accelerate fiscal consolidation in the economy.

3.40. A comparison of the change in General Government debt to GDP ratio from 2005 to 2021 across the countries highlights a substantial increase for most countries. For India, this increase is  modest, from 81 per cent of GDP in 2005 to around 84 per cent of GDP in 2021 (Figure III.19). It has been possible on the back of resilient economic growth during the last 15 years leading to a positive growth-interest rate differential, which, in turn, has resulted in sustainable Government debt to GDP levels.

## Box III.5: Sustained growth as the path to fiscal consolidation

The high fiscal deficit to GDP ratio witnessed in the aftermath of the pandemic is a concern for countries worldwide. A solution to the increased fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios lies in persistently high growth for a few years. A simple counterfactual experiment shows that sustained growth of 10 per cent per annum would have resulted in much lower Union Government deficit and debt ratios for India in the post-pandemic years, despite keeping the expenditure levels the same.

Under Scenario 1, the impact of a higher nominal GDP growth is evaluated on fiscal deficit and debt ratios, keeping the revenues and expenditures the same as actual. A counterfactual nominal GDP is estimated, assuming a growth rate of 10 per cent each year from FY20 to FY22. The actual Central Government fiscal deficit as a per cent of the counterfactual GDP is estimated as 4.5 per cent in FY20, 8 per cent in FY21, and 6.3 per cent in FY22, lower than the actual ratios observed (see rows (A) and (E) of Table 5A). Similarly, the ratio of Central Government debt to the estimated GDP is also lower than the actual debt-GDP ratio (see rows (B) and (F) of Table 5A).

However, higher GDP growth rate also impacts the fiscal deficit through higher revenues. Scenario 2 of the analysis incorporates the impact of higher GDP growth on the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio through the revenue channel. The expenditure levels were retained as actuals in the analysis. The actual  revenue  buoyancies  for  FY20  and  FY22  and  the  budgeted  revenue  buoyancy  for  FY21 were considered to quantify the impact of higher GDP growth on revenues. The budgeted revenue buoyancy was taken for FY21 because the actual buoyancy ratio could not be interpreted in the year of  nominal  GDP  contraction. The  fiscal  deficit  was  calculated  using  the  estimated  revenues  and actual expenditures for respective years. The estimated fiscal deficit as a proportion of GDP came out to be 4.2 for FY20, 6.2 for FY21, and 5.4 for FY22, much lower than the actual observed (see rows (C) and (E) of Table 5A).

Further, we see in scenario 3 that by taking the previous 5-year average revenue buoyancy for FY21 instead of the budgeted buoyancy and retaining actual revenue buoyancies for FY20 and FY22, the fiscal deficit to GDP ratio is still lower than the actual observed (see rows (D) and (E) of Table 5A).

The  messages  from  this  counterfactual  exercise  are  simple:  even  moderate  growth,  if  sustained, will support fiscal consolidation in the medium run and result in sustainable public finances. Two, India's public debt and deficit ratios went up sharply in recent years, not just on account of higher spending and lower tax revenues due to the pandemic but also due to the denominator undershooting trends resulting from financial system stress, followed by the pandemic. With both out of the way, nominal growth should return to its trend path, and hence, fiscal parameters would begin to show improvement. There is a need for continued vigilance and adherence to the path of fiscal prudence, but an undue alarm is unwarranted.
