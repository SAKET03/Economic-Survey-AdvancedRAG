- 5.1 Rising prices are always a cause of concern for policymakers as they hurt the common man the most. The perils of inflation are felt more in developing economies, where necessities have a higher share in the consumption basket than in developed countries. In recent years, India's inflation rate has been well-behaved, lying tamely below the RBI target rate of 4 per cent from 2017 to 2019.
- 5.2 In 2020, supply-side disruptions pushed inflation beyond the RBI's upper tolerance limit of 6 per cent. The pandemic delivered a larger shock on supply than it did on demand, through supply-chain disruptions in the case of essential goods, food, medicine and industrial goods. In turn, this aggravated cost-push inflation in the country.
- 5.3 As the pandemic receded, the conflict in Russia-Ukraine broke out, bringing in its wake worldwide inflation, fuelled mostly by surging prices of crude oil and other commodities. Prices soared to a decadal high and ate into household budgets, in turn prodding Central Banks to tighten monetary policy. A convalescing world economy was left to confront unprecedented rates of inflation. The spectre of stagflation loomed large on the horizon. In response, developed economies were left with no option but to raise interest rates. As the US Federal Reserve raised rates, the US dollar appreciated, making dollar-denominated fuel imports even dearer.
- 5.4 In advanced economies, the rate of inflation is projected by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to increase from 3.1 per cent in 2021 to 7.2 per cent in 2022, the highest since 1982. The Euro area saw the rate reach 10.0 per cent in September 2022 (WEO, October 2022 1 ). The US inflation reached its 40-year high at 9.1 per cent in June 2022 before moderating to 6.5 per cent in December 2022, while the UK saw an annual price rise of 9.2 per cent in December 2022. Germany witnessed inflation  of  8.6  per  cent  in  December  2022. Among  emerging  markets, Brazil saw a moderation in price trends, while Turkey's inflation was above 80 per cent from August to November 2022 before declining slightly to 64.3 per cent in December 2022. The war had compounded the effects of a strong recovery in demand for goods and services after the pandemic. The inflation rate in Emerging Markets and Developing Economies (EMDEs) is  anticipated  to  have  increased  from  5.9  per  cent  in  2021  to  9.9  per  cent  in  2022  (WEO, October 2022).

- 5.5 The groundwork for the commendable inflation management in India was laid earlier as fiscal and monetary measures adopted to stave off the pandemic-induced economic woes were prudent and well-calibrated. India chose not to overstimulate, and hence price pressures due to

the Russia-Ukraine conflict could be contained. Excessive heat in summer and uneven rainfall thereafter in some parts of the country affected the farm sector, reducing supply and causing prices of some major products to rise. India's inflation rate peaked in April 2022 at 7.8 per cent before moderating to 5.7 per cent in December 2022 on the back of good monsoons as well as prompt government measures that ensured adequate food supply. Global economic slowdown and interest rate increases brought down commodity prices, contributing to a substantial decline in wholesale price inflation. Thus, input price pressures on Indian manufacturers abated.

- 5.6 Even as inflation abated at the wholesale level, there has been a pass-through of previously high input costs onto retail prices. Core inflation remains sticky at nearly 6 per cent and reflects the second-round effects of the supply shocks witnessed earlier this year. Further, with the recovery of demand, there has been a pickup in service inflation. Against this backdrop, we discuss trends and drivers  of  retail  and  wholesale  price  inflation  in  FY22  and  FY23,  state-wise  and  ruralurban differential in consumer inflation, fuel price inflation, CPI and WPI convergence, housing prices, pharmaceutical pricing and fiscal as well as monetary policy measures undertaken to contain inflation as the chapter proceeds.
