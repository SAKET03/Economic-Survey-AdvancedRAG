# Fuel Price Inflation: Declining Global Crude Oil Prices

Fuel Price Inflation: Declining Global Crude Oil Prices

5.23  In  FY22  and  FY23,  inflation  in  WPI  'fuel  and  power'  was  mostly  driven  by  high international  crude  oil  prices.  In  response  to  subdued  global  demand  because  of  Covid-19 induced restrictions, the price of the Indian basket of crude oil during FY21 stayed in the range of US$20-65/bbl. Thereafter, prices started surging on account of unprecedented cuts in crude oil  supply by the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other oilproducing countries. The upward trend continued in FY22 and FY23, as demand picked up with the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in most regions of the world. Also, owing to supply disruption amid rising tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East in June 2022, the Indian basket of crude oil peaked at US$116/bbl. Subsequently, the price declined to US$ 78/bbl in December 2022. Further, a cut in central excise duty on petrol and diesel in November 2021 and May 2022, followed by a reduction in Value Added Tax (VAT) by the State Governments, led to a moderation of the retail selling price of petrol and diesel in India.
