# Falling Inflationary Expectation

Falling Inflationary Expectations

5.27  Inflationary  expectations  are  decisive  in  charting  the  course  of  inflation.  The  RBI's anchoring  of  inflationary  expectations  through  forward  guidance  and  responsive  monetary policy has helped guide the trajectory of inflation in the country. The one-year-ahead inflationary expectations by businesses have shown a decreasing trend in the current fiscal. As businesses are price-setters, their perceptions on inflation are significant in making sense of whether costs would be passed on, resulting in higher prices in the near future. Similarly, inflationary expectations by households- who are the price takers of the economy- determine their consumption choices in the near future. Much like businesses, household inflation expectations too have moderated.

## Box V.3: How is the Current Inflation Different from the 1970s?

Unprecedented global inflation in the current year recalls the experience of the 1970's, particularly the aftermath of the oil crises in 1973 and 1979. Both crises contributed to rising commodity prices worldwide  and  their  spill-over  effects  on  the  prices  of  other  goods  and  services.  However,  the environment and intensity of the crises differ in various respects.

Firstly ,  recent  oil  price  rises  are  proportionally  smaller  than  the  1970s  crisis,  which  had  taken  oil prices to historic highs.

Secondly , in contrast to the 1970s crisis, which was confined to oil prices, the recent crisis has seen pervasive  price  increases  across  a  broader  range  of  commodities.  Prices  of  non-oil  energy,  some agricultural goods, fertilisers, and metals have all risen well above their pre-pandemic levels in the current year.

Thirdly , commodity supply disruptions have played a smaller role in recent price increases than in the 1970s. The rise in commodity prices over the past year has been accompanied by a modest rise in the production of many commodities, although not oil. Global commodity supply chains have now become more efficient than in the 1970s and hence, the inflationary pressure can be absorbed with greater ease. However, supply disruptions could intensify over the coming year, as the war in Ukraine will lower global production of wheat, maize and fertilisers, while price caps on Russian oil and gas may reduce the supply of these products.

Fourthly , global inflation, which has risen significantly since the start of 2021, follows several years of low inflation. In contrast to this, the 1973 crisis took place against a backdrop of several years of steadily rising world inflation and signs of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.

Lastly ,  the 1973 crisis closely followed the collapse of the Bretton Woods managed exchange rate regime as the goals and even instruments of monetary policy were poorly defined in many countries. Arguably, central banks have much clearer and more robust institutional frameworks that focus on price stability today. This has prevented inflation expectations of the public from becoming unanchored despite a sharp rise in inflation during the year 2022.

Besides commodity market behaviour, higher energy prices could matter less today than in the past. With better coordination among the global central banks and the application of unconventional monetary policy tools, inflation has been controlled in a better way so that its negative spillovers are limited and transitory. The energy intensity of GDP - the amount of energy required to produce a given amount of goods and services - has fallen by around 40 per cent since the late 1970s. With the diversification of input baskets and destinations for sourcing, commodity shocks' impact has been tamed to some extent. Hence, we may expect recent commodity price rises to be less disruptive than those of the 1970s.

## Housing Prices: Recovering Housing Sector After the Pandemic

- 5.29  Housing prices provide helpful information on the state of the economy via booms and busts in asset markets, which give rise to economic imbalances. Monitoring housing prices is essential for achieving the objectives of price stability, financial stability, and growth.  Movements in these prices affect consumption spending through its effects on household wealth and consumer confidence.
- 5.30  The National Housing Bank (NHB) publishes two Housing Price Indices (HPI), namely 'HPI  assessment  price'  and  'HPI  market  price  quarterly',  with  FY18  as  the  base  year.  HPI assessment price is based on the valuation prices of residential units collected from primary lending institutions. In contrast, the HPI market price is based on the market prices for unsold inventories collected from developers. A composite index is calculated for 50 cities across India using the population of the cities as weights.
- 5.31  The annual variation in HPI market price ranged from an increase of 37.7 per cent in Bhubaneshwar to a contraction of 6.5 per cent in Indore in the Quarter Ending (QE) Sept 22 over QE Sept 21. Out of the 50 cities, 43 saw an increase in the index, whereas 7 cities showed a decline annually. All of the eight major metros of the country, viz., Ahmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and Pune, recorded increases in the index on an annual basis.
- 5.32  The annual change in HPI assessment price varied widely across the cities ranging from an increase of 20.2 per cent in Gandhinagar to a decline of 2.3 per cent in Bhiwadi in the QE Sept 22 over QE Sept 21. Out of the 50 cities, 46 cities registered an increase in the index, whereas 4 cities experienced a decline, on an annual basis. All of the eight major metros of the country witnessed an annual increase in the index.

5.33  The  Covid-19  crisis  significantly  impacted  the  residential  real  estate  market.  Health concerns  and  stay-at-home  orders  led  to  fewer  buyers  looking  for  homes  during  the  initial phase of the pandemic in April-June, 2020. Subsequently, India's real estate industry gained momentum from September 2020 onwards and peaked in the quarter ending in March 2021. The second wave of the pandemic affected the real estate sector yet again when home buyers delayed  purchases  due  to  mounting  uncertainty  and  restricted  movement.  However,  timely policy intervention by the government coupled with low home loan interest rates propped up demand and attracted buyers more readily in the affordable segment in FY23.  The overall increase in composite HPI assessment and HPI market prices indicates a revival in the housing finance sector. A stable to moderate increase in HPI also offers confidence to homeowners and home loan financiers in terms of the retained value of the asset.

## Box V.4: NHBs Support to the Housing Finance Sector (HFC)

The last three years were challenging for the housing sector. NHB has provided a significant impetus to obviate the liquidity issues faced by the Housing Finance Sector in the last 3 years.

-  The  Liquidity  Infusion  Facility  Scheme  was  launched  in  2019  to  support  HFCs  in  creating individual housing loan portfolios that fall under the priority sector, as defined by the RBI.
-  During the COVID-19 pandemic, Special Refinance Facility (SRF) was launched for disbursing an amount of ` 10,000 crore provided by RBI under the Special Liquidity Facility and an amount of ` 5,000 crore allocated by RBI under an Additional Special Liquidity Facility.
-  During 2020-21, SRF 2021 was launched with a corpus of ` 10,000 crore provided by RBI under SLF-2. NHB has provided refinance disbursement of ` 3.3 lakh crore since inception, of which ` 0.84 lakh crore were disbursed during last 3 financial years.
-  Also, as a part of the Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav (AKAM), NHB has extended concessions of 25/30 basis points under refinance for the various categories including women, rural areas, SC/ ST,  aspirational  districts,  north-eastern  region,  loans  to  third  gender/differently  abled/disabled, UTs of Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Ladakh, and green housing.

-  In  view  of  the  nation's  commitment  at  COP26  to  reach  net-zero  emission  by  2070,  NHB  has extended 100 bps concession for loans under Green Housing.
-  As  part  of AKAM  and  to  increase  the  credit  offtake  in  geographically  underpenetrated  areas which are a national priority, NHB has decided to extend 100 bps concession and refinance for loans in designated aspirational districts, north-eastern States, Jammu &amp; Kashmir and Ladakh, until September 2023.

## Keeping check on Phamaceutical Prices

5.34  The  principles  for  the  regulation  of  the  prices  of  drugs  are  based  on  the  National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Policy, 2012, administered by the Department of Pharmaceuticals. The key principles of the policy are the essentiality of drugs, control of formulation prices and market-based pricing. Until 31 December 2022, ceiling prices for 890 formulations of 358 drugs/medicines across various therapeutic categories under National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM), 2015 have been fixed by National Pharmaceuticals Pricing Authority. Subsequently,  NLEM  2022  was  promulgated  by  Ministry  of  Health  and  Family  Welfare in September 2022 and revised Schedule I of Drugs (Prices Control) Order (DPCO) was notified  on  11  November  2022  by  Department  of  Pharmaceuticals  incorporating  NLEM, 2022.  Ceiling  prices  of  119  formulations  under  NLEM,  2022  have  been  fixed  until  31 December 2022. In addition, retail prices for 2,196 formulations have been fixed under the DPCO, 2013.

5.35  Pradhan Mantri Bhartiya Janaushadhi Pariyojana (PMBJP) was launched to make quality generic medicines available at affordable prices to all. Under this scheme, dedicated outlets known as Janaushadhi Kendras are opened to provide quality generic medicines at affordable prices  to  all  and  especially  to  the  poor  and  the  deprived.  Further,  Pradhan  Mantri  Bhartiya Janaushadhi  Kendras  (PMBJKs)  also  provide  self-employment  with  sustainable  and  regular earnings opportunities. Under the PMBJP, until 31 December 2022, more than 9000 PMBJKs have been opened across the country. At present, the product basket of PMBJP comprises 1759 medicines and 280 surgical devices available for sale.
