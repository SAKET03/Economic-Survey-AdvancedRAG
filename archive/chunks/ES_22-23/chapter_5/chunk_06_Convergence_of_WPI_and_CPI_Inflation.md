# Convergence of WPI and CPI Inflation

Convergence of WPI and CPI Inflation

5.24  Inflation dynamics in India since the outbreak of the pandemic have been influenced by various domestic and global factors. While the pass-through of international prices to wholesale prices is relatively quick, it impacts retail prices with a lag. This creates a wedge between WPI and CPI inflation rates. It is also due to the difference in composition and weights assigned to different commodities in the two indices.

5.25  The headline inflation based on WPI and the CPI-C started diverging in March 2021, as WPI inflation  touched  double  digits  due  to  unfavourable  base  effects  while  CPI-C  inflation remained  stable.  The  wedge  between  CPI-C  and  WPI  inflation  continued  to  widen  before reaching its peak at 10 per cent in November 2021. Thereafter, the gap began to narrow until April 2022. The path to convergence, however, was short-lived as another inflationary pressure started building up in February 2022 as a consequence of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. The major brunt of commodity supply chain disruption and increased demand for essentials was reflected in WPI with a short lag of 2 months. As a result, the two indicators of inflation again started diverging in May 2022. It was only after global commodity prices, including crude oil, softened and the effects of strong supporting domestic factors like favourable monsoon, vaccination-led economic resumption, etc., started to be felt that the wedge began to narrow, and it closed in November 2022, after 21 months. It also indicated the near completion of the pass-through of high input costs to the retail segment.

5.26  The convergence between the WPI and CPI indices was mainly driven by two factors. Firstly,  a  cooling  in  inflation  of  commodities  such  as  crude  oil,  iron,  aluminium  and  cotton led to a lower WPI. These commodities occupy a larger weight in the WPI as compared to the CPI. Further, these commodities are highly vulnerable to fluctuations in international prices and

are used intensively by industries producing wholesale goods. As the prices cooled for these commodities, the two measures of inflation began to converge. Secondly, CPI inflation rose due to an increase in the prices of services. Services form a part of the core component of the CPI-C but are not included in the WPI basket.
