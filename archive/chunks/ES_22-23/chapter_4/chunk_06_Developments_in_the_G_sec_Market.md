Developments in the G-sec Market

4.11  After remaining steady through 2020 and 2021, the yield on the 10-year government bond rose in 2022. The weighted average yield spike reflects the domestic bond market volatility stemming from uncertainty in crude prices, a hawkish stance of major central banks, a hardening of global bond yield and the pressure on the rupee. The monthly average yield on the 10-year government bond stood at 7.3 per cent in December 2022 after having peaked at 7.5 per cent in June 2022. Yields moderated in November and December 2022 following smaller rate hikes by major central banks and declining inflation. With the softening of yields, volatility also declined in the second half of 2022.
