# MSP to Ensure Returns Over the Cost of Production

MsP to ensure returns over the cost of Production

8.4 The Union Budget for 2018-19 announced that farmers in India would be given an MSP of at least one and a half times the cost of production. Accordingly, the Government has been increasing the MSP for all 22 Kharif, Rabi and other commercial crops with a margin of at least 50 per cent over the all-India weighted average cost of production since the agricultural year 2018-19. Given nutritional requirements and changing dietary patterns and to achieve selfsufficiency in pulses and oilseeds production, the Government has fixed relatively higher MSP for pulses and oilseeds.
