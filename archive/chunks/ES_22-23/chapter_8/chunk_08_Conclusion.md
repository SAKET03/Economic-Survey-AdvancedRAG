conclusion to the farmer's satisfaction. Along with this, the redressal of complaints within the prescribed time limits is monitored through the portal by the concerned State  and  Central  Government  officials.  The  Beta  version  of  the  portal  was  launched  in Chhattisgarh on 21st July 2022.
- Further, a provision of Stratified Grievance Redressal Mechanism, viz. District Level Grievance  Redressal  Committee  (DGRC),  State  Level  Grievance  Redressal  Committee (SGRC) has been made in the Revised Operational Guidelines of the Scheme to resolve such complaints.
- 8.15  Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture (MIDH): Several expert groups have identified horticulture as a high-growth area and a source of buoyant income and improved resilience for farmers. The scheme to promote horticulture covering fruits, vegetables, root and tuber crops, spices, flowers, plantation crops etc., was introduced in 2014-15. The interventions include introducing improved varieties and quality seeds, incentives for plantation crops, cluster development, and post-harvest management. According to third advance estimates (2021-22), a record production of 342.3 million tonnes in an area of 28.0 million hectares was achieved. The government has identified 55 horticulture clusters, of which 12 have been selected for the Cluster Development Programme (CDP) pilot phase. This programme is designed to leverage the geographical specialisation of horticulture clusters and promote integrated and market-led development  of  pre-production,  production  and  post-harvest  activities,  including  the  entire supply chain.
- 8.16  National  Agriculture  Market  (e-NAM)  Scheme:  The  Government  of  India  launched the  National Agriculture  Market  (e-NAM)  Scheme  in  2016  to  create  an  online  transparent, competitive bidding system to ensure farmers get remunerative prices for their produce. Under

the e-NAM Scheme, the Government provides free software and assistance of â‚¹75 lakh per APMC mandi for related hardware, including quality assaying equipment and the creation of infrastructure like cleaning, grading, sorting, packaging, compost unit, etc. As on 31 December 2022, more than 1.7 crore farmers and 2.3 lakh traders have been registered on e-NAM portal

8.17  Climate-Smart Farming Practices: This is slowly gaining acceptance with farmers using clean energy sources like solar for irrigation. The farmers have been incentivised to transfer electricity generated through solar to the local grid. Crop yield prediction models using artificial intelligence and drones for monitoring soil and crop health have been initiated. Smart farming also enables crop diversification, which will help farmers reduce their dependence on monsoons for water. There are over 1,000 agritech start-ups in India. These assist farmers in improving farming techniques  3 .

The United Nations General Assembly, in its 75th session during March 2021, declared 2023 the International Year of Millets (IYM). Millets are Smart Food with high nutritional value, are  climate  resilient,  and  align  with  several  UN  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs). These are also important by virtue of their mammoth potential to generate livelihood, increase farmers' income and ensure food &amp; nutritional security all over the world.

India produces more than 50.9 million tonnes (as per fourth advance estimate) of millet which accounts for 80 per cent of Asia's and 20 per cent of global production. The global average yield is 1229 kg/ha, whereas India has a higher average yield of 1239 kg/ha. In India, millets are  primarily  a  Kharif  crop  mostly  grown  in  rainfed  conditions,  requiring  less  water  and agricultural inputs than other staple crops.

Given the nutritional value of the millets, the Government notified Millets as Nutri-cereals in April 2018. Under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM), millets have been introduced to  provide  nutritional  support. A  sub-mission  on  Nutri-cereals  is  being  implemented  since 2018-19 in 212 districts of 14 States.

India  has  more  than  500  start-ups  working  in  the  millet  value  chains,  while  the  Indian Institute  of  Millets  Research  has  incubated  250  start-ups  under  Rashtriya  Krishi  Vikas Yojana - Remunerative Approaches for Agriculture and Allied Sectors Rejuvenation (RKVYRAFTAAR).
