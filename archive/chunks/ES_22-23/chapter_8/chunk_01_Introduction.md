Introduction

- 8.1 With its solid forward linkages, the agriculture and allied activities sector significantly contributed to the country's overall growth and development by ensuring food security. The Indian agriculture sector has been growing at an average annual growth rate of 4.6 per cent during the last six years.  It grew by 3.0 per cent in 2021-22 compared to 3.3 per cent in 202021. In recent years, India has also rapidly emerged as the net exporter of agricultural products. In  2020-21, exports of agriculture and allied products from India grew by 18 per cent over the previous year.  During 2021-22, agricultural exports reached an all-time high of US$ 50.2 billion.  This period of buoyant performance could be ascribed to the measures taken by the Government  to  promote  farmer-producer  organisations,  encourage  crop  diversification,  and improve productivity in agriculture through support provided for mechanisation and the creation of the Agriculture Infrastructure Fund. Thus, enabling the country, in the spirit of Vasudhaiva

Kutumbakam, to provide necessary and essential support to other countries for the losses faced during Covid-19. Further, income support to farmers through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the promotion of allied activities has led to diversification in sources of farmers' income, improving their resilience to weather shocks.

8.2 The interventions of the Government have been in line with the recommendations of the Committee on Doubling Farmers' Income, which had identified improvement in crop and livestock productivity,  diversification  towards  higher  value  crops,  better  resource  efficiency,  enhanced cropping intensity, improvement in real prices received by farmers and shift from farm to nonfarm occupations as being significant sources of growth. Several policy measures, such as the Minimum Support Price (MSP) to secure the price at one and half times the all-India weighted average cost of production, schemes and price measures to focus on high-value added crops such as  oilseed,  incentives  for  crop  diversification  through  price  policy  measures,  improvements  in agricultural marketing and by enhancing resource use efficiency etc. have been adopted. While Indian agriculture has performed well, the sector needs re-orientation in the backdrop of certain challenges like adverse impacts of climate change, fragmented landholdings, sub-optimal farm mechanisation, low productivity, disguised unemployment, rising input costs, etc.

Various policy initiatives introduced and implemented to deal with these issues are discussed later in this chapter.
