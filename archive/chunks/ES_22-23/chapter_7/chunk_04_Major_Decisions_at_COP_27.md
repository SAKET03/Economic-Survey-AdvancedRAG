major decisions at CoP 27

7.56  The COP 27 to the UNFCCC was held from 6 to 20 November 2022 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. In conjunction with COP 27, the 17 th Session of the Conference of Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (CMP17), the 4th Session of the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of Parties to Paris Agreement (CMA4), 57th session of the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA) and the Subsidiary Body for Implementation (SBI) were also held.

- 7.57  India participated in COP 27, with a focus on mainstreaming the theme of LiFE - Lifestyle for Environment. The Indian Pavilion at COP 27 highlighted the theme of LiFE in various ways - models, audio-visual displays, activities, and 49 side events. India invited all countries to join the LiFE movement, which is a pro-people and pro-planet effort seeking to shift the world from mindless and wasteful consumption to mindful and deliberate utilisation of natural resources.
- 7.58  The cover decision of COP 27, titled the Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan, notes the 'importance of the transition to sustainable lifestyles and sustainable patterns of consumption and production for efforts to address climate change'. Other decisions were setting up the Just Transition and Mitigation Work Program and the agreement on Joint work on the implementation of climate action on agriculture and food security to be conducted over four years.
- 7.59  During COP 27, developing nations strongly voiced setting up a separate fund for loss and damage. After negotiations, it was decided to establish new funding arrangements for assisting developing countries that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change in responding to loss and damage, with a focus on addressing loss and damage. A transitional committee has been established to work out the modalities.

7.60  Other  substantive  elements  covered  in  the  Sharm  el-Sheikh  Implementation  Plan  are the importance of science in guiding climate action, doubling adaptation finance, dialogue on making finance flows consistent with low-emissions, and climate-resilient development calls on  Multilateral  Development  Banks  (MDB)  reform  for  delivering  climate  finance  at  scale; diversity of sources of finance (including new and additional finance), etc. COP 27 also saw progress on adaptation, with governments agreeing on how to move forward on the Global Goal on Adaptation, which will conclude at COP 28 and inform the first Global Stocktake in 2023.

7.61  Lastly, during COP 27, it was also recognised that the target of US$ 100 billion per year is yet to be achieved. The COP 21 decided that, prior to 2025, a New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance from a floor of US$ 100 billion per year, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing countries, shall be set. To further the agenda of setting the NCQG by 2024, COP 27 decided that Four Technical Expert Dialogues (TEDs) will be carried out prior to COP 28.

## india's initiatives at the international Stage

## international Solar alliance (iSa)

7.62  The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is a treaty-based inter-governmental organisation working to create a global market system to tap the benefits of solar power and promote clean energy applications. ISA's mission is to unlock US$ 1 trillion of investments in solar by 2030 while reducing the cost of the technology and its financing. With the signing and ratification of the ISA Framework Agreement by 15 countries on 6 December 2017, ISA became the first international intergovernmental organisation to be headquartered in India.  ISA is partnering with multilateral development banks (MDBs), development financial institutions (DFIs), private and public sector organisations, civil society, and other international institutions to deploy costeffective and transformational solutions through solar energy, especially in the least Developed Countries (LDCs) and the Small Island Developing States (SIDS).

7.63  The ISA has expanded its coverage to all its 110 member countries. It assists them with the adoption of solar energy with the view to improving energy access, ensuring energy security and facilitating the energy transition. Through the programmatic support offered by ISA, a pipeline of 9.5 GW of solar energy capacity has been identified in its member countries, including largescale  solar  parks  in  multiple  developing  countries.  In  its  member  countries,  with  a  grant  of US$ 50,000, ISA is  assisting  in  setting  up  solar  energy  demonstration  projects.  Three  such demonstration projects were inaugurated at the Fifth Assembly of ISA.

## Coalition for disaster resilient infrastructure

7.64  The CDRI was launched by the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India during the United Nations Climate Action Summit on 23 September 2019 in New York. It is a global partnership of National Governments, UN agencies and programmes, multilateral development banks and financing mechanisms, the private sector, and academic and knowledge institutions. It aims to promote the resilience of infrastructure systems to climate and disaster risks, thereby ensuring sustainable development.

7.65  As  on  29  June  2022,  thirty-one  Countries,  six  International  Organisations  and  two private sector organisations have joined as members of CDRI.  CDRI has been expanding its membership  consistently  by  attracting  a  wide  variety  of  economically  advanced  countries, developing countries, and countries that are most vulnerable to climate change and disasters. Over a period, a network of organisations/stakeholders will be developed to advance disasterresilient infrastructure not only in India but in other partner countries as well.

## leadership group for industry transition (leadit)

7.66  The LeadIT gathers countries and companies that are committed to action to achieve the Paris Agreement. It was launched by the governments of Sweden and India at the UN Climate Action Summit in September 2019 and is supported by the World Economic Forum. LeadIT members subscribe to the notion that energy-intensive industries can and must progress on lowcarbon pathways, aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.

7.67  During COP 27, LeadIT members adopted a joint statement wherein members collectively agreed to:

- (i) promote value chain partnerships and material circularity;
- (ii) invest  and  cooperate  on  the  planning  and  implementation  of  infrastructure  to  support energy and industry transitions;
- (iii) give multilateral development banks and multilateral climate funds mandates to de-risk investments in the transition of heavy industries in emerging and developing countries;
- (iv) formulate  roadmaps  for  heavy  industry  sectors  that  include  regulatory  frameworks, incentives,  and  long-term  strategies,  to  facilitate  transition  finance  and  attract  private investments.
