While the country has low per capita carbon emissions, it is committed to pursuing low-carbon  growth.  However,  it  faces  challenges  in  deploying  renewable energy, particularly due to a lack of storage technology and access to minerals. Given  India's  vulnerability  to  climate  change,  a  strong  adaptation  strategy is  essential;  the  increase  in  adaptation  expenditures  from  3.7  per  cent  to  5.6 per cent of GDP between FY16 and FY22 indicates the prominence adaptation and  building  resilience  play  in  the  development  strategy.  The  Lifestyle  for Environment (LiFE) initiative, designed to encourage sustainable practices and circular economy, will play a transformative role in the development process. The flow of international finance has remained grossly inadequate, with much of the action being financed from domestic resources. The outcomes from the recent CoP29 hold little promise on that account.\n\n##",
