  "content": "Chapter 4 Summary:\nThe chapter discusses the dynamics of inflation, particularly in the context of India and the global economy. It highlights that global inflation peaked at 8.7% in 2022 due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions but has since declined. In India, retail inflation eased in FY25 due to government and Reserve Bank of India interventions, with core inflation reaching its lowest point in a decade. Food inflation remains a challenge, driven by supply chain disruptions, adverse weather conditions, and price pressures in vegetables and pulses. The chapter emphasizes the need for robust data systems, climate-resilient crops, and policy measures to ensure long-term price stability. Key statistics include: global inflation at 5.7% in 2024, India's retail inflation at 4.9% in FY25, food inflation at 4.3% when excluding vegetables and pulses, and the significant impact of extreme weather events on vegetable production and prices. The chapter concludes with policy recommendations to address inflationary pressures and ensure price stability.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# Global Inflation\n\nglobal inflation peaked in 2022 due to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, it has declined since then, aided by policy measures. In India, retail inflation eased in FY25 due to timely interventions by the government and the Reserve Bank of India. Core inflation reached its lowest point in a decade, while food inflation was affected by supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions.\n\nOnion and tomato prices are affected by the decline in production, partly due to extreme weather conditions and monsoon-induced supply chain disruptions. On pulses, despite being a major producer, India faces a gap in demand and supply. The government has undertaken several measures to rein in the prices of  vegetables  like  onion  and  tomato  which  included  procurement  and  buffer stocking of onion under price stabilisation fund and subsidised sale of onion and tomato. Also, many administrative measures have been taken-up to address the price pressures in pulses such as subsidised retail sale, stock limits and easing imports.\n\nEstimates suggest that India's retail price inflation will align progressively with the target. Global commodity prices are expected to decline, potentially easing core and food inflation. Long-term price stability could be achieved by robust data systems for monitoring prices, developing climate-resilient crops, reducing crop damage and post-harvest losses.\n\n##",
