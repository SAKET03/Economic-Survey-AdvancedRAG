  "content": "Chapter 9 Summary:\nThe agricultural sector in India has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23. The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, reassuring them of a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the use of drones and fertigation techniques to optimize fertilizer applications. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has been introduced to enable farmers to meet their short-term working capital requirements promptly and hassle-free. The government has also launched the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) to provide insurance for farmers against crop losses due to natural calamities, pests, and diseases. The agricultural extension services have been strengthened to disseminate knowledge, enhance productivity, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. The government has also promoted private investment in agricultural marketing infrastructure through initiatives such as the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme. The food processing industry in India is one of the largest employers within organized manufacturing, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated several key programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The government has also implemented various initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). India's agricultural sector remains a crucial pillar for economic growth and ensuring food security for the nation, with significant potential for growth and development.\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Rainfall and Irrigation System: Building Efficiency and Extending Coverage\n\nRAINFALL AND IRRIGATION SYSTEM: Building Efficiency and Extending Coverage\n\n9.14 Precipitation is  crucial  in  the  global  water  cycle,  serving  as  a  primary  source for  freshwater  replenishment,  vital  for  various  ecosystems  and  human  activities. The  repercussions  of  climate  change  on  rainfall  patterns  are  profound,  particularly concerning agricultural practices that rely heavily on consistent and predictable weather conditions (Porter et al., 2014) 13 .\n\n9.15 In India, while the volatility in agricultural growth has notably diminished over time due to targeted interventions, the sector remains highly vulnerable to weather\n\n12    Fertigation is a method of fertiliser application in which fertiliser is incorporated within the irrigation water by the drip system.\n\n13    Porter, J.

A substantial  portion  of  the  agricultural  land  relies  on  rain-fed  systems,  making  it especially  susceptible  to  fluctuations  in  precipitation.  Moreover,  more  than  twothirds of India's agricultural land faces the threat of drought, with national estimates indicating a 35 per cent probability of drought occurrences 15 . This risk is not uniform across the country; it varies considerably based on geographies. For instance, in dryhumid regions, the likelihood of drought is relatively lower at about 20 per cent, while in arid zones, it can exceed 40 per cent. Such disparities emphasise the urgent need for region-specific strategies to mitigate drought risk 16 .\n\n9.16   The  implications  of  erratic  monsoon  patterns  are  particularly  pronounced  for marginal and small-scale farmers, representing approximately 85 per cent of India's agricultural holdings. These farmers typically cultivate on plots less than 2 hectares in size, making them highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate variability. 17 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.17 Climate change is a problem because it accentuates weather variability. There has been an increase in the frequency of dry spells during the summer monsoon season, which are 27 per cent more common from 1981 to 2011 compared to 1951 to 1980 18 .\n\n14  Agriculture statistics at a glance 2022-23, Ministry of Agriculture.\n\n15  NABARD Climate Change and Risk Management in Indian Agriculture, 2022.\n\n- 16    Krishnan, R., Sanjay, J., Gnanaseelan, C., Mujumdar, M., Kulkarni, A., &amp; Chakraborty, S.

At the same time, there are also more intense short wet spells. In central India, the frequency of extreme daily rainfall events exceeding 150 mm has increased by about 75 per cent from 1950 to 2015 20 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.18 Several  studies  have  also  assessed  the  overall  effect  of  climate  change  on agricultural  production.  Negi  and  Ramaswami  (2024) 21   examined  the  relationship between crop yields and rainfall across India at the district level for nine key crops during  the  kharif  season.  They  found  a  strong  link  between  significant  rainfall shortfalls and substantial crop yield losses. This statistical phenomenon is known as lower tail dependence, indicating that the correlation between yield losses and rainfall deficits is stronger for extreme rainfall deficiencies than for minor variations. Other studies have indicated that a potential 2°C rise in annual temperature and a 7 per cent increase in annual rainfall by 2099 could lead to an 8-12 per cent decline in Indian agricultural  productivity 22 .  Birthal  et.al  (2021) 23 found  that  heat  stress  harmed  crop yield, which worsened over time. Most studies have suggested that droughts and heat waves negatively impact agricultural productivity compared to floods and cold waves in India. It is, therefore, pertinent to increase the area under irrigation and diversify towards heat and water-resistant crops.\n\n9.19 Between FY16 and FY21, India experienced a significant increase in irrigation area coverage and intensity. The coverage of irrigation area has increased between FY16 and FY21 from 49.3 per cent to 55 per cent of the gross cropped area (GCA), while irrigation intensity has risen from 144.2 per cent to 154.5 per cent. States such as Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Telangana exhibit high irrigation coverage of their gross cropped area, with figures around 98 per cent, 94 per cent, 84 per cent, and 86 per cent, respectively. In contrast, states like Jharkhand and Assam lag significantly, with irrigation coverage below 20 per cent, underscoring the necessity to improve irrigation\n\n21    Negi, D. S., &amp; Ramaswami, B.

Since  the  FY16  fiscal  year,  the government  has  been  implementing  the  Per  Drop  More  Crop  (PDMC)  initiative, a  component of the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY), to promote water  efficiency.  Financial  assistance  is  provided  at  55  per  cent  of  the  total  project cost for small and marginal farmers, and 45 per cent for other farmers for installation of micro irrigation under PDMC. From FY16 to FY25 (end of Dec. 2024), ₹ 21968.75 crore was released to states for implementation of PDMC Scheme and an area of 95.58 lakh ha has been covered under which is about 104.67 per cent higher as compared to the Pre-PDMC period. Further, in addition to PDMC the micro irrigation Fund (MIF)\n\nsupports innovatiove projects through 2 per cent interest subvention to states on loans availed  under  MIF.  Loans  amounting  to  ₹4709  crore  has  been  approved  of  which ₹3640 crore has been disbursed so far.\n\n9.21 The  Rain-fed  Area  Development  (RAD)  program  has  been  implemented  to develop  and  conserve  natural  resources  alongside  farming  systems  as  part  of  the National Mission for Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) since FY15. From FY22 onwards, the RAD scheme has been integrated into the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY). So far, ₹1,858.41 crore have been allocated, covering an area of 8.00 lakh hectares under the RAD program since its inception.\n\n9.22 According  to  a  study  by  the  A.T.E  Chandra  Foundation,  a  community-led, technology-enabled model for rejuvenating water bodies (RWB) across India can be an important intervention to enhance rural water security. The Composite Land-use Restoration and Assessment Tool (CLART GIS) and the AVNI Gramin app can identify water bodies with potential for groundwater recharge and enable monitoring of such interventions to restore water bodies through geo-tagged images and verification at the  farmer  level.  RWB could, therefore, be a cost-effective  solution  to  India's  water challenges, offering environmental, economic, and social benefits.\n\n## BOX IX.3 :  Micro-Irrigation: Unlocking the potential\n\nWater  scarcity  is  a  challenge  for  Indian  agriculture,  and  promoting  micro-irrigation  is extremely  important  in  reducing  the  water  footprint.  Micro-irrigation  holds  significant potential for India's 140 million hectares of arable land . Even though there is an increase in area under micro-irrigation in India (8 per cent of irrigated area), the pace is still slow as compared to the USA (68.6 per cent) and China (13.7 per cent). 24\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA study by (Narayanamoorthy et al,2024) 25  examined the impact of drip irrigation on five horticultural  crops-brinjal,  tomato,  banana,  watermelon,  and  mango-in  Tamil  Nadu, India. The study suggested that drip irrigation enhances agricultural outcomes. Compared to flood irrigation, it reduces water consumption by 39-55 per cent and boosts crop yields by 33-41 per cent due to targeted water delivery. This efficiency translates to substantial economic  benefits  for  farmers,  with  profit  margins  increasing  by  52.92-114.50  per  cent depending on the crop (e.g., brinjal, mango). In a similar vein, another study (D. Suresh Kumar et al, 2010) suggested that the drip irrigation method has demonstrated a substantial impact on resource conservation, reduction in cultivation costs, improved crop yields, and enhanced farm profitability 26 .\n\n##",
