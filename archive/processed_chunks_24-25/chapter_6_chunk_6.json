In FY25, capital expenditure gathered momentum post-elections, with a focus on sustainable construction practices and increasing private participation. The government has launched several initiatives, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), and PM GatiShakti, to promote infrastructure development. Key policy recommendations include increasing private participation, improving project conceptualization, and developing sector-specific strategies. The chapter highlights progress in physical connectivity, including railways, road transport, civil aviation, ports, and shipping. It also discusses digital connectivity, rural infrastructure, and urban infrastructure development. The government has introduced several initiatives to promote tourism infrastructure, space infrastructure, and sustainable development. The chapter concludes that continued infrastructure investment is crucial for sustaining high growth, and public-private partnerships are essential for meeting infrastructure requirements.\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Digital Connectivity\n\nDIGITAL CONNECTIVITY\n\n6.23 Digital connectivity has made  major  advancements  in  digital inclusion, technological innovation, and regulatory reforms this fiscal year, all in line with the government's vision for a Digital India.\n\n## Telecommunications\n\n6.24 The rollout of 5G services, along with the introduction of new policies aimed at enhancing telecommunications infrastructure and user experience, has played a crucial role in digital connectivity. By October 31, 2024, 5G services were launched in all states and union territories. Currently, 5G services are available in 779 out of 783 districts 10 . Over 4.6 lakh 5G Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) have been installed nationwide.\n\n6.25 In July 2022, the Union Cabinet approved a project to provide 4G mobile services to 24,680 uncovered villages in remote areas and upgrade 6,279 villages, which were then using 2G/3G networks. By December 2024, 7,815 sites covering 10,706 villages have been commissioned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n6.26 In  August  2024,  the  Universal  Service  Obligation  Fund,  providing  financial support for telecom services and subsidising mobile services, broadband connectivity and infrastructure  in  rural  and  remote  areas  was  rechristened  Digital  Bharat  Nidhi (DBN). The progress of activities supported under DBN is presented in Box VI.9.\n\n10    Ministry of Communications (2024, December 26) Year End Review 2024. Government of India.

Key efforts include:\n\n- Bharat Net Project to connect all Gram Panchayats and villages with broadband. As of December 2024, 6.92 lakh km of Optical Fibre Cable (OFC) has been laid, 2.14 lakh GPs are service-ready (including 5,032 via satellite, 12.04 lakh FTTH connections have been installed.\n- Comprehensive telecom development plan for north-eastern region:\n- Mobile  Services:  1,358  sites  providing  services  in  uncovered  villages  and  highways. Arunachal Pradesh and Assam: 671 towers cover 1,178 villages. Meghalaya: 433 towers cover 622 villages and 3 highways.\n\n## •  Telecom development for islands:\n\n-  Andaman &amp; Nicobar Islands: Submarine OFC connectivity completed, with 205 Gbps bandwidth utilised and satellite bandwidth increased from 2 Gbps to 4 Gbps.\n-  Lakshadweep Islands: Submarine OFC project (1,869 km) commissioned in January 2024, enabling 5G and FTTH services.\n\n## •  Mobile services in uncovered areas:\n\n- Border Villages Scheme: 319 villages covered with 4G (295 towers).\n-  LWE-Phase I &amp; II: 297 towers upgraded to 4G under Phase I. 1,106 towers commissioned under Phase II, covering 1,162 locations.\n\n## •  Aspirational districts scheme:\n\n- 502-Village  Scheme:  215  towers  commissioned,  covering  251  villages  across  112 districts in 4 states.\n- 7,287-Village Scheme: 2,497 sites commissioned, covering 3,804 villages in 5 states.\n\n## Information Technology\n\n6.27 The  GI  Cloud  initiative,  known  as  MeghRaj,  is  a  key  component  of  India's information technology strategy, aimed at delivering ICT services via cloud computing to  Central  and  State/UT  Departments.  As  of  November  30,  2024,  the  National Informatics  Centre  supports  1,917  applications  on  its  cloud.  The  government  has empanelled 23 public and private cloud service providers to address the cloud needs of user departments.\n\n## Box VI.10:  Capacity advancement in data centre\n\nIndia's  data  centre  market  is  witnessing  significant  growth,  fuelled  by  the  expansion  of infrastructure and a rising demand for digital services. The following literature provides evidence to support this trend:\n\n- India's colocation data centre capacity reached 977 MW 11 in 2023. Capacity of 258 MW\n\n11 Cushman &amp; Wakefield (2024, July). Potential for 5x capacity expansion to fuel digital transformation. https:// tinyurl.com/4w4x34a4.\n\nwas added in the year, reflecting a 105 per cent year-on-year growth. The total capacity under construction for 2024-2028 is 1.03 GW, with an additional 1.29 GW planned.\n\n- The  data  centre  market  in  India  is  expected  to  grow  from  US$4.5  billion  in  2023  to US$11.6 billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 10.98 per cent 12 .\n- India benefits from lower construction costs, owing to its well-established IT and digitally enabled services ecosystem, as well as relatively affordable real estate with a median of US$6.8 million per MW in 2023, compared to US$9.17 million in Australia, US$12.73 million in Japan, and US$11.23 million in Singapore 13 .\n\n##",
