In FY25, capital expenditure gathered momentum post-elections, with a focus on sustainable construction practices and increasing private participation. The government has launched several initiatives, including the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP), National Monetisation Pipeline (NMP), and PM GatiShakti, to promote infrastructure development. Key policy recommendations include increasing private participation, improving project conceptualization, and developing sector-specific strategies. The chapter highlights progress in physical connectivity, including railways, road transport, civil aviation, ports, and shipping. It also discusses digital connectivity, rural infrastructure, and urban infrastructure development. The government has introduced several initiatives to promote tourism infrastructure, space infrastructure, and sustainable development. The chapter concludes that continued infrastructure investment is crucial for sustaining high growth, and public-private partnerships are essential for meeting infrastructure requirements.\n\nSubchapter 1 Content:\n# Introduction\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n6.1 India's development aspirations require a substantial investment in infrastructure over the next decade.

Keeping this in view, the government has laid a special focus on infrastructure in the last five years. Reflecting this intent, the capital expenditure by the union government on major infrastructure sectors 4   has been increased at a trend rate of 38.8 per cent from FY20 to FY24.\n\n1     Asian Development Bank (2017).
