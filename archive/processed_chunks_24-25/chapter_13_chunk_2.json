The  increasing  complexity  of  the  models  being  developed today represent a paradigm shift in the field of AI, showing the world that in a few years, 'intelligent machines' will be capable of performing tasks that are predominantly handled by humans today. The founder of the AI research and deployment company OpenAI recently stated in a blog post how they are expecting to have office ready 'AI workers' by the end of 2025 1 .\n\n1   Reflections by Sam Altman. 6th January 2025, https://tinyurl.com/59t77hv4\n\n13.2 Expectations  point  toward  a  trend  where  AI  begins  outperforming  humans  in critical decision-making processes in areas like healthcare, criminal justice, education, business and financial services among others. Adding to the uncertainties of tomorrow is the fact that the speed of research and development is outpacing the regulatory and ethical  frameworks  needed  to  manage  its  risks.  Further,  with  executives  optimistic about the capabilities of AI 2 and the cost-saving potential they expect it to possess, the impact of AI on the labour market, particularly entry-level jobs is turning into a point of concern for policymakers. This economic displacement adds to a broader sense of unease about whether AI will exacerbate existing social and economic divides.\n\n13.3 With AI research and development currently concentrated in the hands of a few, very large companies that control the resources to erect high entry barriers, AI adoption in place of humans presents the risk of concentrating the benefits of automation. Korinek and Stiglitz (2021) warn that labour- and resource-saving automation could produce a 'winner-takes-all' approach to the detriment of developing countries who are labourand  resource-rich 3 .  Technological  developments  that  worsen  inequality  can  erode any possible benefit that the innovation brings, leaving the public sector responsible for addressing the cost of the transition. This has led to calls for a more responsible approach to AI adoption 4 , especially in a country like India where employment numbers make the magnitude of impact something worth paying attention to.\n\n13.4 Although until this point, the use of AI/Machine Learning (ML) 5  enabled tools and applications  were  already  widespread  and  part  of  productivity  suites  for  years, the end-user's facetime with the integrated 'AI' features was essentially minimal and unconscious. Examples include the autocomplete function on a smartphone keyboard, Google's  and  Apple's  smartphone  virtual  assistants,  personalised  recommendations on e-commerce platforms and media streaming services, and curated feeds on social media sites, among many others. Most users never paid much attention to the host of ML-powered features while enjoying the convenience they delivered. This changed in light of the developments witnessed in the last four years. The perceptions about AI has now drastically shifted, spurring debates about the need to align AI developments with broader societal goals.\n\n13.5  OpenAI  has  initiated  an  'arms  race'  in  AI  as  between  2022  and  2024,  many companies, including big tech firms, have scrambled to capitalise on the demand for AI.\n\n2  2024 Gartner CEO and Senior Business Executive Survey.

Working Paper 28453. National Bureau of Economic Research, https://tinyurl.com/2vvxkwdx\n\n4  A letter jointly written by Dr. Rajiv Kumar (former Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog), Sridhar Vembu (CEO, Zoho Corporation) &amp; Sharad Sharma (Co-founder of the iSPIRT Foundation) highlights their concerns.\n\n5  While Artificial Intelligence is used to describe the ability of a machine to mimic human intelligence, machine learning is a subset of AI that allows machines to learn from data and improve without being explicitly programmed.\n\nExamples include but are not limited to Google (Gemini), Microsoft (Co-Pilot), Meta (MetaAI with Llama), X/Twitter (Grok), Anthropic (Claude AI), Midjourney, Perplexity AI (Perplexity) and Stability AI (Stable Diffusion), among others. The number of AI patents granted globally increased 62.7 per cent to just over 62,000 between 2021 and 2022 6 . Similarly, the annual global private investments in Generative AI surged from approximately USD 3 billion in 2022 to USD 25.2 billion by the end of 2023 7 . Between 2021 and 2023, global corporate investments in all types of AI totalled USD 761 billion. Additionally, an increasing share of companies have been referencing AI in their earning calls lately 8 , with CEOs expecting AI adoption to lower labour requirements.\n\n13.6 If one were to look at these trends and the value generation expected from the investments, it would appear as if the 'AI revolution' is here and labour is soon going to be a thing of the past. Unease about what AI entails for workers and what it means for humanity as a whole has become part of daily discussions among academicians and policymakers, as reflected in many publications and reports. Making sense of these fears and anxieties would require a more in-depth breakdown of the short-term and long-term  implications.  Since  there  are  many  unknowns  associated  with  AI  at  this point, looking at the present through the lens of previous technological revolutions may provide some insights into the way forward. Advancing the understanding about the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead is the purpose of this essay.\n\n13.7  In this regard Section 2 brings to light the adverse effects that emerged during previous technological revolutions and how they pertain to present-day concerns about Artificial  Intelligence.  The  section  also  elaborates  on  the  importance  of  remaining cognisant, as disruptions that are not carefully managed can lead to permanent societal damage for a country like India. Section 3 then goes on to discuss how these risks can be minimised through the creation of Social Infrastructure i.e., Institutions. The priority here is minimisation since the risks can never be fully mitigated. That is the price of innovation induced creative destruction. The various types of institutions detailed in this section can provide a much needed support system to ease the pains of a transition.\n\n13.8 However, building institutions is a time consuming process, requiring concerted effort from the public sector, the private sector and members of academia. In Section 4, we put forward the hypothesis that India, at present, is afforded this time due to the challenging nature of scaling up technological adoption. Deployment at scale will require AI developers to address certain key challenges which requires a non-trivial\n\n6  Figure 1.2.1.

Section 5 then outlines possible opportunities that AI may open up for India. It seeks to visualise a possible labour market evolution where the future of work is augmented by AI. Whether or not we go down this path will depend entirely on how robust our institutions are. Section 6 concludes the essay.\n\n##",
