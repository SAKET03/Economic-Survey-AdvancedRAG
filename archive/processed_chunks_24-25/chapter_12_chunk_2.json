As  the  crucial  link  between  growth  and  prosperity,  the  quantity  and  quality  of employment in an economy determines how economic growth sustainably percolates the masses. With around 26 per cent of the population in the age group 10-24 years, India stands at the cusp of a once-in-a-lifetime demographic opportunity. 1  As one of the youngest nations globally, India's economic success depends on integrating its growing workforce  into  productive  and  meaningful  roles,  ensuring  inclusive  and  long-term growth.\n\n12.2.  In 2014, India was ranked as the tenth-largest economy in the world. In under a decade, India surpassed the UK to reach the fourth position. She is poised to be the\n\n1   State of the World Population Report 2024, United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) (https://www.unfpa.org/ swp2024)\n\nthird  largest  economy  by  2030,  after  the  USA  and  China.  By  2030,  she  will  have  a growing  working-age  population  and  healthy  manufacturing  sector.  The  country's demographic trend highlights the growing potential for a demographic dividend. 2  The currently young population, with a median age of around 28 years, compared to the ageing population of developed countries, is the key driver of the growth potential. 3\n\n12.3.  The  declining  dependency  ratio 4 ,  marked  by  the  falling  child  dependency  ratio following declining fertility rates, has contributed to this demographic advantage. This is  further supported by a relatively gradual increase in the elderly dependency ratio due to increased life expectancy. 5  The total dependency ratio has declined from 64.6 per cent in 2011 to 55.7 per cent in 2021 and is projected to fall further to 54.3 per cent by 2026. 6   The  expanding  working-age  population  offers  opportunities  for  economic growth, provided these individuals are employed in productive sectors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Report of the Technical Group on Population Projections for India and States 2011-2036, Ministry of Health &amp; Family Welfare (MoHFW), July, 2020\n\n12.4.    The Economic Survey 2023-24 highlighted that the Indian economy must generate, on average, 78.5 lakh non-farm jobs annually until 2030 to productively engage its growing  working  population.  Creating  quality  jobs  remains  an  ongoing  endeavour and a well-recognised national priority, pivotal to ensuring inclusive and sustainable economic growth. Further, the ambitions and aspirations of the workforce align with the need to generate employment opportunities to leverage the country's demographic dividend and to accelerate the structural transformation from farm to non-farm jobs.\n\n7   Infant mortality rate (or IMR) is the number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births during the year.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n12.5.
