  "content": "Chapter 1 Summary:\nThe global economy exhibited steady yet uneven growth across regions in 2024. The slowdown in global manufacturing, especially in Europe and parts of Asia, was due to supply chain disruptions and weak external demand. In contrast, the services sector performed better, supporting growth in many economies. Inflationary pressures eased in most economies, but services inflation remained persistent. Commodity prices stabilized, but the risk of synchronised price increases persists. Central banks may chart varying paths of monetary easing, leading to uncertainty over future policy rates and inflation trajectories. Geopolitical tensions, ongoing conflicts, and trade policy risks continue to pose significant challenges to global economic stability. India's economy displayed steady growth, with real GDP estimated to grow by 6.4% in FY25. Growth in the first half of FY25 was supported by agriculture and services, with rural demand improving due to record Kharif production and favorable agricultural conditions. The manufacturing sector faced pressures due to weak global demand and domestic seasonal conditions. Private consumption remained stable, reflecting steady domestic demand. Fiscal discipline and strong external balance supported by a services trade surplus and healthy remittance growth contributed to macroeconomic stability. India's economic prospects for FY26 are balanced, with headwinds including elevated geopolitical and trade uncertainties and possible commodity price shocks. Domestically, the translation of order books of the private capital goods sector into sustained investment pick-up, improvements in consumer confidence, and corporate wage pick-up will be key to promoting growth. Rural demand backed by a rebound in agricultural production, anticipated easing of food inflation, and a stable macro-economic environment provide an upside to near-term growth. India will need to improve its global competitiveness through grassroots-level structural reforms and deregulation to reinforce its medium-term growth potential. The global economy grew by 3.3% in 2023, with the IMF projecting growth of 3.2% and 3.3% for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Global growth is expected to average around 3.2% over the next five years. Advanced economies witnessed stable growth in the first half of 2024, but growth varies across regions. The US is expected to grow at 2.8% in 2024, while the Euro Area is expected to grow at 0.8% in 2024 and 1.0% in 2025. India's real GDP growth for FY25 is estimated to be 6.4%, with private final consumption expenditure growing by 7.3%. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) is estimated to grow by 6.4%. The services sector is expected to grow at 7.2% in FY25. The agriculture sector is expected to rebound to a growth of 3.8% in FY25. The industrial sector is estimated to grow by 6.2% in FY25. Construction activities and electricity, gas, water supply, and other utility services are expected to support industrial expansion. The services sector continues to perform well, driven by healthy activity in financial, real estate, professional services, public administration, defense, and other services. The analysis of growth trends is based on the trends in the first half (H1) of FY25. Aggregate GVA surpassed its pre-pandemic trend in Q1 FY25 and now hovers above the trend in H1 FY25. The agriculture sector remains strong, consistently operating well above trend levels. The industrial sector has also found its footing above the pre-pandemic trajectory. The robust rate of growth in recent years has taken the services sector close to its trend levels. Construction has been a standout, gaining momentum since mid-FY21 and soaring approximately 15% above its pre-pandemic trend. Manufacturing, while steadily recovering, remains slightly below its pre-pandemic trajectory. Mining continues to operate below its pre-pandemic trend. The recovery within the services sector has been uneven. Financial, real estate, and professional services have taken the lead, surpassing pre-pandemic trend levels. Public administration, defense, and other services followed suit, exceeding the trend for the first time in Q1 of FY25. Trade, hotels, transport, and communication services are gradually catching up with the pre-pandemic trend. The real GVA grew by 6.2% in H1 FY25, driven by a strong growth momentum in Q1 FY25 and a subdued performance in Q2 FY25. The agriculture and services sectors emerged as key growth drivers during this period. However, the overall growth was tempered by moderation in industrial growth, particularly in manufacturing, which faced challenges from slowing global demand and supply chain disruptions. Agriculture growth remained steady in H1 FY25, with Q2 recording a growth rate of 3.5%. Healthy Kharif production, above-normal monsoons, and an adequate reservoir level supported agricultural growth. The estimated increase in Kharif food grain production is mainly on account of the rise in rice, maize, coarse grains, and oilseeds output. A normal southwest monsoon in 2024 has improved the water levels in reservoirs, ensuring sufficient water for irrigation during the rabi crop production. As of 10 January 2025, rabi sowing of wheat and gram was 1.4% and 0.8% higher, respectively, compared to the previous year. Improved agricultural prospects also bode well for softening of food inflation pressures over the course of the year. The industrial sector grew by 6% in H1 FY25, with Q1 seeing a strong growth of 8.3%, but growth moderated in Q2. The moderation in growth can be attributed to three key factors: slowing global demand, the impact of above-average monsoon on certain sectors, and variation in the timing of festivities. Disaggregated data reveals that while many manufacturing sub-sectors experienced growth, others faced challenges, likely due to global and seasonal factors. The services sector continues to perform well in FY25, with a notable growth in Q1 and Q2 resulting in 7.1% growth in H1 FY25. Across sub-categories, all the sub-sectors have performed well. The robust performance of the services sector is also reflected in high-frequency indicators (HFIs). PMI services have been in an expansionary zone during H1 FY25, supported by growth in new orders, rise in output, improvement in sales, and enhanced employment generation. India's GDP at constant (2011-12) prices grew by 6.7% and 5.4% in Q1 and Q2 FY25, respectively. This implied a real GDP growth of 6.0% in the first half of the current fiscal. From a demand perspective, Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) firmed up in H1 FY25, growing by 6.7% YoY. Indicators such as 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler sales and tractor sales signal that rural demand contributed to private consumption growth. Rural demand is expected to continue in the second half of the fiscal year with the returns from a bumper Kharif crop and higher MSPs for a prospectively good Rabi crop. Urban demand presented mixed trends, with passenger vehicle sales slowing to 4.2% YoY in April-November 2024. Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sales in urban areas recorded a moderate growth in H1FY25. However, there is steady growth of 7.7% YoY in air passenger traffic in April-November 2024. The moderation in real GDP growth can be traced to a softening of growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) from 10.1% in H1 FY24 to 6.4% in H1 FY25. The slowdown in investment activity is likely temporary, with green shoots in capital formation visible. Union government capex is up 8.2% in July-November 2024 and is expected to pick up further pace. Early results of the RBI's Order Books, Inventory, and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) show that the seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation (CU) in manufacturing firms was 74.7% in Q2 FY25, above the long-term average of 73.8%. A private sector report's analysis of a sample of capital goods companies indicates that the order books of these companies have registered a sharp increase of 23.6% in FY24. In H1 FY25, there has been a growth of 10.3% compared to the end of FY24. The RBI's report on private investments showed that investment intentions increased to ₹2.45 lakh crore for FY25 as compared to ₹1.6 lakh crore for FY24. On the external front, exports of goods and non-factor services at constant prices increased by 5.6% in H1 FY25, while imports increased by 0.7%. India's external sector displayed mixed trends, primarily due to volatile global conditions. Merchandise exports grew by 1.6% YoY in April-December 2024, while non-petroleum exports were up by 7.1%. Services trade surplus has lent balance to the overall trade deficit. India's robust services exports have propelled the country to secure the seventh-largest share in global services exports. Remittances from abroad led to a healthy net inflow of private transfers, with India being the top recipient of remittances in the world. The current account deficit (CAD) remains relatively contained at 1.2% of GDP in Q2 FY25. Comfortable financing of the CAD by the capital account has ensured external sector stability. Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows increased 17.9% YoY in April-November 2024. Net FDI inflow declined over this period, primarily on account of the uptick in repatriation. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows have been volatile in the second half of 2024. Net FPI inflows slowed to USD 10.6 billion in April-December 2024 from USD 31.7 billion during the same period the previous year. India's foreign exchange reserves increased from USD 616.7 billion at the end of January 2024 to USD 704.9 billion in September 2024 before moderating to USD 634.6 billion as on 3 January 2025. The banking and financial sector remains stable and well-capitalised, catering to the financing needs of the economy. Credit disbursal by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) is growing in double-digits, but there has been a moderation in the growth in recent months. The gross non-performing assets (NPAs) in the banking system have declined to a 12-year low of 2.6% of gross loans and advances. The capital-to-risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) for SCBs stands at 16.7% as of September 2024, well above the norm. The profitability of SCBs improved during H1 FY25, with profit after tax (PAT) surging by 22.2% YoY. India's labour market growth in recent years has been supported by post-pandemic recovery and increased formalisation. The unemployment rate for individuals aged 15 years and above has steadily declined from 6% in 2017-18 to 3.2% in 2023-24. The labour force participation rate (LFPR) and the worker-to-population ratio (WPR) have also increased. Net Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) subscriptions more than doubled from 61 lakh in FY19 to 131 lakh in FY24. In April-November 2024, net additions reached 95.6 lakh, driven largely by youth. The near-term global growth is expected to be a shade lower than the trend level. Inflationary pressures have been easing globally, though risks of synchronised price pressures linger due to potential geopolitical disruptions. Central banks have adopted more accommodative monetary policies. Rebounding rural demand augurs well for consumption. Investment activity is expected to pick up, supported by higher public capex and improving business expectations. Food inflation is likely to soften in Q4 FY25 with the seasonal easing of vegetable prices and Kharif harvest arrivals. Good Rabi production is likely to contain food prices in the first half of FY26. The growth in FY26 would be between 6.3 and 6.8%.\n\nSubchapter 4 Content:\n# Domestic Economy Remains Steady Amidst Global Uncertainties\n\nDOMESTIC ECONOMY REMAINS STEADY AMIDST GLOBAL UNCERTAINTIES\n\n1.22 As per the first advance estimates released by the National Statistical Office, Ministry  of  Statistics  &amp;  Programme  Implementation  (MoSPI),  the  real  gross domestic product (GDP) growth for FY25 is estimated to be 6.4 per cent. From the angle of aggregate demand in the economy, private final consumption expenditure at constant prices is estimated to grow by 7.3 per cent, driven by a rebound in rural demand. PFCE as a share of GDP (at current prices) is estimated to increase from 60.3 per cent in FY24 to 61.8 per cent in FY25. This share is the highest since FY03. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) (at constant prices) is estimated to grow by 6.4 per cent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Calculations based on Statement 13: Annual and Quarterly Estimates of GDP at constant prices, MoSPI Note: FY25 values are First Advance Estimates.\n\n1.23 On the supply side, real gross value added (GVA) is also estimated to grow by 6.4 per cent. The agriculture sector is expected to rebound to a growth of 3.8 per cent in  FY25. The industrial sector is estimated to grow by 6.2 per cent in FY25. Strong growth rates in construction activities and electricity, gas, water supply and other utility\n\nservices are expected to support industrial expansion. Growth in the services sector is expected to remain robust at 7.2 per cent, driven by healthy activity in financial, real estate, professional services, public administration, defence, and other services. The analysis of growth trends in this chapter, hereinafter, is mostly based on the trends in the first half (H1) of FY25, on which the information base is more comprehensive.\n\n## Resilient recovery\n\n1.24 The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions to economies worldwide. Economic Survey 2023-24 14  compared the post-pandemic trends until Q4 FY24 with the  pre-pandemic  trajectory  and  concluded  that  the  economy  grew  briskly  enough to avert any permanent loss of output. This section extends the analysis to Q2 FY25 (ending September 2024) with a sectoral view of the economy.\n\n1.25  The  overall  picture  is  encouraging.  Aggregate  GVA  surpassed  its  pre-pandemic trend in Q1 FY25, and it now hovers above the trend in the H1 FY25  15 . The agriculture sector remains strong, consistently operating well above trend levels. The industrial sector has also found its footing above the pre-pandemic trajectory. The robust rate of  growth  in  the  recent  years  has  taken  the  services  sector  close  to  its  trend  levels (Chart I.21 to Chart I.24).\n\n1.26 A closer look at industrial sub-sectors reveals a spectrum of performances (Chart I.25). Construction has been a standout, gaining momentum since mid-FY21 and soaring approximately 15 per cent above its pre-pandemic trend-an impressive feat driven by robust infrastructure development and housing demand. The utilities sector, including electricity,  gas,  water  supply, and other services, reached its pre-pandemic trend by the end of FY23 and has consistently stayed above these levels. Manufacturing, while steadily  recovering,  remains  slightly  below  its  pre-pandemic  trajectory.  Meanwhile, mining continues to operate below its pre-pandemic trend.\n\n1.27  The recovery within the services sector has been uneven (Chart I.26). Financial, real  estate  and  professional  services  have  taken  the  lead,  surpassing  pre-pandemic trend  levels  by  the  end  of  FY23.  Public  administration,  defence,  and  other  services followed suit, exceeding the trend for the first time in Q1 of FY25 since the onset of the  pandemic.  However,  trade,  hotels,  transport,  and  communication  services  are gradually catching up with the pre-pandemic trend. These contact-intensive sectors faced challenges due to lockdown, restricted demand for travel, and reduced demand for hospitality, entertainment, and personal services.\n\n14  Economic survey 2023-24, Chapter 1 - State of the Economy, Box I.1: Growth in GDP, GVA, and their components ensure no permanent losses in demand and output. https://tinyurl.com/r8ykzwj6.\n\n15  H1 refers to the first half of the corresponding Financial Year that is April to September.\n\nChart I.21: Aggregate GVA recovery continues\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChart I.23: Industrial GVA operating above the trend level\n\nChart I.22: Agriculture GVA sustained at higher levels\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChart I.24: Services GVA is close to its trend\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChart I.25: Construction GVA operating well above trend levels, and manufacturing GVA gradually recovering\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Calculations based on Statement 13: Annual and Quarterly Estimates of GDP at constant prices, MoSPI Note:  i) FREPS -  Financial,  real  estate  and  professional  services  ii) TTHCSB -  Trade,  transport,  hotel, communication and services related to broadcasting iii) PADOS - Public administration, defence &amp; other services. All de-seasonalised variables are derived from National Accounts variables at constant (2011-12) prices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Growth in H1 FY25 driven by agriculture and services sector\n\n1.28 The real GVA grew by 6.2 per cent in H1 FY25. A strong growth momentum in Q1 FY25 was followed by a subdued performance in Q2 FY25. The agriculture and services sectors emerged as key growth drivers during this period. However, the overall growth was tempered by moderation in industrial growth, particularly in manufacturing, which faced challenges from slowing global demand and supply chain disruptions.\n\n## Improved agricultural prospects in FY25\n\n1.29 Agriculture growth remained steady in H1 FY25, with Q2 recording a growth rate of  3.5  per  cent,  marking  an  improvement  over  the  previous  four  quarters.  Healthy Kharif production, above-normal monsoons, and an adequate reservoir level supported agricultural growth. As per the first advanced estimates of agricultural production for 2024-25, total Kharif food grain production is estimated at a record 1647.05 lakh metric tonnes (LMT), higher by 5.7 per cent compared to 2023-24 and 8.2 per cent higher than the average food grain production in the past five years. The estimated increase is mainly on account of the rise in rice, maize, coarse grains and oilseeds output. A normal southwest  monsoon  in  2024  has  improved  the  water  levels  in  reservoirs,  ensuring sufficient water for irrigation during the rabi crop production. As of 10 January 2025,\n\nrabi sowing of wheat and gram was 1.4 per cent and 0.8 per cent higher, respectively, compared  to  the  previous  year.  Improved  agricultural  prospects  also  bode  well  for softening of food inflation pressures over the course of the year.\n\n## Manufacturing sector growth moderates but shows positive expectations\n\n1.30 The industrial sector grew by 6 per cent in H1 FY25. Q1 saw a strong growth of 8.3 per cent, but growth moderated in Q2 due to three key factors. First, manufacturing exports slowed significantly due to weak demand from destination countries, and aggressive trade and industrial policies in major trading nations. Second, the aboveaverage monsoon had mixed effects - while it replenished reservoirs and supported agriculture, it also disrupted sectors like mining, construction, and, to some extent, manufacturing. Third, the variation in the timing of festivities between September and October in the previous and current years led to a modest growth slowdown in Q2 FY25.\n\n1.31  Disaggregated data reveals that while many manufacturing sub-sectors experienced growth, others faced challenges, likely due to global and seasonal factors. Oil companies suffered due to inventory losses and lower refining margins, while steel companies faced price pressures and lower global prices. The cement sector faced weak demand in Q2 due to heavy rains and lower selling prices. However, with the conclusion of the monsoon season and the expected pick-up in government capital expenditure, sectors such as cement, iron, and steel are expected to see a recovery. Further, mining and electricity are expected to normalise after the monsoon-related disruptions. 16\n\n1.32 Despite  various  challenges,  India  continues  to  register  the  fastest  growth  in manufacturing PMI, which is also reflected in Chart I.7 of the previous section. The latest Manufacturing PMI for December 2024 remained well within the expansionary zone. The expansion rate for December 2024 exceeded its long-term average, driven by new business gains, robust demand, and advertising efforts. Meanwhile, international orders grew to a four-month high midway through the third fiscal quarter, signalling recovering external demand, as reported by companies.\n\n16  RBI Governor's Statement: December 6, 2024 https://tinyurl.com/4j6xwp2r.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.33 According to the RBI's Industrial Outlook Survey, manufacturing firms reported improved demand conditions in Q3 FY25 and expect further improvements in Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26. The survey also reflected better expectations for production, order books, employment,  capacity  utilisation,  and  the  overall  business  environment  during  Q4 FY25 and Q1 FY26.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: RBI's Quarterly Industrial Outlook Survey\n\nNote: * indicates expectations for the upcoming quarter; The survey results are summarised through a measure called Net Response, constructed as the difference between the proportions of respondents giving 'optimistic' and 'pessimistic' replies.\n\n## Robust growth in the services sector\n\n1.34 The services sector continues to perform well in FY25. A notable growth in Q1 and Q2 resulted in 7.1 per cent growth in H1 FY25. Across sub-categories, all the sub-sectors have performed well. The robust performance of the services sector is also reflected\n\nin high-frequency indicators (HFIs). PMI services have been in an expansionary zone during H1 FY25, supported by growth in new orders, rise in output, improvement in sales and enhanced employment generation. The hospitality sector performed well, with hotel occupancy rates in H1 FY25 similar to the previous year. Average daily rates and revenue per room increased due to higher corporate and leisure travel. Air cargo activity grew in double digits, while port traffic remained stable. Information Technology (IT) companies also performed better than the previous quarter. 17\n\n## Analysis of GDP by expenditure categories\n\n1.35  India's GDP at constant (2011-12) prices grew by 6.7 per cent and 5.4 per cent in Q1 and Q2 FY25, respectively. This implied a real GDP growth of 6.0 per cent in the first half of the current fiscal.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Calculations based on Statement 13: Annual and Quarterly Estimates of GDP at constant prices and Statement 14: Annual and Quarterly Estimates of GDP at current prices, MoSPI\n\n1.36 From  a  demand  perspective,  Private  Final  Consumption  Expenditure  (PFCE) firmed up in H1 FY25, growing by 6.7 per cent YoY. While National Accounts data is not disaggregated by geography, indicators such as 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler sales and tractor sales signal that rural demand contributed to private consumption growth. This is also reflected in the January 2025 round of National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD's) Rural Economic Conditions and Sentiments Survey, where 78.5 per cent of rural households reported an increase in their consumption expenditure during the last year. 18  The impulse from rural demand is expected to continue in the second half of the fiscal year with the returns from a bumper Kharif crop and higher MSPs for a prospectively good Rabi crop.\n\n17  Reserve Bank of India. (2024, December 24). RBI Bulletin December 2024. https://tinyurl.com/rur6xe8u.\n\n18  NABARD, Rural economic conditions &amp; sentiments survey. (January 2025) https://tinyurl.com/3cu6pfk9.\n\n1.37 On  the  other  hand,  indicators  of  urban  demand  presented  mixed  trends. According  to  data  from  the  Federation  of  Automobile  Dealers  Associations (FADA) 19 , the growth of passenger vehicle sales has slowed to 4.2 per YoY cent in April - November 2024 compared to 9.2 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year. Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sales in urban areas, as per  Nielsen  IQ,  have  recorded  a  moderate  growth  in  H1FY25.  However,  there  is steady growth of 7.7 per cent YoY in air passenger traffic in April - November 2024. The 7.3 per cent YoY growth indicated by the First Advance Estimates for PFCE at constant prices for FY25 indicates a pick-up in the most recent months.\n\n1.38 The  moderation in  real  GDP  growth  can  be  traced  to  a  softening  of  growth  in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) from 10.1 per cent in H1 FY24 to 6.4 per cent in  H1  FY25.  Q1  FY25  witnessed  a  slowdown  in  capital  expenditure  across  different levels of government on account of the conduct of the general elections. Private sector investment growth may have remained subdued thus far in FY25 on account of the domestic political timetable, global uncertainties and overcapacities.\n\nSource: Calculations based on Statement 14: Annual and Quarterly Estimates of GDP at current prices, MoSPI\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.39 An additional reason for the slowdown in capital formation growth in Q2 FY25 may have emanated from the moderation in residential investment by households in this quarter, which is on the back of a sharp uptick over the last few quarters. Industry reports, however, point out that the correction in demand-supply metrics in this sector is indicative of market normalisation after a period of robust performance. An inventory overhang of 23 months signals healthy demand momentum in the segment.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.40 The  slowdown  in  investment  activity  is  likely  temporary.  Green  shoots  in  capital formation are visible. Union government capex is up 8.2 per cent in July - November 2024 and is expected to pick up further pace. Early results of the RBI's Order Books, Inventory, and  Capacity  Utilisation  Survey  (OBICUS)  show  that  the  seasonally  adjusted  capacity utilisation (CU) in manufacturing firms was 74.7 per cent in Q2 FY25, above the longterm average of 73.8 per cent. 21 A private sector report's 22 analysis of a sample of capital goods companies indicates that the order books of these companies have registered a sharp increase of 23.6 per cent in FY24 as against a compund anual growth rate (CAGR) of 4.5 per cent in the preceding four years. Moreover, in H1 FY25, there has been a growth of 10.3 per cent compared to the end of FY24. The RBI's report on private investments showed that investment intentions increased to ₹2.45 lakh crore for FY25 as compared to ₹1.6 lakh crore for FY24. Along with fresh investment, some of the existing intentions would spill over and be implemented in FY26.\n\n1.41  On the external front, exports of goods and non-factor services at constant prices increased by 5.6 per cent in H1 FY25, while imports increased by 0.7 per cent. In Q2 FY25,  imports  of  goods  and  services  at  constant  prices  contracted  by  2.9  per  cent, primarily driven by a decline in commodity prices. As a result, net exports contributed positively to real GDP growth in this period.\n\n1.42 As  India's  economy  continues  to  expand,  the  growth  process  has  been  ably supported by stability on fronts such as inflation, fiscal health, and balance of payments.\n\n20 The top 8 cities refer to Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi-NCR, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Pune. 21 Footnote no. 19, RBI Governor's Statement: December 6, 2024 https://tinyurl.com/4j6xwp2r. 22 CARE Ratings. (2024, November). India's capex story gives a mixed picture. https://tinyurl.com/54ed858f.\n\nThe  following  section  presents  a  closer  examination  of  these  stability  factors  and provides valuable insights into the resilience and sustainability of the Indian economy in the face of global and domestic challenges.\n\n##",
