  "content": "Chapter 9 Summary:\nThe agricultural sector in India has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23. The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, reassuring them of a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the use of drones and fertigation techniques to optimize fertilizer applications. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has been introduced to enable farmers to meet their short-term working capital requirements promptly and hassle-free. The government has also launched the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) to provide insurance for farmers against crop losses due to natural calamities, pests, and diseases. The agricultural extension services have been strengthened to disseminate knowledge, enhance productivity, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. The government has also promoted private investment in agricultural marketing infrastructure through initiatives such as the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme. The food processing industry in India is one of the largest employers within organized manufacturing, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated several key programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The government has also implemented various initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). India's agricultural sector remains a crucial pillar for economic growth and ensuring food security for the nation, with significant potential for growth and development.\n\nSubchapter 10 Content:\n# Climate Action In Agriculture\n\nCLIMATE ACTION IN AGRICULTURE\n\n9.37 The NMSA is recognised as one of the nine missions within the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). The NMSA has identified key climate adaptation strategies, including enhancing water efficiency, managing soil health and nutrients, providing crop insurance, offering credit support, strengthening value chains, delivering  agro-advisories,  promoting  farm  mechanisation,  managing  agricultural waste,  developing  integrated  farming  systems,  and  supporting  organic  and  natural farming  practices.  It  also  emphasises  climate-resilient  varieties,  livestock,  and  fish culture, promoting these initiatives through various government schemes.\n\n9.38 To support organic farming, the government has implemented two dedicated schemes since 2015: the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and the Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCDNER). Under PKVY,  52,289  clusters  covering  14.99  lakh  hectares  and  25.30  lakh  farmers  have been  mobilised.  Similarly,  under  MOVCDNER,  434  Farmer  Producer  Companies have been created, covering a total area of 1.73 lakh hectares and benefiting 2.19 lakh farmers.\n\n## BOX IX.7 : Spatial mapping of agricultural sustainability\n\nA Composite Index of Agricultural Sustainability was calculated by ICAR using 51 indicators related to environmental health, soil and water quality, and socioeconomic development. The  average  estimated  value  of  the  Index  is  0.49,  suggesting  that  Indian  agriculture  is moderately sustainable. States like  Mizoram, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Manipur, West Bengal, and Uttarakhand perform better than the national average.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource: A Spatial Assessment of Sustainability in Indian Agriculture, Policy paper 42, 2024, ICAR\n\nIn  contrast,  arid  Rajasthan  has  the  least  sustainable  agricultural  practices.  According to  the  report,  the  states  with  higher  sustainability  scores  have  experienced  sizable  crop diversification,  improvement  in  agriculture  infrastructure,  farm  credit  and  sustainable input usage. States in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, including Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar, and Haryana, as well as rice-dominant states like Jharkhand and Assam, are at a higher risk of climate change impacts.\n\n##",
