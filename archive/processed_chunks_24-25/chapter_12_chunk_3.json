The  second  section  focuses  on  job  creation  and  outlines  the government's actions to enhance employment opportunities. It highlights initiatives such  as  labour  law  reforms,  potential  sectors  for  job  creation,  and  the  role  of  skill development.  The challenge of re-strategising the skills development framework to prepare the youth for evolving industry requirements domestically and internationally is discussed in the third section.\n\n## STATE OF EMPLOYMENT\n\n12.6.    India  has  experienced  good employment growth in recent years, following the nation's sustained economic momentum. The 2023-24 annual Periodic Labour Force Survey  (PLFS)  report  by  the  National  Statistical  Organisation  (NSO)  highlights  a significant post-pandemic recovery in employment trends across India. 8  The all-India annual unemployment rate (UR) for individuals aged 15 years and above (usual status) 9 has  steadily  declined  from  6  per  cent  in  2017-18  to  3.2  per  cent  in  2023-24. 10 This recovery has been accompanied by an increase in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) and the worker-to-population ratio (WPR). 11  Moreover, even under the stricter current weekly status (CWS) criteria, employment levels have rebounded strongly in both  urban  and  rural  areas,  reflecting  a  broad-based  recovery  since  the  COVID-19 pandemic. 12\n\n12.7.  In addition, the quarterly urban unemployment rate (UR) for people aged 15 years and above has shown improvement. The urban UR has dropped from 6.6 per cent in Q2 FY 24 to 6.4 per cent in Q2 FY 25. This positive shift aligns with a broader strengthening of workforce metrics in urban areas, as the LFPR increased from 49.3 per cent to 50.4 per cent, and the WPR rose from 46 per cent to 47.2 per cent during the same period (Q2 of FY24 to Q2 FY25). 13\n\n8  https://tinyurl.com/yaykmtat ; The period of the PLFS surveys is July-June. For example the survey period for 2023-24 is July 2023 to June 2024.\n\n9    For a person to be categorised as employed as per usual status (ps+ss), he/she must have pursued an economic activity for at least 30 days during the 365 days preceding the date of the survey.\n\n10    UR is defined as the percentage of unemployed persons in the labour force.\n\n11    According to the PLFS, LFPR is the percentage of working-age population engaged in work or making tangible. efforts to seek 'work' or being available for 'work' if it is available. 'Work' includes self-employment (subsistence agriculture  and  collection  of  firewood,  poultry  farming,  etc.,  for  self-consumption),  regular  wage/salaried employment, and casual labour. WPR is defined as the percentage of employed persons in the total population.\n\n12    In the case of CWS, the activity status is determined on the basis of a reference period of the last 7 days preceding the date of the survey.\n\n13  https://tinyurl.com/2myhmmed, Quarterly PLFS, MoSPI\n\n## Chart XII. 4.

The  2023-24  annual  PLFS  report  highlights  encouraging  trends  in  labour market conditions across India. Among the 36 states and union territories, only 12 have a WPR (for all ages) below the national average of 43.7 per cent, and 12 fall short of the national LFPR (for all ages) average of 45.1 per cent (refer to Chart XII.6). Further, 14 states have achieved over a 10-percentage point increase in WPR 14 , and 11 states have recorded a similar increase in LFPR compared to 2017-18. 15,16\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.9.     The proportion of self-employed workers in the workforce has risen from 52.2 per cent in 2017-18 to 58.4 per cent in 2023-24. This shift reflects growing entrepreneurial activity and a preference for flexible work arrangements. While the share of workers (male and female) in regular/salaried jobs decreased from 22.8 per cent to 21.7 per cent during the same period, the trend has stabilised since 2020-21, with employment levels either holding steady or showing gradual improvement. The decline in casual workers, from 24.9 per cent to 19.8 per cent, also indicates a shift toward more structured forms of  self-employment.  These  changes  suggest  an  evolving  workforce  that  embraces flexibility  and independence in response to industry transformations and individual preferences.\n\n12.10.  According to PLFS data, the shift in employment trends has been particularly impactful  for  women.  While  the  proportion  of  women  in  regular  wage/salaried employment  decreased,  more  women  engage  in  self-employment  or  contribute  to household enterprises, especially in rural areas. For instance, in rural India, women's participation in regular wage jobs fell from 10.5 per cent in 2017-18 to 7.8 per cent in 2023-24, coinciding with an increase in women working as \"own account workers/ employers\" or \"helpers in household enterprises.\" In urban areas, salaried employment for women decreased from 52.1 per cent to 49.4 per cent. The bulk of the drop occurred in 2020-21, when it dropped to 50.1 per cent from 54.2 per cent the year before. This was accompanied by a rise in entrepreneurial ventures and flexible work roles.\n\n12.11.  Among  rural  women,  the  share  of  \"own  account  workers/employers\"  surged from 19 per cent in 2017-18 to 31.2 per cent in 2023-24, highlighting a significant move toward independent work and entrepreneurship. Similarly, the share of \"helpers in household enterprises\", which represents unpaid family labour, grew from 38.7 per cent to 42.3 per cent, indicating a rise in family-oriented economic activities.   The rise in casual wages could be one of the factors contributing to this increasing reliance on family labour within household enterprises. Urban areas also witnessed a positive shift, with \"own account workers/employers\" increasing from 23.7 per cent to 28.5 per cent and \"helpers in household enterprises\" from 11 per cent to 13.8 per cent over the same period.\n\n12.12   PLFS covers the period from July to June; hence, the full force of the lockdowns in  different  states  is  felt  in  2019-20.  The  impact  of  the  pandemic  felt  in  lost  years of  schooling, and the health of the elderly resulted in women leaving regular wage/ salary work and taking up flexible work so that they could take care of children who stayed at home due to school closures and elders who needed extra care and attention. Subsequently, the enhanced flexibility that 'own account work' allows and the expanded\n\nopportunities it has brought for women have seen this category grow in the share of overall employment.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n12.13.  Initiatives  such  as  Mudra  Yojana,  Skill  India,  Start-Up  India,  and  Stand-Up India have played a pivotal role in fostering entrepreneurship, providing skill training, and  supporting  individuals  in  creating  self-reliant  and  sustainable  livelihoods.  This ecosystem  of  support  reflects  the  growing  emphasis  on  empowering  individuals  to chart their own professional paths.\n\n## Sectoral distribution of the workforce\n\n12.14.  According  to  the  PLFS  2023-24,  the  agriculture  sector  remains  dominant  in employment, with its share rising from 44.1 per cent in 2017-18 to 46.1 per cent in 2023-24. The share of industry and services sectors saw declines in employment share, with manufacturing falling from 12.1 per cent to 11.4 per cent, and services from 31.1 per cent to 29.7 per cent during the same period. The share of female workers in agriculture has increased significantly, from 57.0 per cent in 2017-18 to 64.4 per cent in 2023-24, whereas, male participation in agriculture decreased from 40.2 per cent to 36.3 per cent. Greater male involvement in sectors like construction, trade, hotel, restaurant, transport, storage and communication services is observed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Annual PLFS report 2023-24, MoSPI\n\nNote: The 'other services' category includes activities belonging to publishing, consultancy services, information services, financial and insurance services, real estate, legal and accounting, advertising, health and education services, tours and travels, arts, entertainment and recreation, etc.\n\n12.15.  In rural areas, female agricultural employment rose from 73.2 per cent in 201718 to 76.9 in 2023-24 per cent, while male participation decreased from 55.0 per cent to 49.4 per cent, reflecting a shift towards non-agricultural sectors during the same period. In urban areas, women predominantly work in other services, though this share declined slightly from 44.4 per cent in 2017-18 to 40.1 per cent in 2023-24.  Significant employment  of  females  is  also  observed  in  manufacturing,  trade,  and  agriculture. Male  workers  in  urban  areas  are  seen  to  be  primarily  employed  in  manufacturing, construction, and trade-related services.\n\n## Rise in Female LFPR: Tapping into female labour for economic growth\n\n12.16.  From the gender perspective, the female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) has been rising for seven years, i.e., from 23.3 per cent in 2017-18 to 41.7 per cent in 2023-24, driven mainly by the rising participation of rural women. The notable rise in the FLFPR is the primary driver of the overall improvement in the labour market indicators.\n\n12.17.  The FLFPR has improved across states. In 2017-18, 20 states/UTs had FLFPR of less than 20 per cent. This number has gone down to three in 2023-24 Currently, most states (21) have a FLFPR in the range of 30-40 per cent.  Seven states/ UTs reported FLFPR greater than 40 per cent in 2023-24, with Sikkim reporting the maximum rate of 56.9 per cent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n12.18.  The increase in the rural FLFPR largely drives the increase in FLFPR, which rose from 24.6 per cent in 2017-18 to 47.6 per cent in 2023-24. This rise could be attributed to  women  taking  advantage  of  new  opportunities  brought  about  by  the  various government initiatives to promote female participation in the labour force. Box XII.1 discusses the possible reasons for higher FLFPR in India. It also elaborates on findings from a primary survey conducted in selected districts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh in November 2024 regarding the increase in FLFPR.\n\n## Box XII.1: Factors influencing the female labour force participation\n\nPLFS 2023-24 shows enhanced participation of women in economic activities across various categories, including rural and urban. This increase in FLFPR can partly be attributed to better capturing female workers in unpaid work by the PLFS survey. 17   Further, the increase\n\n17  PIB release of Ministry of Labour &amp; Employment dated 18 November 2024. (https://tinyurl.com/3usymatj).\n\nin  the  rural  FLFPR  can  be  attributed  to  the  skilling  initiatives  and  improved  access  to credit  for  diversified  livelihoods  provided  to  women's  collectives  under  the  Deendayal Antyodaya Yojana - National Rural Livelihood Mission (DAY-NRLM). The increased push of government towards encouraging entrepreneurship is also likely a key contributor to the increased participation of women in the labour force. Some of these initiatives are discussed in Box XII.2.\n\nTo better understand the labour market choices of female workers, both paid and unpaid, a  survey  was  conducted  among  married  women  aged  25  to  45  in  rural  areas  who  were relatively less financially privileged. The survey focused on those receiving loans from SHGs and represented a population poorer than the average Indian population.  18  It was observed that 34 per cent of surveyed women were engaged in paid work, most pronounced among poorer households. In the households below average levels of wealth in the sample, 46 per cent of women are engaged in paid work, whereas less than 15 per cent of women are engaged in paid work if they come from the top 10 per cent of wealthiest households in the sample.\n\nAmong women not engaged in paid work, 58 per cent were engaged in unpaid work (helping the household in agricultural tasks). This suggests that more than 70 per cent of the married women were engaged in  (paid  or  unpaid)  labour,  directly  generating  greater  household income. Further, about 55 per cent of those currently out of the workforce cited household and childcare duties as barriers to entering the paid workforce.\n\nAccording to some research,  gender  norms  and  the  associated  responsibilities/responsibilities of childcare and household responsibilities are prominent reasons for women not taking up paid work despite the desire to do so. 19 This finding highlights the care sector's vast potential for increasing FLFPR, as noted in the Economic Survey 2023-24.\n\nThe Economic Survey 2023-24 (Box VIII.2) highlighted the systemic barriers that impede job  opportunities  for  women.  To  sustain  and  enhance  women's  participation  in  the workforce, it is essential to remove restrictions on women working in certain occupations. This responsibility lies with state governments. As women cite childcare responsibilities as a consideration in deciding on employment, childcare facilities and crèches will go a long way in female participation in the labour force. Additionally, policies should prioritise targeted skill development and support for emerging sectors while encouraging transitioning from traditional to non-traditional roles. Aligning skill development programmes with industry needs and adopting a long-term strategy focused on women and girls will prepare them for evolving job opportunities and help India effectively leverage its demographic dividend. Reshaping the labour market with an emphasis on women-led development is crucial for achieving gender parity and fostering inclusive economic growth.\n\n18    This was part of the same survey done by Artha Global's Centre for Rapid Insights (CRI) as reported in Box XI.2 in chapter 11. Artha Global's Centre for Rapid Insights (CRI) conducted a survey of approximately 2400 married women between the ages of 25 and 45 in rural areas, who were relatively less financially privileged, in selected districts of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh in November 2024.  The sample population is  poorer  than  the  Indian  population  on  average.  This  demographic  group  was  chosen  for  study  because  an increased female labour force participation rate (FLFPR) has been observed among this group. Furthermore, as a popular target for DBTs and cash, as well as loans through SHGs from both the Centre and various state governments, a survey of this group, allows for an analysis of patterns of consumption due to cash transfers and loans.\n\n19    Jayachandran,  S.  (2021).  Social  Norms  as  a  Barrier  to  Women's  Employment  in  Developing  Countries. IMF Economic Review,69, 576-595. https://doi.org/10.1057/s41308-021-00140-w\n\n12.19.  Women  have  been  key  beneficiaries  of  various  initiatives  designed  to  foster entrepreneurship. As of 31 October 2024, a total number of 73,151 startups with at least  one  woman  director  have  been  recognised  under  the  Startup  India  Initiative. This  represents  nearly  half  of  the  1,52,139  start-ups  supported  by  the  government. ₹3,107.11  crore  has  been  invested  in  149  women-led  startups  through  Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs). 20  Since its inception in April 2021, the Start-up India Seed Fund Scheme (SISFS) has approved ₹227.12 crore in funding for  1,278  women-led startups. 21  Credit Guarantee Scheme for Startups (CGSS) 22 has guaranteed ₹24.6 crore in  loans  for  women-led  ventures. 23   These  programmes  offer  women  entrepreneurs financial support, training, and mentorship, empowering them to start and scale their businesses.\n\n## Harnessing the power of women entrepreneurs for India's economic future\n\n12.20. A  recent  World  Bank  paper  (Gupta  et  al.,  2024)  highlights  that  promoting women-owned,  growth-oriented  enterprises  could  significantly  boost  FLFPR  and economic growth in rural India. The paper emphasises the importance of providing business development services to support and enhance women's entrepreneurial efforts. 24\n\n12.21.   Of the nearly 4.96 lakh people engaged in the khadi sector, over 80 per cent are women artisans. 25  It is estimated that more than 50 per cent of persons practising sericulture are women. Out of the total workforce engaged in the handicrafts sector, an estimated 56.1 per cent are women. 26  Certain crafts, like embroidery, mat weaving, etc., are practised predominantly by women. As per the Handloom Census 2019-20, handloom activity in India is also dominated by female workers (72 per cent). 27\n\n12.22. However, the reins of ownership in entrepreneurship still remain dominantly male-held.  Only 22 per cent of all micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) are owned by women entrepreneurs. Diving further, as the size of the enterprise increases from micro to small and then to medium, women's share in ownership drops from 22 per cent to 12 per cent and further to 7 per cent, respectively. 28  However, this is not\n\n20  PIB release of Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry dated 10 December 2024 (https://tinyurl.com/yeyh54k2).\n\n21  https://seedfund.startupindia.gov.in/\n\n- 22  PIB release of Ministry of Commerce &amp; Industry dated 7 October 2022 (https://tinyurl.com/df8jxwhb)\n\n23  Ibid note 20 above\n\n- 24    Gupta,Arshia; Pinto,Alreena Renita; Madhavan Kutty, Balakrishnan.

Across India Inc., women only held 18.3 per cent of board seats in 2023. 29 Box XII.2 discusses some of the initiatives taken by the government to promote female entrepreneurship.\n\n## Box XII.2: Government initiatives to boost female entrepreneurship\n\nTo  give  a  fillip  to  women's  entrepreneurship,  various  ministries/  departments  of  the government of India have launched several initiatives, some of which are presented below.\n\n## Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises 30\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Formalisation of Enterprises 31\n\n63 per cent of the 2.41 crore enterprises formalised since January 2023 are women-owned.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Skill Development\n\nMarketing Support 32\n\nWomen's trade fair participation is fully subsidised.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## ZED Certification 34\n\nOver 21,600 women trained in coir manufacturing in 5 years; free entrepreneurial training is offered.\n\n## PM Employment Guarantee Programme 33\n\n41 per cent of loans in FY24 were sanctioned to women, with higher subsidies (25-35 per cent) and lower contributions (5 per cent).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Procurement\n\n3 per cent of procurement by CPSEs is reserved for women-owned enterprises.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Access to Credit 35\n\n100 per cent subsidy on certification for women MSMEs.\n\nWomen entrepreneurs receive 90 per cent guarantees (vs. 75 per cent for others) and reduced fees under the Credit Guarantee Scheme.\n\nOf 97.68 lakh guarantees approved, 22 per cent are for women.\n\n## Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship\n\n- 29    Deloitte Global eighth edition of Women in the Boardroom: A Global Perspective, March 2024(https://tinyurl. com/5y6u7nz4 )\n- 30  Based on inputs from M/oMSME\n- 31  https://www.sidbi.in/udyam-assist-platform\n- 32  PIB release of M/oMSME dated 12 December 2024 (https://tinyurl.com/436vvaad).\n- 33  https://tinyurl.com/bdda6tdn\n- 34  https://zed.msme.gov.in/\n- 35  https://tinyurl.com/2t9w7phe\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n32,262 women (67 per cent of beneficiaries) trained in entrepreneurship between 2021 to 2024.\n\n## Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Start-up Support 37\n\n10 per cent of the Fund of Funds for Startups is reserved for women.\n\n## Ministry of Food Processing Industries\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## PM Micro Food Processing Scheme 39\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Women Entrepreneurship Platform 38\n\nLaunched in 2018 to aggregate and showcase policies, with NSA awards recognizing women-led start-ups.\n\nMinistry of Tribal Affairs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Adivasi Mahila Sashaktikaran Yojana 40\n\nSHG members receive ₹40,000 seed capital and 50 per cent branding/marketing grants.\n\nLoans up to ₹2 lakh at 4 per cent interest for ST women.\n\n## Ministry of Cooperation 41\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNCDC Support 42\n\n₹6,426 crore disbursed for women cooperatives; 25,385 registered cooperatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Nandini Sahakar Scheme\n\n2 per cent interest subvention for innovative cooperative projects.\n\n36  https://sankalp.msde.gov.in/\n\n- 37  https://pib.gov.in/PressReleaseIframePage.aspx?PRID=1941361\n\n38  https://wep.gov.in/\n\n- 39    Launched in 2020, provides credit-linked subsidies for individuals and groups of women entrepreneurs. https:// tinyurl.com/5d5axh3u\n- 40  https://tinyurl.com/5fmen9uy\n- 41  PIB release of Ministry of Cooperation dated 4 December 2024 (https://tinyurl.com/3m34bndn).\n- 42  National Cooperative Development Corporation (NCDC)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSwayam Shakti Sahakar Yojna\n\nWorking capital loan to support women SHGs.\n\nOther flagship schemes: Besides these, certain flagship schemes of the government of India, such as Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, DAY-NRLM etc., are also oriented towards promoting women-led enterprises. Other schemes and initiatives, such as Yashasvini mass awareness campaigns, are also available for women entrepreneurship development.\n\n12.23. Building a strong ecosystem for women's entrepreneurship requires innovative solutions  alongside  government  initiatives  focusing  on  credit  access,  skill  training, and formalisation. Rural women entrepreneurs face additional challenges, including limited business skills, market access, and technology gaps, compounded by a lack of mentorship and networking. Streamlining support through credit linkages, sensitising bankers, and efficient delivery mechanisms is essential. Cost-effective strategies, such as  raising  awareness,  providing  skill  training,  and  improving  access  to  government benefits, can empower women entrepreneurs. Institutions like the Global Alliance for Mass  Entrepreneurship  (GAME)  address  systemic  barriers,  supporting  women-led MSMEs with access to markets, credit, and growth opportunities. 43\n\n12.24. NRLM partnered with GAME to empower rural women entrepreneurs through the  Women  Entrepreneur  Financial  Empowerment  Programme  (WEFEP). 44   The programme  improves  credit  access  for  rural  women  entrepreneurs  by  identifying and  supporting  aspiring  individual  rural  women  entrepreneurs  through  enterprise formalisation, business planning, and loan application processes. This is done with the support of NRLM's ground cadres like \" Vitta Sakhis .\" Vitta Sakhis guide women on loan options and assist with bank visits, documentation, and business proposals, reducing bank linkage time. Under the initiative, 862 Vitta Sakhis were trained, outreach and assessment of 20190 women entrepreneurs were done, 10713 loan applications were submitted,  2400  loans  were  sanctioned,  and  banks  disbursed  ₹30  lakh  in  loans  to rural women entrepreneurs. 45  Meanwhile, the \"Growtherator\" programme accelerates MSME growth,  fostering  profitability,  job  creation,  and  long-term  success  through mentorship and peer networks. 46\n\n12.25.  Systemic challenges such as skill gaps, compliance barriers, and limited mobility restrict women's access to digital platforms. GAME's Women Economic Empowerment (WEE)  programme  fosters  gender-responsive  policies  to  bridge  this  gap.  It  builds replicable  models  with  private  partners  for  rural  e-commerce,  social  commerce,  gig work, and job tech, enabling women entrepreneurs to participate actively in the platform\n\n43  https://massentrepreneurship.org/about/\n\n44  WEFEP was launched in 16 districts across Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Maharashtra.\n\n45  https://tinyurl.com/597jepam\n\n46  https://massentrepreneurship.org/growtherator/\n\neconomy. The programme aims to positively impact 2.5 lakh women across the digital platform economy by 2025. 47\n\n12.26. WE Hub - The Women Entrepreneurs Hub is a good example from the state of Telangana of how the support of the government can help women's entrepreneurship flourish. It is India's first state-led incubator for women entrepreneurs. 48  WE Hub was started with the mission to ensure that all women entrepreneurs in the country have access to technical, financial, governmental, and policy support required to start up, scale up, sustain, and accelerate with global market access. It has raised ₹177 crore in funding. 6376 start-ups and SMEs have been incubated. It has engaged around 7828 entrepreneurs and has launched 87 start-up programmes, and 75 per cent of the startups survive beyond 2 years. 49\n\n12.27.  As women continue to overcome challenges and dismantle barriers, their progress drives  empowerment, creates job opportunities and builds the foundation for more inclusive economic growth. The growing participation of women in entrepreneurship can propel the country towards higher levels of development by tapping into their latent potential to contribute to economic activities.\n\n## Trends in wages and earnings\n\n12.28. The 2023-24 PLFS results provide earnings data segmented by status (regular/ salaried, casual, and self-employed workers), gender and location (urban and rural). The average monthly earnings of workers vary across different segments. While the average monthly earnings for regular wage/salaried workers and self-employed workers grew at a CAGR of 5 per cent during the period 2018-19 to 2023-24, the daily wage of casual workers increased at a CAGR of 9 per cent during the same period.  Earnings for selfemployed workers showcased a dynamic trajectory, with a brief dip from 2017-18 to 2020-21, followed by a significant rebound post-pandemic. Nominal wages have shown good growth across all categories, outpacing growth in real wages.\n\n47  https://tinyurl.com/mushjrd7\n\n48  https://invest.telangana.gov.in/we-hub/\n\n49  Data as of 19 December 2024 (https://wehub.telangana.gov.in/  )\n\nTable XII.1: Average earnings segmented by employment status, gender and location (for 2023-24)\n\n| ₹ Nominal         | Rural   | Rural   | Rural   | Urban   | Urban   | Urban   | Total   | Total   | Total   |\n|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| Value             | Male    | Female  | Person  | Male    | Female  | Person  | Male    | Female  | Person  |\n| Self- employed 50 | 13,907  | 4,907   | 11,422  | 22,930  | 8,489   | 20,055  | 16,007  | 5,497   | 13,279  |\n| Regular 51        | 18,029  | 11,914  | 16,626  | 25,501  | 19,709  | 23,974  | 22,092  | 16,498  | 20,702  |\n| Casual 52         | 434     | 290     | 402     | 529     | 354     | 506     | 450     | 296     | 418     |\n\nNote:1.

As per data of Labour Bureau 56 , in FY25 (April- September 2024), rural wages rose  at  above-4  per  cent  every  month,  YoY.  On  average,  the  nominal  wage  rate  in agriculture grew by 5.7 per cent for men and 7 per cent for women. In non-agricultural activities, nominal wage growth was slightly lower for men, at 5.5 per cent, but higher for women, at 7.9 per cent during the same period.\n\n12.30. When  adjusted  for  inflation,  the  real  wage  rate  in  agriculture  demonstrated modest growth, increasing by 0.6 per cent for men and 1.8 per cent for women.

These trends highlight a steady improvement in real wages for rural workers, with women experiencing a comparatively stronger increase.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Wages in unincorporated sector enterprises\n\n12.31.   As per the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) results for 2023-24 57 , the average emolument per hired worker rose by 13 per cent in 202324 compared to 2022-23, with the average emolument per hired worker rising from ₹1,24,842 in 2022-23 to ₹1,41,071 in 2023-24, signalling improved wage levels 58 This growth, led by a 16.1 per cent increase in the manufacturing sector average emolument per hired worker, is strengthening the labour market, boosting productivity, and driving economic demand.\n\n12.32. The ASUSE 2023-24 results highlight the notable labour market improvements of  the  non-agricultural  unincorporated  sectors,  with  hired  workers  increasing  from 2.95 crore in 2022-23 to 3.15 crore in 2023-24, reflecting healthy employment growth.\n\n57  The period for the survey is October 2023 to September 2024.\n\n58    ASUSE conducted by NSSO, is a survey of unincorporated non-agricultural establishments belonging to three sectors viz., Manufacturing, Trade and Other Services. Ownership-wise, this Survey covers unincorporated nonagricultural establishments pertaining to proprietorship, partnership (excluding limited liability partnerships), self-help groups, cooperatives, societies/trusts etc (https://tinyurl.com/b9k4apur).\n\n12.33. Beyond  wage  trends,  examining  corporate  profits  and  wage  share  is  crucial to  understanding  how  income  distribution  between  labour  and  capital  influences productivity, competitiveness, and sustainable growth. The same has been discussed in Box XII.3 .\n\n## Box XII.3: Corporate Profitability Hits 15-Year High even as wage growth moderates\n\nCorporate  profitability  soared  to  a  15-year  peak  in  FY24,  fuelled  by  robust  growth  in financials, energy, and automobiles. Among Nifty 500 companies, the profit-to-GDP ratio surged from 2.1 per cent in FY03 to 4.8 per cent in FY24, the highest since FY08. 59  Large corporations, especially in non-financial sectors, significantly outperformed their smaller peers in profitability.\n\nHowever, while profits surged, wages lagged. A striking disparity has emerged in corporate India: profits climbed 22.3 per cent in FY24, but employment grew by a mere 1.5 per cent. 60 State Bank of India (SBI) analysis reveals that 4,000 listed companies recorded a modest 6  per  cent  revenue  growth.  At  the  same  time,  employee  expenses  rose  only  13  per  cent -down from 17 per cent in FY23 - highlighting a sharp focus on cost-cutting over workforce expansion. 61\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDespite Indian companies achieving a stable EBITDA margin of 22 per cent over the last four years, wage growth has moderated. This uneven growth trajectory raises critical concerns. Wage stagnation is pronounced, particularly at entry-level IT positions.\n\n59  India Strategy.Nifty-50: 23,290. 10 June 2024. Motilal Oswal Financial Services (https://tinyurl.com/9xxbkrkp)\n\n60  Ibid note 59 above\n\n61  State Bank of India. (2024). Contours of inflation (https://tinyurl.com/53a5scd5 )\n\nWhile the labour share of GVA shows a slight uptick, the disproportionate rise in corporate profits-predominantly  among  large  firms-raises  concerns  about  income  inequality.  A higher profit share and stagnant wage growth risk slowing the economy by curbing demand. Sustained economic growth hinges on bolstering employment incomes, which directly fuel consumer spending, spurring investment in production capacity.\n\nTo secure long-term stability, a fair and reasonable distribution of income between capital and labour is imperative. It is essential for sustaining demand and supporting corporate revenue and profitability growth in the medium to long run.\n\nJapan succeeded in industrialisation  and  in  becoming  a  developed  economy,  despite  its defeat  in  WW  II  through  a  social  contract  between  the  government,  the  businesses  and workers, write Matthew C. Klein and Michael Pettis in 'Trade Wars are Class Wars':\n\n' Japanese  workers,  consumers,  and  retirees  all  subsidised  industrial  development  by overpaying  for  goods  and  services,  by  taking  home  a  lower  share  of  national  output than their counterparts in the West, and by using a financial system designed to transfer purchasing  power  from  households  to  businesses.  Japanese  companies  returned  the favour by upgrading the country's manufacturing base, passing along productivity gains to workers, and refraining from excessive executive pay, while the government invested in top-tier infrastructure. '\n\n## Employment in factories\n\n12.34. The  Annual  Survey  of  Industries  (ASI)  results  for  the  FY23 62 highlight  the manufacturing  sector's  resilience,  showing  a  more  than  7  per  cent  increase  in employment over the previous year. 63  This translates into an addition of over 22 lakh jobs in FY 23 over FY 19 (pre-pandemic level), underscoring the sector's robust postpandemic recovery. 64  During the pandemic in FY 21, the sector lost approximately 5 lakh jobs. The growth of the sector in FY 23 indicates a strong rebound of the sector as economic conditions improved.\n\n62  Reference period of the survey is April 2022 to March 2023.\n\n63    The ASI, conducted by the MoSPI, covers the organised manufacturing sector. Its coverage extends to the entire Factory Sector comprising industrial units (called factories) registered under the Sections 2(m)(i) and 2(m)(ii) of the Factories Act, 1948, with ten or more workers with electricity or twenty or more workers without electricity. (https://www.mospi.gov.in/sites/default/files/asi\\_results/ASI  per  cent20Summary  per  cent20Results  per cent202022-23.pdf)\n\n64    It may be noted that employment refers to total persons engaged (TPE), which includes the employees (which include workers and clerical/administrative staff) and all working proprietors and their family members who are actively engaged in the work of the factory even without any pay, and the unpaid members of the cooperative societies who worked in or for the factory in any direct and productive capacity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource: ASI report, MoSPI\n\nNote: TPE: Total Persons Engaged\n\n12.35.  The results of ASI FY23 indicate a continued increase in the number of large factories i.e., those employing more than 100 workers.  The number of such factories saw a robust growth of 7 per cent compared to FY22, while small factories (employing fewer than 100 workers) also experienced a steady increase of 2 per cent. Notably, large factories now account for around 22 per cent of all operational factories, reflecting their growing presence and contribution to the industrial landscape.\n\n12.36. In terms of the share of employment, large factories continue to employ about 80 per cent of the total workers 65 and 78 per cent of the TPE 66  in the sector, whereas small factories, although larger in number, comprise a smaller share of employment in the sector.\n\n12.37.  Seven industry groups in the sector contribute to around 54 per cent of the total employment. These are food products, textiles, basic metals, wearing apparel, motor vehicles, trailers and semi-trailers, machinery and equipment N.E.C., and chemicals and chemical products. Other than these leading industries, industry groups representing computer, electronic and optical products and the manufacture of furniture have seen strong growth in employment compared to the pre-pandemic level with around 50 per cent growth in TPE. This indicates a positive shift towards electronics manufacturing in India.\n\n65    Workers  are  directly  involved  in  the  manufacturing  process  or  in  activities  incidental  to  the  manufacturing process, such as cleaning and repair. They can be employed directly or through an agency.\n\n66  Ibid note 64 above.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Growing formal sector in India\n\n12.38. Formalisation of the job market, as reflected in payroll data from the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), indicates that government initiatives are helping foster  greater  economic  formalisation. 67 Net  additions  to  EPFO  subscriptions  have more than doubled, rising from 61 lakh in FY19 to 131 lakh in FY24. During the first eight  months of  FY25  (April  to  November  2024),  cumulative  net  additions  reached 95.6 lakh, marking a 3 per cent YoY increase compared to the 92.9 lakh recorded during the same period in FY24. EPFO membership stands at 32.7 crore as of March 2024, compared to 29.9 crore as of March 2023.\n\n67    The EPFO data covers the low-paid workers in medium and large formal sector establishments. EPFO publishes subscription data every month, with a lag of two months.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\nSource: EPFO\n\nNote: Net addition in payroll = No. of new subscribers + No. of exited members who re-joined - No. of members exited\n\n12.39. In  terms  of  industrial  composition,  expert  services  form  the  largest  share  of EPFO payroll addition (50 per cent in FY25, April-November), followed by tradingother  industries  (12  per  cent)  and  trading-commercial  establishments  (7  per  cent). Over the years, expert services have consistently led in formal job creation, as reflected in net payroll additions.\n\n12.40. Across age groups, the age group of 18-25 years contributed to 47 per cent of the net payroll addition in April-November 2024. With nearly 61 per cent of net payroll addition coming from less than 29 years of age (in the same period), new jobs in the organised sector are mainly going to the youth.\n\n12.41.  The eShram portal 68 , was launched by the Ministry of Labour and Employment (MoLE) on 26 August 2021 to recognise unorganised workers. The portal helps register and support unorganised workers by providing them with a Universal Account Number (UAN) and for  the  creation  of  a  comprehensive  National  Database  of  Unorganised Workers (NDUW). 69  As of 31 December 2024, over 30.51 crore unorganised workers have already registered on the eShram portal.\n\n12.42. Further, in keeping with the vision of developing eShram as a One-Stop-Solution for unorganised labour to have access to various social sector schemes, MoLE launched the eShram- 'One-Stop-Solution' on 21 October 2024, which entails the integration of different social security/ welfare schemes on a single portal, i.e., eShram. This enables unorganised workers registered on eShram to access social security schemes and see benefits availed by them so far through eShram.
