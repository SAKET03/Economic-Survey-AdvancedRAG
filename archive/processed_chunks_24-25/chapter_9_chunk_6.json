  "content": "Chapter 9 Summary:\nThe agricultural sector in India has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23. The sector contributes approximately 16% of the country's GDP and supports about 46.1% of the population. In the second quarter of FY25, the agriculture sector recorded a growth rate of 3.5%, representing a recovery compared to the previous four quarters. The growth rate can be attributed to improved conditions, potentially driven by favorable weather patterns, advancements in agricultural practices, and government initiatives to enhance productivity and sustainability within the sector. Assured remunerative prices, improved access to institutional credit, crop diversification, support for sustainable practices, and enhancement in productivity have played a crucial role in the sustained growth observed. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, reassuring them of a guaranteed minimum price for their crops. The government has also introduced the Per Drop More Crop (PDMC) initiative to promote water efficiency and the use of drones and fertigation techniques to optimize fertilizer applications. The Kisan Credit Card (KCC) scheme has been introduced to enable farmers to meet their short-term working capital requirements promptly and hassle-free. The government has also launched the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) to provide insurance for farmers against crop losses due to natural calamities, pests, and diseases. The agricultural extension services have been strengthened to disseminate knowledge, enhance productivity, and promote sustainable agricultural practices. The government has also promoted private investment in agricultural marketing infrastructure through initiatives such as the Agriculture Marketing Infrastructure (AMI) sub-scheme. The food processing industry in India is one of the largest employers within organized manufacturing, accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated several key programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI). The government has also implemented various initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY). India's agricultural sector remains a crucial pillar for economic growth and ensuring food security for the nation, with significant potential for growth and development.\n\nSubchapter 6 Content:\n# Agriculture Credit: A Critical Input\n\nAGRICULTURE CREDIT: A critical input\n\n9.23 Providing adequate credit support to all farmers, especially small and marginal farmers  and  vulnerable  sections  of  society,  is  crucial  to  improving  agricultural productivity and income.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.24 The Government of India introduced the Kisan Credit  Card  (KCC)  to  enable farmers to meet their short-term working capital requirements promptly and hasslefree. This has helped enhance the working capital flow to agriculture and allied sectors. As of March 2024, the country has 7.75 crore operational KCC accounts with a loan outstanding of ₹9.81 lakh crore. KCC was further extended to meet the working capital needs  of  fisheries  and  animal  husbandry  in  2018-19,  along  with  the  enhancement\n\n25    Narayanamoorthy, A., Jothi, P., Suresh, R., &amp; Sujith, K.

As  of  31  March  2024,  1.24  lakh KCC and 44.40 lakh KCC were issued to fisheries and animal husbandry activities, respectively.\n\n9.25  In addition to interventions such as the Modified Interest Subvention Scheme (MISS),  which  provides  short-term  agri-loans  through  KCC  for  working  capital requirements at the concessional interest rate of 7 per cent, the Prompt Repayment Incentive (PRI) provides a 3 per cent incentive to farmers who repay on time. Starting from FY25, the claim processing has been digitised through the Kisan Rin Portal for faster and more efficient capturing and settlement of MISS claims.\n\n9.26  To further support small and marginal farmers, banks must allocate 40 per cent of their Adjusted Net Bank Credit (ANBC) or Credit Equivalent Amount of Off-Balance Sheet Exposure (CEOBE), whichever is higher, to priority sectors, including agriculture. All  the  above  measures  have  significantly  reduced  the  reliance  on  non-institutional credit sources from 90 per cent in 1950 to around 25.0 per cent in FY22 27 .\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.27 Ground-level credit (GLC) to agriculture has also shown impressive growth with a CAGR of 12.98 per cent from 2014-15 to 2024-25. The GLC has risen from ₹8.45 lakh crore in 2014-15 to ₹25.48 lakh crore in 2023-24. Within this, the share of small and marginal farmers has significantly increased from ₹3.46 lakh crore (41 per cent) to ₹14.39 lakh crore (57 per cent) from 2014-15 to 2023-24.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Ministry of Agriculture\n\n## BOX IX.4 : Kisan Rin Portal: Streamlining Agri Credit for Farmers' Prosperity\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Kisan Rin Portal (KRP) launched in September 2023 addresses key challenges in the Modified Interest Subvention- Kisan Credit Card (MISS-KCC) scheme. Previously, banks had to submit claims for Interest Subvention (IS) and Prompt Repayment Incentive (PRI) manually to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and NABARD, leading to significant delays and inefficiencies. The Kisan Rin Portal digitises this process, ensuring farmers and lending institutions  benefit  from  quicker,  seamless  transactions,  improving  access  to  credit  for agricultural needs.\n\n- Empowering Farmers with Seamless Access to Credit: The portal simplifies the process, enabling access to low-cost credit not only for traditional cropping activities but also for dairy, poultry, fisheries, and beekeeping.\n- Benefiting  Financial  Institutions:  Banks  and  Cooperatives: With  the  portal, banks  can  submit  automated  digital  claims,  streamlining  the  entire  process.  This  not only improves efficiency but also helps banks track and manage claims more effectively, facilitating prompt disbursal of benefits.\n- Reaching the Grassroots: Training and Support: The KRP's impact extends to over 453 banks nationwide, with 1.89 lakh branches and 4.65 lakh users actively involved in processing claims.\n- Current Success and Achievements: By 31 December 2024, it had processed claims worth  ₹108336.78  crore  including  Interest  Subvention  (IS)  and  PRI.  About  5.9  crore farmers that are currently getting benefitted under the MISS-KCC scheme, have been mapped through KRP.\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt;\n\n9.28 The government also provides insurance for farmers through the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY). This scheme acts as a safety net for farmers against crop losses  due  to  natural  calamities,  pests,  and  diseases.  As  the  largest  crop  insurance program in the world in terms of farmer enrolment and the third-largest by premiums, PMFBY  offers  comprehensive  risk  coverage  from  the  pre-sowing  to  post-harvest stages. By ensuring financial stability, the scheme encourages farmers to adopt modern agricultural practices and technologies, ultimately enhancing agricultural productivity and  food  security.  In  response  to  recommendations  from  various  committees,  the scheme has recently launched several technological interventions, such as YES-TECH, WINDS, and CROPIC 28 . These advancements have increased transparency within the scheme ecosystem by minimizing human intervention and fostering greater trust among stakeholders,  including  implementing  States/UTs  and  and  insurance  companies.  The participation of State governments and insurers has increased to 24 and 15, respectively, in  FY25,  up  from  20  and  11  in  the  2020-21.  Additionally,  these  interventions  have contributed to a 32 per cent reduction in premium rates compared to previous years. As a result, in the FY24 period, the number of enrolled farmers reached 4 crore, a 26 per cent increase from 3.17 crore in the FY23 period. The insured area also expanded to 600 lakh hectares in FY24, reflecting a 19 per cent rise from 500 lakh hectares in FY23. Both the acreage and farmer enrolment figures under the scheme are at an all-time high.\n\n##",
