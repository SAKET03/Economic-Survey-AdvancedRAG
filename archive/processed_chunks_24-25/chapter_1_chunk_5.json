  "content": "Chapter 1 Summary:\nThe global economy exhibited steady yet uneven growth across regions in 2024. The slowdown in global manufacturing, especially in Europe and parts of Asia, was due to supply chain disruptions and weak external demand. In contrast, the services sector performed better, supporting growth in many economies. Inflationary pressures eased in most economies, but services inflation remained persistent. Commodity prices stabilized, but the risk of synchronised price increases persists. Central banks may chart varying paths of monetary easing, leading to uncertainty over future policy rates and inflation trajectories. Geopolitical tensions, ongoing conflicts, and trade policy risks continue to pose significant challenges to global economic stability. India's economy displayed steady growth, with real GDP estimated to grow by 6.4% in FY25. Growth in the first half of FY25 was supported by agriculture and services, with rural demand improving due to record Kharif production and favorable agricultural conditions. The manufacturing sector faced pressures due to weak global demand and domestic seasonal conditions. Private consumption remained stable, reflecting steady domestic demand. Fiscal discipline and strong external balance supported by a services trade surplus and healthy remittance growth contributed to macroeconomic stability. India's economic prospects for FY26 are balanced, with headwinds including elevated geopolitical and trade uncertainties and possible commodity price shocks. Domestically, the translation of order books of the private capital goods sector into sustained investment pick-up, improvements in consumer confidence, and corporate wage pick-up will be key to promoting growth. Rural demand backed by a rebound in agricultural production, anticipated easing of food inflation, and a stable macro-economic environment provide an upside to near-term growth. India will need to improve its global competitiveness through grassroots-level structural reforms and deregulation to reinforce its medium-term growth potential. The global economy grew by 3.3% in 2023, with the IMF projecting growth of 3.2% and 3.3% for 2024 and 2025, respectively. Global growth is expected to average around 3.2% over the next five years. Advanced economies witnessed stable growth in the first half of 2024, but growth varies across regions. The US is expected to grow at 2.8% in 2024, while the Euro Area is expected to grow at 0.8% in 2024 and 1.0% in 2025. India's real GDP growth for FY25 is estimated to be 6.4%, with private final consumption expenditure growing by 7.3%. Gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) is estimated to grow by 6.4%. The services sector is expected to grow at 7.2% in FY25. The agriculture sector is expected to rebound to a growth of 3.8% in FY25. The industrial sector is estimated to grow by 6.2% in FY25. Construction activities and electricity, gas, water supply, and other utility services are expected to support industrial expansion. The services sector continues to perform well, driven by healthy activity in financial, real estate, professional services, public administration, defense, and other services. The analysis of growth trends is based on the trends in the first half (H1) of FY25. Aggregate GVA surpassed its pre-pandemic trend in Q1 FY25 and now hovers above the trend in H1 FY25. The agriculture sector remains strong, consistently operating well above trend levels. The industrial sector has also found its footing above the pre-pandemic trajectory. The robust rate of growth in recent years has taken the services sector close to its trend levels. Construction has been a standout, gaining momentum since mid-FY21 and soaring approximately 15% above its pre-pandemic trend. Manufacturing, while steadily recovering, remains slightly below its pre-pandemic trajectory. Mining continues to operate below its pre-pandemic trend. The recovery within the services sector has been uneven. Financial, real estate, and professional services have taken the lead, surpassing pre-pandemic trend levels. Public administration, defense, and other services followed suit, exceeding the trend for the first time in Q1 of FY25. Trade, hotels, transport, and communication services are gradually catching up with the pre-pandemic trend. The real GVA grew by 6.2% in H1 FY25, driven by a strong growth momentum in Q1 FY25 and a subdued performance in Q2 FY25. The agriculture and services sectors emerged as key growth drivers during this period. However, the overall growth was tempered by moderation in industrial growth, particularly in manufacturing, which faced challenges from slowing global demand and supply chain disruptions. Agriculture growth remained steady in H1 FY25, with Q2 recording a growth rate of 3.5%. Healthy Kharif production, above-normal monsoons, and an adequate reservoir level supported agricultural growth. The estimated increase in Kharif food grain production is mainly on account of the rise in rice, maize, coarse grains, and oilseeds output. A normal southwest monsoon in 2024 has improved the water levels in reservoirs, ensuring sufficient water for irrigation during the rabi crop production. As of 10 January 2025, rabi sowing of wheat and gram was 1.4% and 0.8% higher, respectively, compared to the previous year. Improved agricultural prospects also bode well for softening of food inflation pressures over the course of the year. The industrial sector grew by 6% in H1 FY25, with Q1 seeing a strong growth of 8.3%, but growth moderated in Q2. The moderation in growth can be attributed to three key factors: slowing global demand, the impact of above-average monsoon on certain sectors, and variation in the timing of festivities. Disaggregated data reveals that while many manufacturing sub-sectors experienced growth, others faced challenges, likely due to global and seasonal factors. The services sector continues to perform well in FY25, with a notable growth in Q1 and Q2 resulting in 7.1% growth in H1 FY25. Across sub-categories, all the sub-sectors have performed well. The robust performance of the services sector is also reflected in high-frequency indicators (HFIs). PMI services have been in an expansionary zone during H1 FY25, supported by growth in new orders, rise in output, improvement in sales, and enhanced employment generation. India's GDP at constant (2011-12) prices grew by 6.7% and 5.4% in Q1 and Q2 FY25, respectively. This implied a real GDP growth of 6.0% in the first half of the current fiscal. From a demand perspective, Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) firmed up in H1 FY25, growing by 6.7% YoY. Indicators such as 2-wheeler and 3-wheeler sales and tractor sales signal that rural demand contributed to private consumption growth. Rural demand is expected to continue in the second half of the fiscal year with the returns from a bumper Kharif crop and higher MSPs for a prospectively good Rabi crop. Urban demand presented mixed trends, with passenger vehicle sales slowing to 4.2% YoY in April-November 2024. Fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sales in urban areas recorded a moderate growth in H1FY25. However, there is steady growth of 7.7% YoY in air passenger traffic in April-November 2024. The moderation in real GDP growth can be traced to a softening of growth in Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) from 10.1% in H1 FY24 to 6.4% in H1 FY25. The slowdown in investment activity is likely temporary, with green shoots in capital formation visible. Union government capex is up 8.2% in July-November 2024 and is expected to pick up further pace. Early results of the RBI's Order Books, Inventory, and Capacity Utilisation Survey (OBICUS) show that the seasonally adjusted capacity utilisation (CU) in manufacturing firms was 74.7% in Q2 FY25, above the long-term average of 73.8%. A private sector report's analysis of a sample of capital goods companies indicates that the order books of these companies have registered a sharp increase of 23.6% in FY24. In H1 FY25, there has been a growth of 10.3% compared to the end of FY24. The RBI's report on private investments showed that investment intentions increased to ₹2.45 lakh crore for FY25 as compared to ₹1.6 lakh crore for FY24. On the external front, exports of goods and non-factor services at constant prices increased by 5.6% in H1 FY25, while imports increased by 0.7%. India's external sector displayed mixed trends, primarily due to volatile global conditions. Merchandise exports grew by 1.6% YoY in April-December 2024, while non-petroleum exports were up by 7.1%. Services trade surplus has lent balance to the overall trade deficit. India's robust services exports have propelled the country to secure the seventh-largest share in global services exports. Remittances from abroad led to a healthy net inflow of private transfers, with India being the top recipient of remittances in the world. The current account deficit (CAD) remains relatively contained at 1.2% of GDP in Q2 FY25. Comfortable financing of the CAD by the capital account has ensured external sector stability. Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows increased 17.9% YoY in April-November 2024. Net FDI inflow declined over this period, primarily on account of the uptick in repatriation. Foreign portfolio investment (FPI) flows have been volatile in the second half of 2024. Net FPI inflows slowed to USD 10.6 billion in April-December 2024 from USD 31.7 billion during the same period the previous year. India's foreign exchange reserves increased from USD 616.7 billion at the end of January 2024 to USD 704.9 billion in September 2024 before moderating to USD 634.6 billion as on 3 January 2025. The banking and financial sector remains stable and well-capitalised, catering to the financing needs of the economy. Credit disbursal by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) is growing in double-digits, but there has been a moderation in the growth in recent months. The gross non-performing assets (NPAs) in the banking system have declined to a 12-year low of 2.6% of gross loans and advances. The capital-to-risk-weighted assets ratio (CRAR) for SCBs stands at 16.7% as of September 2024, well above the norm. The profitability of SCBs improved during H1 FY25, with profit after tax (PAT) surging by 22.2% YoY. India's labour market growth in recent years has been supported by post-pandemic recovery and increased formalisation. The unemployment rate for individuals aged 15 years and above has steadily declined from 6% in 2017-18 to 3.2% in 2023-24. The labour force participation rate (LFPR) and the worker-to-population ratio (WPR) have also increased. Net Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) subscriptions more than doubled from 61 lakh in FY19 to 131 lakh in FY24. In April-November 2024, net additions reached 95.6 lakh, driven largely by youth. The near-term global growth is expected to be a shade lower than the trend level. Inflationary pressures have been easing globally, though risks of synchronised price pressures linger due to potential geopolitical disruptions. Central banks have adopted more accommodative monetary policies. Rebounding rural demand augurs well for consumption. Investment activity is expected to pick up, supported by higher public capex and improving business expectations. Food inflation is likely to soften in Q4 FY25 with the seasonal easing of vegetable prices and Kharif harvest arrivals. Good Rabi production is likely to contain food prices in the first half of FY26. The growth in FY26 would be between 6.3 and 6.8%.\n\nSubchapter 5 Content:\n# Economy Characterised by Stability and Inclusivity on Multiple Fronts\n\nECONOMY CHARACTERISED BY STABILITY AND INCLUSIVITY ON MULTIPLE FRONTS\n\n## Improving public finances support macro stability\n\n1.43 Since the COVID-19 pandemic, judicious fiscal management has helped to rein in general government dis-savings (Chart I.33). This assumes greater significance in sustaining the overall savings in the economy. With private corporate savings hovering around  14  per  cent  of  GDP,  persistent  general  government  dis-savings  could  have implied a greater reliance on foreign funding. Prudent fiscal management in the last four  years  kept  the  overall  savings-investment  gap  from  widening  and  ensured  a comfortable financing of the current account deficit, even though the household saving rate moderated. (Chart I.34 below).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fiscal discipline of the union government\n\n1.44 The Union government's indicators of fiscal discipline have improved progressively. Quality  of  expenditure  approximated  by  capital  expenditure  as  a  per  cent  of  total expenditure of the union, has continuously improved since FY21.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.45  During April - November 2024 (Chart I.36 below), three major facts stand out in union finances. First, following an unprecedented expansion of capital expenditure in the last four years, it remained subdued during Q1 FY25, owing to general elections. However, it rebounded after July despite a reduction in non-debt receipts owing to an increase in the devolution of taxes to states. Until November 2024, defence, railways and road transport accounted for about 75 per cent of the capital expenditure, whereas significant YoY growth occurred in power and food and public distribution. Second, despite the gross tax revenue (GTR)  increasing  by  10.7  per  cent  YoY  during  April-November  2024,  the  tax  revenue retained by the Union, net of devolution to the states, hardly increased. This was because of increased tax devolution, which helped the states to manage their expenditures smoothly. Thirdly, as of November, the deficit indicators of the union were comfortably placed, leaving ample room for developmental and capital expenditure in the rest of the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: CGA monthly provisional accounts.\n\nNote: GTR- Gross Tax Revenue; NRR-Revenue Receipts (net to Centre); NTC-Tax revenue (net to Centre); NDR-Non-debt receipts; TD-Tax devolution to States; RE-Revenue Expenditure; IP-Interest Payments; CECapital Expenditure; TE-Total Expenditure; FD-Fiscal Deficit; RD-Revenue Deficit; PD-Primary Deficit.\n\n## Varying patterns in state finances\n\n1.46  A  review  of  preliminary  unaudited  estimates  of  27  states 23 for  the  period  April  November 2024 24  corroborates the second point above (Chart I.37). The GTR of the union and own tax revenue (OTR) of the states have increased at comparable pace during this period. However, the overall tax revenue position of the state governments appears better as of November, because of increased tax devolution by the union. Among the state-specific taxes, stamps and registration, sales tax, state excise duties, and other taxes and duties registered positive growth, whereas land revenue 25 declined, for states as a collective (Chart I.38).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; GLYPH&lt;c=3,font=/YQNKUC+Calibri&gt; 1.47  For 15 states 28 , OTR accounted for more than half of their total tax receipts (Chart I.39), the highest being Telangana at 88 per cent, followed by Karnataka and Haryana at 86 per cent each. Further, states with a higher ratio of own revenue receipts (ORR) to total revenue receipts also tended to have relatively lower ratios of revenue deficit to total revenue receipts (Chart I.40).\n\n23 Andhra  Pradesh  (AP),  Arunachal  Pradesh  (AR),  Assam  (AS),  Bihar  (BR),  Chhattisgarh  (CG),  Gujarat  (GJ), Haryana (HR), Himachal Pradesh (HP), Jharkhand (JH), Karnataka (KA), Kerala (KL), Madhya Pradesh (MP), Maharashtra (MH), Manipur (MN), Meghalaya (ML), Mizoram (MZ), Nagaland (NL), Odisha (OD), Punjab (PB), Rajasthan (RJ), Sikkim (SK), Tamil Nadu (TN), Telangana (TS), Tripura (TR), Uttar Pradesh (UP), Uttarakhand (UK) and West Bengal (WB).\n\n24 April to July reference period for Jharkhand; April to September for Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur. 25 Land revenue for Himachal Pradesh included in 'other taxes and duties'.\n\n26 Share of central taxes for Mizoram and Sikkim included in 'other taxes and duties'.\n\n27 Ibid.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.48 For 23 States 29 , GST was the main source of revenue amongst ORR with the greatest reliance thereon by Manipur and Nagaland at 78 per cent and 72 per cent, respectively (Chart I.41). States garnering the highest shares in respective ORRs w.r.t. stamps &amp; registration, sales tax and state excise duties were Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, respectively. Odisha exhibited the highest share of non-tax revenue in ORR at 49 per cent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.49 The revenue expenditure of the states grew at 12 per cent (YoY) during April to November 2024 (Chart I.42), with subsidies and committed liabilities 30  registering a growth of 25.7 per cent and 10.4 per cent, respectively (Chart I.43). With expenditure on capital account for states declining by 5.6 per cent, total expenditure grew by 9.5 per cent. However, 11 states witnessed an increase in capex.\n\n1.50 In the quality of expenditure, measured by capital outlay as a per cent of revenue expenditure over the five years ending FY24, states 31  exhibited considerable variation (Chart I.44).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n30 Interest  payments,  salary  and  pension.  For  Mizoram  and  Sikkim,  expenditure  on  pension  and  subsidy;  for Karnataka  and  Tamil  Nadu,  expenditure  on  salaries  &amp;  wages  and  subsidies;  and  for  Arunachal  Pradesh, expenditure on subsidies included in 'other expenditure on revenue account'.\n\n31  28 states.\n\n1.51  In April-November 2024, 11 States maintained revenue surplus (Chart I.45).The chart shows that revenue surplus (or lower revenue deficit) is corrleated with higher capital expenditure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: CAG monthly provisional accounts. Excludes Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland.\n\nNote: The size and colour of the bubble represents capital expenditure as a per cent of total expenditure (TE) red for less than 7 per cent, yellow for 7 to 14 per cent and green for 14 to 21 per cent.\n\n## Inflation - a combination of low and stable core inflation with volatile food prices\n\n1.52  Retail headline inflation, as measured by the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), has softened from 5.4 per cent in FY24 to 4.9 per cent in April - December 2024. The decline is attributed to a 0.9 percentage point reduction in core (non-food, nonfuel) inflation between FY24 and April - December 2024. While the average inflation in  FY25  has  trended  downward,  monthly  volatility  in  food  prices  and  a  select  few commodities have been responsible for CPI inflation printing towards the upper side of the tolerance band of 4 (+/-) 2 per cent.\n\n1.53  Pressures in food prices have been driven by factors such as supply chain disruptions and vagaries in weather conditions. Food inflation, measured by the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI), has increased from 7.5 per cent in FY24 to 8.4 per cent in FY25 (April-December), primarily driven by a few food items such as vegetables and pulses. Chart I.47 plots headline retail inflation excluding the following commodities - tomato, onion and potato, (TOP). These commodities together constitute 2.2 per cent of the CPI basket.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## External  sector  stability  safeguarded  by  services  trade  and  record remittances\n\n1.54 India's  external  sector  displayed  mixed  trends,  primarily  due  to  volatile  global conditions.  A  decline  in  commodity  prices  affected  India's  merchandise  exports through the petroleum goods channel. Data on merchandise trade shows that India's merchandise exports grew by 1.6 per cent YoY in April - December 2024. 33  However, non-petroleum exports (on the same comparison basis) were up by 7.1 per cent. Nonpetroleum  and  non-gems  and  jewellery  exports  rose  by  9.1  per  cent.  Merchandise imports rose by 5.2 per cent. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in nonoil, non-gold imports. Gold imports also grew, influenced by higher global prices, early purchases ahead of festive spending, and demand for safe-haven assets.\n\n1.55  While the outpacing of merchandise imports over merchandise exports widened India's merchandise trade deficit, India's services trade surplus has lent balance to the overall trade deficit. India's robust services exports have propelled the country to secure the seventh-largest share in global services exports, underscoring its competitiveness\n\n32 Further, if gold and silver are also excluded, CPI inflation excluding these five commodities (which constitute 3.4 per cent of the CPI basket) is even lower.\n\n33 https://www.commerce.gov.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/PIB-Release\\_15012025-final.pdf.\n\nin this critical sector. In addition to the services trade surplus, remittances from abroad led to a healthy net inflow of private transfers. As per the World Bank, India was the top recipient of remittances in the world, driven by an uptick in job creation in OECD economies. 34  These two factors combined to ensure that India's current account deficit (CAD) remains relatively contained at 1.2 per cent of GDP in Q2 FY25.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.56 Comfortable financing of the CAD by the capital account has ensured external sector  stability.  Within  capital  flows,  gross  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  inflows increased 17.9 per cent YoY in April - November 2024. Gross FDI inflows during April - November in FY25 are higher than the levels witnessed in the corresponding period of any previous years except FY21. Net FDI inflow declined over this period, primarily on account of the uptick in repatriation, which is higher by 33.2 per cent YoY after a  growth of  51.5  per  cent  in  FY24.  The  rise  in  repatriation  through  the  channels  of secondary sales and Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) by multinational companies amid strong stock market performance points to investor confidence in profitable exits for direct investors. 35\n\n34 World Bank. (2024, June 26). In 2024, remittance flows to low- and middle-income countries are expected to reach $685 billion, larger than FDI and ODA combined. https://tinyurl.com/38esxhzr.\n\n35 'Behind  India's  growth  over  last  10  yrs-increase  in  repatriations,  steady  FDI  inflows'.  https://tinyurl. com/2tt3pxsf.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.57  On  the  other  hand,  foreign  portfolio  investment  (FPI)  flows  have  been  volatile in the second half of 2024, primarily on account of global geopolitical and monetary policy developments. Net FPI inflows slowed to USD 10.6 billion in April - December 2024 from USD 31.7 billion during the same period the previous year. The inclusion of India's sovereign government securities (G-secs) of certain tenors in the JP Morgan EM Bond Index induced heightened activity within the debt segment of the FPIs. Further elucidation of the impact of the inclusion of Indian G-secs in global bond indices can be seen in Chapter 3.\n\n1.58 As a result of stable capital flows, India's foreign exchange reserves increased from USD 616.7 billion at the end of January 2024 to USD 704.9 billion in September 2024 before moderating to USD 634.6 billion as on 3 January 2025. India's forex reserves are sufficient to cover 90 per cent of external debt and provide an import cover of more than ten months, thereby safeguarding against external vulnerabilities.\n\n1.59 Looking ahead, global policy changes could influence India's external trade. The evolving trade stance of a few major economies could affect key Indian export sectors such as chemicals, machinery, textiles, and electronics. In the short term, diversifying export  markets  is  essential,  while  medium-term  efforts  should  focus  on  increasing market  share.  Over  the  long  term,  India  must  position  itself  as  a  strategic  partner in  high-value  sectors  like  biotechnology  and  semiconductors.  Strategic  technology partnerships provide opportunities for enhanced cooperation in key areas like space, semiconductors, quantum technologies and advanced telecommunications.\n\n## Financial  sector  prospects  amid  a  moderation  of  growth  in  credit disbursal\n\n1.60 The banking and financial sector remains stable and well-capitalised, and is catering to the financing needs of the economy. While credit disbursal by scheduled commercial banks (SCBs) is growing in double-digits, there has been a moderation in the growth in recent months. This is on the back of a high base and also due to regulatory tightening in sectors where high growth was observed. In view of high growth in certain components of  consumer credit, the RBI had, on 16th November 2023 36 , raised the risk weights on unsecured retail loans by 25 basis points. However, expansion in the segment continues to be broad-based, with housing loans as the major contributor. Apart from personal loans, credit to the services sector is the other major driver of expansion in gross bank credit. Industrial credit growth is picking up but remains below growth rates in other major sectors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Calculations based on credit figures in Table no. 170 - Deployment of Gross Bank Credit by Major Sectors, Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy.\n\n1.61  Stability  in  the  banking  sector  is  underscored  by  declining  asset  impairments, robust capital buffers, and strong operational performance. As per the RBI's Financial Stability  Report  (FSR),  December  2024 37 ,  the  gross  non-performing  assets  (NPAs) in  the  banking system have declined to a 12-year low of 2.6 per cent of gross loans and  advances.  The  capital-to-risk-weighted  assets  ratio  (CRAR)  for  SCBs  stands  at 16.7 per cent as of September 2024, well above the norm. The profitability of SCBs improved during H1 FY25, with profit after tax (PAT) surging by 22.2 per cent YoY, while the Return on Equity (RoE) and Return on Assets (RoA) have improved on a YoY basis. Macro stress tests suggest that banks' overall capital levels would stay above the regulatory minimum even in adverse scenarios.\n\n36 https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=12567&amp;Mode=0.\n\n37  Reserve Bank of India. (2024, December). Financial Stability Report. https://tinyurl.com/zv662e5d.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1.62 While  the  long-term  stability  of  the  banking  system  is  safeguarded,  there  was scrutiny  over  the  short-term  dynamics  emerging  from  the  mismatch  of  credit  and deposit growth rates. The RBI FSR's (June 2024) 38  analysis of previous episodes where credit growth outpaced deposit growth shows that the average duration of such cycles where credit growth exceeds deposit growth is 41 months. The merger of a bank with a  non-bank has elongated the cycle in this episode. The analysis reveals that credit growth precedes deposit growth and that convergence is usually achieved through a fall in credit growth.\n\n1.63 Another area of concern within the banking system is the stress on unsecured credit,  i.e.,  personal  loans  and  credit  cards.  As  of  September  2024,  51.9  per  cent  of the fresh addition to the stock of NPAs in the retail loan portfolio emanated from the slippages in the unsecured loan book. 39  The RBI FSR (December 2024) notes that nearly half of borrowers with credit card and personal loans also have another active retail loan, often substantial, such as a housing or vehicle loan. When a borrower defaults on any loan category, financial institutions classify all loans of that borrower as nonperforming. Hence, their larger, secured loans face delinquency risks due to defaults in smaller personal loans.\n\n1.64 Apart from active monitoring of the banking system, there is a need to be cautious regarding  developments  in  the  Indian  and  global  stock  markets.  While  the  Indian financial  sector  shows  resilience,  international  market  conditions  may  have  some influence  on  India.  Any  correction  in  the  US  stock  market  could  have  implications for global markets (See Box II.2 of the Survey for an analysis pertaining to the Indian market).\n\n38 Reserve Bank of India.

As per the 2023-24 annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) report, the unemployment rate for individuals aged 15 years and above has steadily declined from 6 per cent in 2017-18 to 3.2 per cent in 2023-24. The labour force participation rate (LFPR) and the worker-to-population ratio (WPR) have also increased (Chart I.52). In Q2 FY25, the urban unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and above improved slightly to 6.4 per cent compared to 6.6 per cent in Q2 FY24. Both LFPR and WPR also increased during this period.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Annual PLFS report 2023-24, MoSPI\n\nNote: i) LFPR - labour force participation rate, WPR - worker-to-population ratio, UR - unemployment rate ii)Statistics presented are by Usual status for persons aged 15 years and above\n\n1.66 The  formal  sector  in  India  has  seen  significant  growth,  with  net  Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) subscriptions more than doubling from 61 lakh in FY19 to 131 lakh in FY24. In April  -November 2024, net additions reached 95.6 lakh, driven largely by youth. Workers aged 18-25 years contributed to 47 per cent of the net payroll additions. This indicates a growing trend towards formal employment, which enhances workers' access to social security and stability. Government initiatives are playing a key role in enhancing the formalisation of the job market.\n\n1.67  Technological developments over recent years have generated much discussion on the impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on India's labour market. The integration of  AI  into  India's  labour  market  presents  an  opportunity  to  enhance  productivity, elevate workforce quality and create employment, provided, systemic challenges are effectively addressed through robust institutional frameworks. For India, a servicesdriven economy with a youthful and adaptable workforce, the adoption of AI offers\n\nthe  potential  to  support  economic  growth  and  improve  labour  market  outcomes. Prioritising education and skill development will be crucial to equipping workers with the competencies needed to thrive in an AI-augmented landscape. By capitalising on the global infancy of AI, India has the opportunity to prepare its labour force for a future defined by collaboration between human and machine intelligence. An elucidation of these dynamics can be found in Chapter 13.\n\n##",
