    "question": "What is India's GDP growth projection for FY 2025-26?",
    "answer": "India's GDP growth projection for FY2025-26 is estimated to be between 6.3 and 6.8 per cent. This projection is mentioned in multiple documents, including Chapter 1, Summary, and Chapter 1, Subchapter 6, Outlook and Way Forward.\n\nAccording to Chapter 1, Summary, India's economic prospects for FY26 are balanced, with headwinds including elevated geopolitical and trade uncertainties and possible commodity price shocks. Domestically, the translation of order books of the private capital goods sector into sustained investment pick-up, improvements in consumer confidence, and corporate wage pick-up will be key to promoting growth. Rural demand backed by a rebound in agricultural production, anticipated easing of food inflation, and a stable macro-economic environment provide an upside to near-term growth.\n\nIn Chapter 1, Subchapter 6, Outlook and Way Forward, India's growth in FY26 would be between 6.3 and 6.8 per cent. This projection is based on various factors, including rebounding rural demand, investment activity, and a stable macro-economic environment.\n\nAdditionally, Chapter 1, Subchapter 4, Domestic Economy Remains Steady Amidst Global Uncertainties, mentions that India's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth for FY25 is estimated to be 6.4 per cent. Private final consumption expenditure at constant prices is estimated to grow by 7.3 per cent, and gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) at constant prices is estimated to grow by 6.4 per cent.\n\nOverall, the GDP growth projection for FY2025-26 is based on various factors, including domestic demand, investment activity, and global economic trends. \n\nThe 6.3-6.8% growth range for FY26 can be found in: \n- Chapter1 Summary in DOCUMENT1 and DOCUMENT2: \"India's growth in FY26 would be between6.3 and6.8 per cent.\"\n- Chapter1, Subchapter6, Outlook and Way Forward in DOCUMENT1.",

    "question": "Why does the Survey emphasise deregulation for growth?",
    "answer": "The Survey emphasizes deregulation for growth as a crucial strategy to achieve India's medium-term economic aspirations. According to Chapter 5 of the Economic Survey, India needs to achieve a growth rate of around 8% at constant prices for about a decade or two to become Viksit Bharat (Section 5.1). The IMF projects India to become a USD 5 trillion economy by FY28 and reach a size of USD 6.307 trillion by FY30, translating into an annual nominal growth rate of nearly 10.2% in USD terms (Section 5.2).\n\nHowever, the global economy is experiencing geo-economic fragmentation (GEF), which refers to a policy-driven reversal of global economic integration, often guided by strategic considerations (Section 5.6). GEF can lead to a decline in global trade, investment, and economic growth, with estimated output losses ranging from 0.2% to 7% of GDP (Section 5.12). The Survey highlights that India's growth prospects are influenced by the global economic environment, and the country needs to focus on domestic growth levers to enhance economic freedom through deregulation.\n\nThe Survey points out that regulatory compliance burden holds back formalization and labor productivity, limits employment growth, and chokes innovation (Section 5.34). To address this, the government has implemented several structural reforms, including the Goods and Services Tax (GST), Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), and digital infrastructure (Section 5.32). However, further deregulation is necessary to promote economic freedom and growth.\n\nDeregulation is critical for MSME growth, and compliance costs are non-trivial for MSMEs (Section 5.40). The government has undertaken deregulation efforts, including process and governance reforms, simplifying taxation laws, rationalizing labor regulations, and decriminalizing business laws (Section 5.45). States have also participated in deregulation by reducing compliance burdens and simplifying processes.\n\nThe Survey emphasizes that systematic deregulation is essential for India's growth aspirations, and states can undertake systematic deregulation by reviewing regulations for their cost-effectiveness (Section 5.46). The focus on Mittelstand has played a pivotal role in the economic success of countries like Germany, Switzerland, Japan, and Singapore (Section 5.46). Deregulation can catalyze growth, innovation, and competitiveness, and states must prioritize deregulation to enhance economic freedom.\n\nIn particular, the Survey suggests that states can undertake systematic deregulation by:\n\n1. Identifying areas for deregulation: Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) 2.0 should be a state government-led initiative focused on fixing the root causes behind the unease of doing business (Section 5.53).\n2. Thoughtfully comparing the regulations with other states and countries: States should learn from inter-state and inter-country comparisons of regulations to identify opportunities for growth-inducing reforms (Section 5.54).\n3. Estimating the cost of each of these regulations on individual enterprises: Every regulation imposes monetary, opportunity, and state capacity costs (Section 5.54).\n\nBy prioritizing deregulation, India can promote economic freedom, enhance growth prospects, and achieve its medium-term economic aspirations.",

    "question": "What was India's Current Account Deficit in FY 2024-25?",
    "answer": "India's Current Account Deficit (CAD) in FY2024-25 was relatively contained at 1.2 per cent of GDP in Q2 FY25, as mentioned in Chapter 1, Subchapter 4 Content, and also in Chapter 1 Summary of the provided context documents. \n\nThe Current Account Deficit was comfortably financed by the capital account, ensuring external sector stability. This information can be found in both Document1 and Document2, under the same chapter and subchapter. \n\nTo quote exact figures, India's current account deficit (CAD) remains relatively contained at 1.2 per cent of GDP in Q2 FY25, as per the first advance estimates and data provided by the National Statistical Office and the Reserve Bank of India. \n\nNo further calculations or estimates are required, as the exact data is provided in the context documents. \n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, India's Current Account Deficit in FY2024-25 was 1.2 per cent of GDP.",

    "answer": "As of December 2024, India's foreign exchange reserves stood at USD 640.3 billion, sufficient to cover approximately 90% of the country's external debt of USD 711.8 billion (Chapter 3, Subchapter 6). However, the specific value of India's forex reserves as of March 2025 is not provided in the context documents.\n\nThe documents do mention that India's foreign exchange reserves moderated to USD 640.3 billion as of December 2024, and the import cover stood at 10.9 months as of December 2024, enhancing India's ability to weather external shocks (Chapter 3, Subchapter 6). \n\nGiven that the information for March 2025 is not available, we can only confirm the forex reserves value up to December 2024. Therefore, the answer is based on the last available data:\n\nIndia's forex reserves as of December 2024 were USD 640.3 billion. For the specific value as of March 2025, the provided context does not have the required data.",

    "question": "How does the one view the services sector's role in GDP?",
    "answer": "The services sector plays a significant role in India's GDP growth. According to the Economic Survey, the service sector's value-added accounts for about 62% of global GDP, and services have been the growth engine for middle-income countries like China, Thailand, and India in the last decade (Chapter 8, Section 8.2).\n\nIn India, the services sector has been the steadiest contributor to GVA, with its contribution to total GVA at current prices increasing from 50.6% in FY14 to about 55% in FY25 (Chapter 8, Section 8.4). The sector provides employment to approximately 30% of the workforce.\n\nThe growth in the service sector, as measured by YoY change in real GVA by services, has been above 6% in each year in the last decade, except for the Covid-19 pandemic-affected FY21. The average services growth rate before the pandemic was 8%, and the average services growth in the post-pandemic year, i.e., FY23 to FY25, has risen to 8.3% (Chapter 8, Section 8.5).\n\nThe services sector includes various sub-sectors such as trade, repair, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication & services related to broadcasting, financial services, real estate, ownership of dwelling & professional services, and public administration.\n\nThe Purchasing Manager's Index (PMI) - services shows that the service sector remained in the expansionary zone for 41 consecutive months since August 2021. The export of services grew at a trend rate of 11% during FY14 to FY23, at constant prices. Computer services and business services exports account for around 70% of India's services exports.\n\nThe growth of the services sector can be attributed to various factors such as:\n\n*   **Servicification of manufacturing**: Increasing utilization of services in manufacturing production and post-production value addition.\n*   **Digitalization**: Adoption of digital technologies in business processes.\n*   **Infrastructure development**: Expansion of metro networks, enhancement to road networks, and improvements in connectivity.\n\nHowever, the services sector also faces challenges such as:\n\n*   **Global headwinds**: Uncertainty in global policies and geo-political tensions.\n*   **Regulatory frameworks**: Complicated procedures at the grassroots level, regulations, and rules that hinder both manufacturing and services.\n\nTo address these challenges and realize the full potential of the services sector, the government is taking steps to:\n\n*   **Upskill the labor force**: Focus on appropriate skilling of the labor force.\n*   **Simplify regulatory frameworks**: Review and amend complicated procedures at the grassroots level, regulations, and rules.\n*   **Promote digitalization**: Encourage the adoption of digital technologies in business processes.\n\nOverall, the services sector plays a vital role in India's GDP growth, and its continued growth is crucial for the country's economic development.\n\nThe sector's performance can be gauged from various indicators:\n\n*   **Export growth**: India's services export growth accelerated to 12.8% in April-November FY25 from 5.7% in FY24.\n*   **Credit growth**: Total outstanding bank credit to the services sector stands at Rs. 48.5 lakh crore as of November 2024, with a YoY growth in credit to the services sector recorded at 13%.\n*   **Sector-wise performance**: Within the service sector, computer software and professional services recorded the highest YoY credit growth at 22.5% and 19.4%, respectively.\n\nThe services sector's contribution to GDP is expected to continue growing, driven by factors such as digitalization, servicification of manufacturing, and infrastructure development.\n\nThe geographic dispersion of service sector activity across Indian states reveals a pronounced geographic dispersion. Karnataka and Maharashtra account for more than one-fourth of the total service sector GSVA of all the states. These states along with Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat together share more than 50% of the total service sector GSVA.\n\nPublic administration is a unique category that reflects the strength of the state machinery in the state. Financial, real estate, and professional services have very high levels of concentration in a few states.\n\nStates like Karnataka, Telangana, and Kerala excel in services, with high per-capita service GSVA and service shares in GSVA but exhibit only around average industrial per capita GSVA.\n\nMaharashtra and Tamil Nadu typically represent states with reasonably strong industrial and service sectors. Their diversified economies integrate manufacturing with trade, financial services, real estate & professional services.\n\nStates with reform potential include Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Rajasthan, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal.\n\nAs per DPIIT's Business Reforms Action Plan (BRAP), which ranks states based on their performance in introducing business reforms, the states with service intensity backed by industry are the states which have introduced larger numbers of reforms in comparison to their peer states and fall in top achiever and achiever's category.\n\nThe residential real estate market scaled an 11-year high in sales volume in the first six months of 2024.\n\nThe Indian IT/ITeS industry has a leading position globally and has been a significant contributor to the growth of exports.\n\nThe industry has estimated revenues of USD 254 billion, marking a 3.8% YoY growth in FY24.\n\nTech exports reached nearly USD 200 billion, reflecting a growth of 3.3%, while the domestic market is expected to expand by 5.9%, crossing USD 54 billion in FY24.\n\nThe sector maintained its position as a net hirer, adding 60,000 employees to reach a workforce of 5.43 million in FY24.\n\nThe Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) represents a paradigm shift, promoting a democratic and interoperable digital commerce ecosystem, thus fostering inclusivity and equity.\n\nONDC enables buyers and sellers to transact seamlessly across different platforms.\n\nIt helps by reducing customer acquisition costs, enhancing business efficiencies, and expanding choices for merchants and consumers.\n\nThe platform today has 10 active domains, 110 network participants, and close to 6.5 lakh sellers/service providers.\n\nIt has attracted an increasing number of transactions since its launch.\n\nThe service sector accounts for about 55% of the national GVA in FY25.\n\nHowever, the distribution of service sector activity across Indian states reveals a pronounced geographic dispersion.\n\nFor FY23, Karnataka and Maharashtra account for more than one-fourth of the total service sector GSVA of all the states.\n\nThese states along with Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and Gujarat together share more than 50% of the total service sector GSVA.\n\nThese states also have more than 50% of the total industrial GSVA, suggesting that both feed into each other.\n\nOn the other hand, another set of 19 states collectively account for only one-fourth of the service sector GSVA of all the states.\n\nThe government is taking steps to upgrade passenger amenities, including providing train indication boards, coach guidance systems, digital clocks, and public address systems at various stations.\n\nWi-Fi facilities have been provided at 6112 stations to date.\n\nA new policy for the management of mobile catering services was introduced in 2023.\n\nE-ticketing has touched 86% in the reserved sector as of October 2024.\n\nThe passenger reservation system is being redeveloped using cloud-native technologies.\n\nBharat Gaurav trains have been introduced as theme-based tourist circuit trains showcasing India's rich cultural heritage and historical places.\n\nUnder this scheme, 325 trips of Bharat Gaurav trains carrying 1,91,033 tourists have been operated, covering various tourist destinations.\n\nThe tourism sector's contribution to GDP regained the pre-pandemic level of 5% in FY23.\n\nThe tourism sector created 7.6 crore jobs in FY23.\n\nInternational tourist arrivals in India have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in 2023.\n\nThe share of India's international tourist arrivals in world ITAs stands at 1.45% in 2023.\n\nForeign exchange earnings through tourism were USD 28 billion.\n\nIndia received 1.8% of world tourism receipts and attained a rank of 14th worldwide in world tourism receipts during 2023.\n\nIndia's real estate market witnessed robust performance under office demand and residential sales driven by economic stability and positive market sentiment.\n\nThe demand for real estate is emerging not only in tier 1 and tier 2 cities but across the country due to the expansion of metro networks, enhancement to road networks, and improvements in connectivity.\n\nHousing demand in India is expected to touch 93 million units by 2036.\n\nThe rise of real estate investment trusts (REITs) further amplifies the positive trajectory of the commercial sector.\n\nThe residential real estate market scaled an 11-year high in sales volume in the first six months of 2024.\n\nThe Indian IT/ITeS industry has a leading position globally and has been a significant contributor to the growth of exports.\n\nThe industry has estimated revenues of USD 254 billion, marking a 3.8% YoY growth in FY24.\n\nTech exports reached nearly USD 200 billion, reflecting a growth of 3.3%, while the domestic market is expected to expand by 5.9%, crossing USD 54 billion in FY24.\n\nThe sector maintained its position as a net hirer, adding 60,000 employees to reach a workforce of 5.43 million in FY24.\n\nThe abolition of the angel tax is expected to boost the country's global innovation and entrepreneurial competitiveness.\n\nExpanding the scope of safe harbor rules and streamlining transfer pricing assessment procedures are expected to make the country's transfer pricing regime more attractive and competitive.\n\nIndia's telecom sector is expanding with the smartphone boom, surging data consumption, and the advent of technologies like 5G.\n\nIndia stands as the second-largest telecommunications market, with over 1.18 billion telephone subscribers, an overall teledensity of 84%, and 941 million broadband users as of October 31, 2024.\n\nThe country also leads in mobile data consumption per subscriber and offers the world's most affordable data rates.\n\nIndia's achievement of the fastest 5G rollout globally highlights its technological prowess in the telecom sector.\n\nThe Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) represents a paradigm shift, promoting a democratic and interoperable digital commerce ecosystem, thus fostering inclusivity and equity.\n\nONDC enables buyers and sellers to transact seamlessly across different platforms.\n\nIt helps by reducing customer acquisition costs, enhancing business efficiencies, and expanding choices for merchants and consumers.\n\nONDC recorded more than 14 million transactions in November 2024 across 1100+ cities.\n\nOver 7 lakh sellers and service providers are active on the ONDC network spread across 600+ cities and towns across India.\n\n190+ network participants are live on the network.\n\nPresently, over 7000 farmer producer organizations (FPOs) have registered to be a part of the ONDC network through various seller network participants.\n\nAround 400 self-help groups (SHGs), micro-entrepreneurs, and social sector enterprises have been onboarded on the network.\n\nMobility through the ONDC network is live in 15+ cities with around 5.45 lakh taxi and auto drivers onboarded.\n\nThe platform today has 10 active domains, 110 network participants, and close to 6.5 lakh sellers/service providers.\n\nIt has attracted an increasing number of transactions since its launch.\n\nThe service sector accounts for about 55% of the national GVA in FY25.\n\nHowever, the distribution of service sector activity across Indian states reveals a pronounced geographic dispersion.\n\nFor FY23, Karnataka and Maharashtra account for more than one-fourth of the total service sector GSVA of all the

GSVA, suggesting that both feed into each other.\n\nOn the other hand, another set of 19 states collectively account for only one-fourth of the service sector GSVA of all the states.\n\nPublic administration is a unique category that reflects the strength of the state machinery in the state.\n\nThis is majorly determined by the strength of the state's own revenues, central transfers including tax devolution and borrowing of the state, which together define the spending capacity of the state.\n\nThis is independent of other services which are largely commercially driven.\n\nThere are four different scenarios in the relationship between services share in total GSVA and services GSVA per capita.\n\nStates like Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, and Mizoram have more than a third of their services GSVA coming from trade, repair, hotels, and restaurants, partly because of tourism.\n\nMany bigger states have trade and repair intensity of close to or higher than the national average indicating a large presence of low-value-adding trade in these states.\n\nMany of these states are relatively less industrialized also.\n\nFinancial, real estate, and professional services have very high levels of concentration in a few states.\n\nWithin the service sector, financial services are highly concentrated with Maharashtra (Mumbai), Tamil Nadu, Gujarat (GIFT City), and Karnataka accounting for more than 50% of total financial services GSVA.\n\nKarnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana, Haryana, Tamil Nadu have more than one-third of their services GSVA coming from real estate, ownership of dwelling & professional services.\n\nThe states like Karnataka, Telangana, and Kerala excel in services, with high per-capita service GSVA and service shares in GSVA but exhibit only around average industrial per capita GSVA.\n\nMaharashtra and Tamil Nadu typically represent states with reasonably strong industrial and service sectors.\n\nTheir diversified economies integrate

reforms, the states with service intensity backed by industry are the states which have introduced larger numbers of reforms in comparison to their peer states and fall in top achiever and achiever's category.\n\nThus, introducing business reforms is essential to industrial as well as service development in the state.\n\nAs per the annual survey of unincorporated sector enterprises 2022-23, the number of estimated enterprises belonging to the unincorporated sector stands at 6.5 crore.\n\n72",

    "question": "What about climate shocks and inflation?",
    "answer": "Climate shocks and their impact on inflation are significant concerns in the global economic landscape. According to the context documents, climate-related shocks have contributed to higher prices and rising inflation. The documents mention that \"adverse developments like the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Israel-Hamas conflict increased regional instability. These events impacted energy and food security, leading to higher prices and rising inflation\" (Subchapter3 Content, 1.2). This indicates that geopolitical tensions and conflicts, which can be exacerbated by climate shocks, have led to increased prices and inflation.\n\nFurthermore, the documents highlight that \"recent disruptions in global shipping have pushed goods prices up. These events have also pressurised the global supply chains\" (Subchapter3 Content, 1.14). Climate-related shocks, such as extreme weather events, can disrupt global supply chains, leading to increased prices and inflation.\n\nThe documents also note that \"the risk to inflation from increases in commodity prices seems limited in 2025-2026. After softening in 2024, commodity prices are expected to decline moderately\" (Subchapter3 Content, 1.15). However, climate shocks can impact commodity prices, leading to increased inflation.\n\nIn the context of India's economy, the documents mention that \"India will need to improve its global competitiveness through grassroots-level structural reforms and deregulation to reinforce its medium-term growth potential\" (Chapter1 Summary). This implies that India needs to address various challenges, including those related to climate shocks and inflation, to achieve sustained growth.\n\nIn conclusion, climate shocks can have a significant impact on inflation, primarily through their effects on energy and food security, global supply chains, and commodity prices. The documents highlight the importance of addressing these challenges to achieve sustained growth and stability in the global economy.\n\nReferences:\n- Subchapter3 Content, 1.2\n- Subchapter3 Content, 1.14\n- Subchapter3 Content, 1.15\n- Chapter1 Summary",

    "question": "How is agriculture framed as a sector of the future?",
    "answer": "The agriculture sector is framed as a vital and promising sector for India's future, with significant potential for growth, employment generation, and sustainable development. According to the Economic Survey, the agricultural sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience, with consistent growth rates averaging 5% annually from FY17 to FY23, contributing approximately 16% to the country's GDP and supporting about 46.1% of the population (Chapter 9, Summary).\n\nThe sector's growth potential is substantial, with opportunities for agro-based entrepreneurship and employment generation. The government has launched several initiatives to support farmers, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN) and the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Maandhan Yojna (PMKMY) (Chapter 9, Summary). These initiatives aim to enhance productivity, promote crop diversification, and increase farmers' income.\n\nThe agricultural sector is also seen as a critical component of India's economic growth, with the food processing industry accounting for 12.41% of total employment in the organized sector. The government has initiated programs to foster growth in the food processing sector, including the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) and the Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing (PLISFPI) (Chapter 9, Summary).\n\nFurthermore, the allied sectors, such as livestock and fisheries, have emerged as significant engines of growth in agriculture, with the livestock sector alone representing 5.5% of the total GVA in FY23 and growing at a robust CAGR of 12.99% (Subchapter 11, Content). The fisheries sector has also demonstrated high growth, with a CAGR of 13.67% during FY15 to FY23 (Chapter 9, Summary).\n\nThe sector's growth is crucial for ensuring food security and achieving sustainable development goals. The government has implemented various initiatives to address challenges, including climate variability, soil degradation, and water scarcity. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for essential crops acts as a safety net for farmers, providing a guaranteed minimum price for their crops (Chapter 9, Summary).\n\nIn conclusion, agriculture is framed as a sector of the future, with significant potential for growth, employment generation, and sustainable development. The government's initiatives and investments in the sector aim to enhance productivity, promote crop diversification, and increase farmers' income, ultimately contributing to India's economic growth and sustainable development goals.\n\nReferences:\n\n* Chapter 9, Summary (Document 1, 2, and 3)\n* Subchapter 11, Content (Document 1)\n* Subchapter 2, Content (Document 2)",
